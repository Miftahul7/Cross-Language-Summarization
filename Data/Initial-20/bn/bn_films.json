This article is part of a chapter in my forthcoming dissertation on the films of Ritwik Ghatak for the Department of South Asian Languages and Civilizations at the University of Chicago. I would like to thank the editors at Jump Cut for their invaluable comments that have enhanced this article and my work in general. I would like to particularly thank Jyotiki Virdi for her assistance and persistence. [return to essay] 2. To avoid reader confusion, I must note here the West Bengal Government’s passage of a constitutional amendment declaring from January 1, 2001, the beginning of the new millennium, that Calcutta was officially renamed Kolkata. A variety of reasons for the name change were given, ranging from the argument that “the new name would reflect the pronunciation of the city’s name in Bengali and would protect the state’s linguistic identity,” to the contention that the new name “suggests a compromise between acknowledging the city’s colonial past and the need to restore its threatened identity as a Bengali city.” For more on the history of the city’s name, see Krishna Dutta, Calcutta: A Cultural and Literary History (Northampton: Interlink Books, 2003), pp. 1-4. Given the historical context I am discussing, I will use “Calcutta” throughout this paper. 3. For more on IPTA, see Rustom Bharucha, Rehearsals of Revolution: The Political Theater of Bengal (Honolulu: The University of Hawaii Press, 1983); Eugene Van Erven, The Playful Revolution: Theatre and Liberation in Asia (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1992); and particularly, Sudhi Pradhan, Marxist Cultural Movement in India: Chronicles and Documents, Vols. I-III (Calcutta: Santi Pradhan, 1979-1985), and IPTA, 50th Anniversary Volume of IPTA (Calcutta: 1993). For more on this period of Ghatak’s artistic life see: Atnu Pal, ed. Ritwik Kumar Ghatak (Calcutta: Ritwik Memorial Trust 1988), specifically Ghatak’s lengthy interview in Bengali with Probir Sen, 14-48. This interview has been recently translated into English in Sandipan Bhattacharya and Sibaditya Dasgupta, eds., Ritwik Ghatak: Face to Face (Calcutta: Cinecentral, 2003). In addition to his engagement with theater in the late 1940s, Ghatak began writing short stories, which are collected inBengali in Ritwik Ghataker Golpo (Calcutta: Ritwik Memorial Trust, 1987), and translated into English by Rani Ray in a collection entitled Ritwik Ghatak: Stories (New Delhi: Srishti Publishers, 2001). 4. Bijan Bhattacharya’s Nabanna is about the millions of peasants who died during the Bengal famine of 1943-1944. The inflationary market for rice, heavily demanded by India’s army during World War II, led grain merchants and moneylenders in Calcutta to buy up peasant stocks that should have been kept in villages for food and seed. Bijan Bhattacharya was an actor, writer and founding member of IPTA, who starred in many of Ghatak’s films and was a lifelong friend. Dinabandhu Mitra’s Neeldarpan is about the plight of a Bengali landlord’s family and its tenants at the hands of the British indigo planters in the late 19th century. Both plays were social-political landmarks in both Bengali and Indian theater. 5. On The Cultural Front: A Thesis Submitted by Ritwik Ghatak to the Communist Party of India in 1954 (Calcutta: Ritwik Memorial Trust, 2000. 6. See “Crisis in Bengal IPTA,” in Sudhi Pradhan, ed., Marxist Cultural Movement in India, Vol. 1 (Calcutta: Santi Pradhan, 1979), pp. 324-332. The history of the CPI is also fractious, with a split of the party in 1964 into the CPI and the CPI (Marxist), and the splintering in 1969 of the CPI(M) into the CPI(M) and CPI(Marxist-Leninist). See “The Communist Party,” in Sumanta Banerjee, India’s Simmering Revolution: The Naxalite Uprising (London: Zed Books, 1984), pp. 58-81. 7. See “Paradise Café” in Mrinal Sen, Montage: Life. Politics. Cinema. (Calcutta: Seagull Books, 2002), pp. 105-109. In 1947, Chidananda Das Gupta (the noted Indian film critic) and Satyajit Ray (India’s first internationally recognized filmmaker) formed the Calcutta Film Society, which for the first time introduced many novice Bengali filmmakers, such as Ghatak and Sen, to European and Soviet films. 8. See Sen, Montage, pp. 106-108 and Ritwik Ghatak, Cinema and I (Calcutta; Ritwik Memorial Trust, 1987), p. 110 for details of Ghatak’s union activities. 9. For more details of Ghatak’s life and work in English, including a comprehensive filmography, see Rows and Rows of Fences: Ghatak on Cinema (Calcutta: Seagull Books, 2000). Some of the essays and interviews included in this collection were originally in English, and some have been translated into English from Bengali. Much of the material from Cinema and I has been reprinted in Rows and Rows of Fences. 10. The Partition of India in 1947 is commonly referred to as simply “Partition\". It should be noted that in addition to the 1947 Partition and the Bangladeshi War of Independence’s 1971 partition of East Pakistan and West Pakistan into Bangladesh and Pakistan, Bengal suffered another wrenching “partition” in the twentieth century —Lord Curzon’s 1905 partition of Bengal (then a British province) into East Bengal and West Bengal. Britain reunified Bengal in 1911, but the provinces of Bihar and Orissa were created out of Bengali land and the central government’s capital was moved from Calcutta to Delhi, to be renamed New Delhi. For more on the 1905 division of Bengal see, Sumit Sarkar, The Swadeshi Movement in Bengal: 1903-1908 (New Delhi: People’s Publishing House, 1973). For more on the 1971 division of East Pakistan and West Pakistan, see Richard Sisson and Leo E. Rose, War and Secession: Pakistan, India, and the Creation of Bangladesh (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1990). 11. Ghatak instructed “alternative” directors such as John Abraham, Mani Kaul, and Kumar Shahani during his brief but influential time as an instructor and Vice-Principal at the Film and Television Institute of India in Pune from 1964-1965. Beginning in the early 1960s, Ghatak suffered from alcoholism and mental illness. He was hospitalized for the first time in late 1965. For the rest of his life he was in and out of mental hospitals and psychiatric treatment. 12. From 1992-1997, I resided in Calcutta for extended periods of time for language study and dissertation fieldwork. During my various stays, I saw Meghe Dhaka Tara and Subarnarekha, which are in black and white, multiple times in 35 mm. For this paper I worked from excellent, unsubtitled video copies. To assist in translating the films’ dialogue and songs, I have copies of Ghatak’s subtitling spotting sheets (pages that correlate the dialogue with the footage of the film) that are in Bengali and English. The Ritwik Memorial Trust recently reprinted the complete film script of Meghe Dhaka Tara in Bengali, which I am also utilizing. In 2002, the British Film Institute came out with a finely restored Meghe Dhaka Tara on video and DVD. 13. In Bengali, several words exist that have the connotation of “refugee”: chinnamul or “uprooted”; bastuchara or “displaced person”; sharanarthi or “refugee”; and, udvastu or “homeless person.” In the beginning of his article, “Remembered Villages: Representation of Hindu-Bengali Memories in the Aftermath of Partition,” Economic and Political Weekly (August 10, 1996), pp. 2143-2151, Dipesh Chakrabarty does an excellent job of detailing the significance of udvastu as one who has been placed outside of his ancestral, foundational home. 14. To illustrate the intense love and attachment that Bengalis had for pre-Partition Bengal, the subsequent tremendous sense of loss and nostalgia they experienced for their ancestral homes and motherland as a result of Partition, and Ghatak’s ability to tap into those emotions, I offer the following quote: “There was a wound in the heart of my father, a raw wound. Many physicians were consulted—to no effect; consequently, the wound did not heal. He carried this wound with him until the eve of his death. Toward the end of his life, he used to sit quietly. He saw Ritwik’s Meghe Dhaka Tara ten times, Subarnarekha eight times — and until the end of his life he carried with him Ritwik’s Titas Ekti Nadir Nam. [“A River Called Titas”]... Father had no further opportunities to go to Bangladesh [formerly East Bengal]. This sorrow of not being able to return ate into him for the rest of his life. Father intentionally built his house close to the border [between West Bengal and Bangladesh]. He used to say that if I inhaled [the air] here, I would be able to smell the earth of Satkhira, Bagura and Jessore. And just to be able to smell this earth, Father would repeatedly watch [Ritwik’s] Meghe Dhaka Tara, Subarnarekha and Komal Gandhar.” From Loken Ray’s, “Madhokhane bera” (“A Fence in Between”), in Pratidin, (September 1997). See also, Ranabir Samaddar, ed. Reflections on Partition in the East (New Delhi: Vikas Publishing House Pvt Ltd, 1997) and Chakrabarty, “Remembered Villages: Representation of Hindu-Bengali Memories in the Aftermath of Partition.” It is important to emphasize here that in his films, Ghatak does not often directly address the plight of Bengali Muslims in post-Partition Bengal. The narratives and main characters of his films primarily focus on Bengali Hindus. In his “Remembered Villages,” Chakrabarty succinctly articulates this “fundamental problem in the history of modern Bengali nationality, the fact that the nationalist construction of ‘home’ was a Hindu home.” p. 2150. 15. Ghatak, Rows and Rows of Fences, p. 92. 16. From an interview with Ghatak in Chitrabikshan Annual, (1975), as reprinted and translated in Ashish Rajadhyaksha and Amrit Gangar, eds., Ghatak: Arguments and Stories (Bombay: Screen Unit, 1987), p. 92.

Also see Ravi Vasudevan, ed., Making Meaning in Indian Cinema (New Delhi: Oxford University Press, 2000), particularly the section entitled “The 1950s: Melodrama and the Paradigms of Cinematic Modernity,” pp. 99-142. E. Ann Kaplan, in her essay “Melodrama, Cinema and Trauma,” Screen, vol. 42, no. 2 (Summer 2001), pp. 201-205, urges film scholars to examine the relationship between melodrama and “cultural” or “historical” trauma, which I explore in my dissertation on Ghatak’s work. [Go to page 2 of essay] 18. The even larger Indian cinematic context includes other regional cinemas, such as Madrasi (now called Chennai) or Tamil film of south India. Stephen Hughes and Sara Dickey have conducted work in this area. For more on Satyajit Ray, see Satyajit Ray, Our Films, Their Films (Calcutta: Orient Longman Limited, 1976), Andrew Robinson, Satyajit Ray: The Inner Eye (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1989), and Darius Cooper, The Cinema of Satyajit Ray: Between Tradition and Modernity (Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, 2000).

Vasudevan, “Shifting Codes, Dissolving Identities: The Hindi Social Film of the 1950s as Popular Culture,” in Making Meaning in Indian Cinema, pp. 99-121. One of the main critiques of popular Indian commercial cinema that Vasudevan is referring to emanates from members of the Calcutta Film Society, particularly the writings of film critic Chidananda Das Gupta. 20. Ashish Rajadhyaksha and Paul Willemen, eds., Encyclopedia of Indian Cinema (New Delhi: Oxford University Press, 1999), p. 147. Rajadhyaksha’s Ritwik Ghatak: A Return to the Epic (Bombay: Screen Unit, 1982) is one of the first and few books in English to analyze Ghatak’s films. 21. In 1950s and 1960s Bengali commercial cinema, the melodramatic films of the star duo Uttam Kumar and Suchitra Sen also greatly added to the genre’s popularity. See Moinak Biswas’ “The Couple and Their Spaces: Harano Sur as Melodrama Now,” in Vasudevan, Making Meaning in Indian Cinema, pp. 122-142. 22. See Kapur’s “Articulating the Self into History: Ritwik Ghatak’s Jukti Takko Ar Gappo,” in her insightful and engaging collection, When Was Modernism: Essays in Contemporary Cultural Practice in India (New Delhi: Tulika Books, 2000), pp. 181-200, and Shahani’s various articles on Ghatak collected in Rajadhyaksha and Gangar, eds., Ghatak: Arguments and Stories, 1987. Additional compelling readings of Ghatak's films include Raymond Bellour's meticulous formalist analysis of Meghe Dhaka Tara, entitled \"The Film We Accompany,\" and Moinak Biswas' examination of several of Ghatak's films in \"Her Mother's Son: Kinship and History in Ritwik Ghatak\". Both of these essays are in Rouge, (2004) at http://www.rouge.com.au/index.html. 23. The Upanishads are philosophical and mystical texts of India, believed to have been composed from around 700 B.C.E. onwards. From Carl Jung, Ghatak derived the idea of the archetype. As Pravina Cooper has observed: “The individual, Ghatak felt, needed “archetypes” or collective frameworks by which his unconscious could project into the conscious.”, p. 99, in “Ritwik Ghatak between the Messianic and the Material,” Asian Cinema, vol. 10, no. 2 (Spring/Summer 1999), pp. 96-106. 24.

The Bengali folk dramatic form known as jatra (literally “going” or “journey”), combines acting, songs, music, and dance, and is characterized by a stylized delivery and exaggerated gestures and oration. Scholars believe jatra to have originated in the 16th century with the Krishna Jatra of Chaitanya and his devotees. After World War I, nationalistic and patriotic themes were incorporated into jatra. Mukanda Das (1878-1934) and his troupe, the Swadeshi Jatra Party, performed jatras about colonial exploitation, the nationalist struggle, and the oppression of the feudal and caste system. See “jatra” at http://banglapedia.com. 27. See Rajadhyaksha, Ritwik Ghatak: A Return to the Epic. For a good review of this book, see Jasodhara Bagchi, “A Statement of Bias,” Journal of Arts and Ideas, no. 3 (April-June 1983), pp. 51-62. For more on myth, archetype and ritual in Ghatak’s films see, Ira Bhaskar, “Myth and Ritual: Ghatak’s Meghe Dhaka Tara,” Journal of Arts and Ideas, no. 3 (April-June 1983), pp. 43-50. In “Genres in Indian Cinema,” Sanjeev Prakash describes Ghatak’s use of myth and metaphor as “ultrareal,” Journal of Arts and Ideas, no. 9 (Oct.-Dec. 1984), pp. 23-33. 28. Ghatak, Rows and Rows of Fences, pp. 21-22. 29. Significant to Ghatak’s use of “tradition” or the “traditional” in the context of the “modern” or “modernity” is Geeta Kapur’s contextulization of the terms in “Detours from the Contemporary” (in When Was Modernism: Essays in Contemporary Cultural Practice in India, p. 267): “The persistence of the terms ‘tradition’ and ‘modernity’ as they figure in third-world debates are best appreciated if we see them as notations within the cultural polemic of decolonization. They may be used in all earnestness as essential categories and real options, but in fact they are largely pragmatic features of nation-building and mark the double (or multiple) register of a persuasive nationalist discourse. Sufficiently historicized, both tradition and modernity can notate a radical purpose in the cultural politics of the third world. Certainly the term tradition as we use it in the present equation for India and the third world is not what is given or received as a disinterested civilizational legacy, if ever there should be such a thing. This tradition is what is invented in the course of a struggle. It marks off the territories/identities of a named people. In this sense it is a signifier drawing energy from an imaginary resource – the ideal tradition. Yet it always remains, by virtue of its strongly ideological import, an ambivalent and often culpable sign in need of constant historical interpretation so that we know which way it is pointing.” 30. Ghatak references Brecht throughout Rows and Rows of Fences, especially pp. 22 and 34, and Ritwik Ghatak: Face to Face, particularly pp. 13 and 105. 31. Throughout the essays and interviews in Rows and Rows of Fences, Ghatak discusses the impact of these theatrical and cinematic forms and styles on his work. Eisenstein’s Battleship Potemkin and Bunuel’s Nazarin were two of Ghatak’s favorite films. 32. See Christine Gledhill’s excellent anthology, Home is Where the Heart Is: Studies in Melodrama and the Woman’s Film (London: British Film Institute, 1987). 33. The worship of Ma, the Mother Goddess (in the form of Durga), is a daily practice for many Bengalis. The Durga-Puja festival is the most important Hindu religious festival in Bengal. 34. For examinations of the relationship between music and image in film (although primarily Hollywood film), see James Buhler, Caryl Flinn, and David Neumeyer, eds., Music and Cinema (Hanover, NH: Wesleyan University Press, 2000), Caryl Flinn, Strains of Utopia: Gender, Nostalgia, and Hollywood Film Music (Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 1992), Kathryn Kalinak, Settling the Score: Music and the Classical Hollywood Film (Madison, Wisconsin: University of Wisconsin Press, 1992), and Claudia Gorbman, Unheard Melodies: Narrative Film Music (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1987). 35. Caryl Flinn, Strains of Utopia, p. 133. 36. A khayal combines the classicism of dhrupada (where the lyrics are lofty and are strictly developed without flippant embellishments) and the romanticism of thumri (light songs influenced by Urdu-Persian poetry and sung in Hindi). Khayals may be in praise of gods or royal patrons; they may center on divine or human love; and they may be devotional, philosophical or seasonal. For more on khayals, see Sumati Mutatkar, Aspects of Indian Music (New Delhi: Sangeet Natak Akademi, 1987): 84-89. 37. For more on this trope in Bengali thought, see “The Moment of Departure: Culture and Power in the Thought of Bankimchandra,” in Partha Chatterjee, Nationalist Thought and the Colonial World: A Derivative Discourse? (Tokyo: Zed Books Ltd., 1986), particularly, pp. 79-81. For more on this trope in Indian film in general, see Rosie Thomas, “Sanctity and Scandal: The Mythologization of Mother India,” Quarterly Review of Film and Video 11 (1989), pp. 11-30. 38.

For more on Durga see Dulal Chaudhuri, Goddess Durga: The Great Mother (Calcutta: Mrimol Publishers, 1984). The identification of Nita with Durga/Jagadhatari is clear in the film. Ghatak attests to this identification in numerous essays and interviews. See specifically, Haimanti Banerjee, Ritwik Kumar Ghatak: A Monograph (Pune: National Film Archive of India, 1985), pp. 56-57.

Earlier in this chapter, Naficy states: “The space that exile creates in the accented cinema is gendered, but not in the binary fashion of the classical (i.e., Hollywood) cinema. And if gender is coded dyadically, the poles may be reversed. For example, the outside, public spaces of the homeland’s nature and landscape are largely represented as feminine and maternal. The inside, enclosed spaces—particularly those in the domestic sphere—are also predominantly coded as feminine. In that sense, all accented films, regardless of the genre of their directors or protagonists, are feminine texts. These films destabilize the traditional binary schema gender and spatiality because, in the liminality of deterritorialization, the boundaries of gender, genre, and sexuality are blurred and continually negotiated.” (pp. 154-155). 43.

These songs are called vijaya songs and express a mother’s sorrow at the departure of her daughter for the home of her husband. In vijaya songs, the goddess Durga/Uma is represented as a typical young Bengali bride. Vijaya songs are usually sung at Uma’s departure on the tenth and concluding day of Durga Puja which occurs during the month of Asvin in September/October.

I must point out here that “the mighty Shiva of Aryan mythology” is often depicted as “a corpulent and indolent hemp-smoker in Bengali folklore,” thus adding another layer of meaning to Nita’s banishment and symbolic return to Shiva.

We would also like to reminisce on Abdul Jabbar Khan, the trailbazer in our cinema.Abdul Jabbar Khan decided to make Mukh O Mukhosh at a time when only Pakistani, Indian and Hollywood movies were played at the theatres in this land. Distributors and producers, who were mostly non-Bangalees, didn't believe that locals were capable of making quality cinema. In 1953 at a meeting of cultural activists, a certain movie producer F Dossani remarked, \"The climate of this land is not suitable for making films.\" An aggravated Abdul Jabbar Khan who attended the meeting roared, \"Several Indian-Bangla films have been partially shot here, then why would it be impossible to make our own films?\" When Dossani further argued, a worked up Jabbar vowed that if no one made a film in the then East Pakistan within a year, he would make movie on his own and prove once and for all that making a movie here was possible.What started as just a 'challenge' became a milestone in our history. Based on Jabbar's play Dakaat (Dacoit), Mukh O Mukhosh was made. But the journey was not smooth as silk. The actors and most of crew members had no experience in films, the shooting came to a standstill more than once due to floods. It took two years to wrap up the whole shooting process. The negative was then taken to Lahore for editing and printing. Jabbar was given a hard time in Lahore regarding the processing and bringing the final prints home.Excerpts from Jabbar's journal reads, \"I was about to get on board the plane from Lahore when the customs told me I could not take the prints of the movie to East Pakistan. Disheartened, I returned the plane ticket and went to Karachi by train. I didn't want to waste any time and met with the Home Minister of that time, Justice Abdus Sattar regarding the snags I was facing. \"I told him it would be logical for the customs to stop me if I was trafficking the negative to some foreign country but as far I understood, I was just trying to take the negative back to Dhaka which was supposedly a part of Pakistan. Justice Sattar patiently listened to me and asked for the custom collector and told him since I was allowed to bring the negative to Lahore from Dhaka, I should be able to take it back as well. \"After much squabbling, I was assured that I could take the prints and the negative to Dhaka. One good thing out of the nuisance was that I was asked to screen Mukh O Mukhosh at the Azaadi movie-theatre for 200 Bangalee viewers living in Karachi. I was told that apart from some minor problems with the sound, the movie was commendable. I returned to Dhaka the next day.\" That was not the end of Jabbar's struggle. At home he faced difficulties as well. Most distributors and movie-theatre owners were reluctant to screen the movie. Their excuse was the movie wasn't 'super hit' material. Eventually Musharraf Hossain Chowdhury and the owner of the movie-theatre Roopmahal came to Jabbar's aid. In the midst of a flood, Mukh O Mukhosh was released.

ব্যর্থ হলে কলার ভেলায় ভাসিয়ে দেয়া হয় নদীতে। ভাসতে ভাসতে সেই ভেলা নদীর তীরের একটি বেদে বহরের কাছে এসে থামে। বেদে বহরের নিঃসন্তান বেদে সর্দার (সাইফুদ্দিন) তাকে ভালো করে তোলে এবং জোসনা নামেই নিজের নাতনির মতো একজন পেশাদার বেদেনি হিসেবে গড়ে তোলে। জোসনা (অঞ্জু ঘোষ) একদিন রাজবাড়ি থেকে সাপখেলা দেখিয়ে ফেরার পথে বঙ্গরাজের উজিরপুত্র “মোবারক” (নাসির খান) জোসনার সম্মানহানি করতে চায়, আর এমন সময় রাজকুমার “আনোয়ার” (ইলিয়াস কাঞ্চন) এসে তাকে উদ্ধার করে। এক পর্যায়ে তাদের মধ্য গভীর প্রেম হয়ে যায়। বঙ্গরাজ- তার পুত্র যুবরাজ আনোয়ার সকল বিষয়ে এখন পারদর্শী তাই তিনি ঠিক করে উজিরকন্যা “তারা বানু”কে (ফারজানা ববি) পুত্রবধু করে আনোয়ারের উপর রাজ্যের সমস্ত দায়িত্ব অর্পণ করবেন। ঠিক এমন সময় আনোয়ারকে একটি সাপে কাটে, আর তাকে এমন সাপেই কেটেছে যার বিষ নামাতে কোন ওঝাই রাজি হলো না, যখন প্রায় সকল প্রচেষ্টা ব্যর্থ তখনই সেনাপতি পুত্র “রাজ্জাক” (মিঠুন) জোসনাকে সাথে নিয়ে আসে। জোসনা তার নিজের জীবন বাজি রেখে আনোয়ারকে সুস্থ করে তোলে, এর আগে বঙ্গরাজ প্রতিশ্রুতি দেয়- জোসনা আনোয়ারকে সুস্থ করতে পারলে সে যা চাইবে, রাজা রাজসভায় সবার সামনে খুশি হয়ে তাকে তাই দিবেন।\n\nএবার চাওয়ার পালা- পূর্ণ রাজসভায় সবার সামনে জোসনা গানের সুরে কী ধন আমি চাইবো রাজা গো... ও রাজ চাই যে রাজকুমারকে কিন্তু রাজার মতে জোসনার চাওয়ার পরিমাণ এতই বেশি যে তাকে পুরস্কারতো দূরের কথা শেষ পর্যন্ত তিরস্কার করে কপালে রক্ত ঝরিয়ে রাজসভা থেকে বের করে দেয়। এবং বেদে বহরের সব ঘরবাড়ি জ্বালিয়ে পুড়িয়ে তাড়িয়ে দেয় রাজ্য থেকে, এদিকে আনোয়ার এই ঘটনা মায়ের কাছে জানতে পেরে জোসনাকে খুঁজতে বেরিয়ে যায়। খুঁজে পেয়ে জোসনাকে বিয়ে করে নিয়ে আসে প্রাসাদে, পিতা বঙ্গরাজের কথা অমান্য করে জোসনাকে বিয়ে করার অপরাধে বঙ্গরাজ- পুত্র আনোয়ারের মৃত্যুদণ্ড দেন ও পুত্রবধু জোসনাকে পাঠান বনবাসে। রানীমা নিজ কৌশলে জল্লাদের হাত থেকে পুত্র আনোয়ার ও পুত্রবধু জোসনাকে বাঁচিয়ে দুজনকে একসাথে বনবাসে পাঠিয়ে দেন। শুরু হয় তাদের বনবাস জীবন। জোসনার চেয়ে খাবার খেতে চায় না আনোয়ার, সে চায় নিজে কোনো কাজ করবে এবং রাজপুত্র হয়ে গেল কাঠুরিয়া।\n\nদুজনের দিন ভালই যাচ্ছিলো, হঠাৎ একদিন নরসুন্দরের বেশে আগমন ঘটলো উজিরপুত্র মোবারকের। সে ঐ এলাকার জমিদার বাড়িতে আশ্রয় নিয়েছে, মোবারক- আনোয়ার ও জোসনাকে চিনতে পেরে মনে মনে ফন্দি আঁটতে থাকে এবং জমিদার বাড়িতে গিয়ে রাতের আঁধারে কিছু অর্থ ও অলংকার চুরি করে জমিদারের একজন প্রহরীকে হত্যা করে। এবং আনোয়ার ও জোসনার ঘরের পাশে কাঠের স্তুপের মধ্য রেখে আসে। জমিদারের প্রহরী খুন হওয়ায় জোর তালাশ- কে হত্যা করলো তার প্রহরীকে খুঁজতে পাঠালো সব লোক, মোবারক সরাসরি তাদের জানায় এই জঙ্গলে এক তাগড়া জোয়ান স্ত্রী সহ বসবাস করে। জোসনা গেছে ধর্মপিতার (কাজী সাহেবের) কাছে আর এমন সময় জমিদারের প্রহরীরা আনোয়ারকে ধরে নিয়ে যায়, যখন সে জমিদারের প্রশ্নের মুখে তখনই মোবারক রক্ত মাখা খঞ্জর আর চুরি যাওয়া জিনিস পত্র নিয়ে আসে। ফলে বন্দি হয় আনোয়ার, আর জোসনা আনোয়ারকে খুঁজে হয়রান এমনসময় মোবারক তার লালসার শিকার বানাতে চায় তাকে, জোসনা মোবারকের মুখে জ্বলন্ত আগুনের ফুলকি চেপে ধরে পালিয়ে যায়।\n\nএদিকে বঙ্গরাজ যখন পুত্র শোকে কাতর তখন সেনাপতিপুত্র রাজ্জাকের অক্লান্ত পরিশ্রম আর নিষ্ঠা রাজার মন জয় করলে, রাজা তার রাজ্যের সমস্ত দায়িত্ব তুলে দেন রাজ্জাকের হাতে। রানীমা গোপনে রাজ্জাককে জানায় রাজকুমার আনোয়ার এখনো বেঁচে আছে, খুশি হয় রাজ্জাক। এদিকে রাজ্জাকের হাতে রাজ্যের দায়িত্ব তুলে দেয়ায় লোভী উজির তার কন্যা তারা বানুকে রাজ্জাকের সাথে বন্ধুত্ব করতে বলে। কিন্তু তারা ক্ষোভে দুঃখে আত্মহত্যা করতে গেলে রাজ্জাক তাকে বাঁচায় এবং জানায় রাজকুমার আনোয়ার এখনো বেঁচে আছে। ঘটনাচক্রে প্রেম হয়ে যায় ওদের, রাজ্জাক তারা বানুকে ছেলে সাজিয়ে তারকা নাম দিয়ে রাজকুমারের খোঁজে তার মামা জমিদারের কাছে পাঠায়। জমিদার সাহেব তারাকে ছেলে হিসেবে পেয়ে খুশি হয়, জমিদারের কারাগারে বন্দি থাকা আনোয়ার একবুক কষ্ট নিয়ে গেয়ে উঠে- মা... আমি বন্দি কারাগারে আছিগো মা বিপদে বাইরের আলো চোখে পড়ে না। গান শুনে তারা বেরিয়ে কারাগারের কাছে এসে রাজকুমারকে বন্দি থাকতে দেখে কষ্টে বুক ভেঙে যায় তার। সে মহারাজ জানাতে চাইলে আনোয়ার বাধা দিয়ে বলে আগে আমার জোসনাকে খুঁজে বের করো।\n\nশুরু হয় আনোয়ারের অপরাধের বিচারকার্য বিচারক কাজী সাহেব আনোয়ারকে হত্যার অপরাধে মৃত্যুদণ্ড প্রদান করলে চিৎকার দিয়ে দৌড়ে আসে তার ধর্মমেয়ে (জোসনা) অনুনয় বিনয় করে স্বামীকে ছেড়ে দিতে। কাজী সাহেব জোসনাকে বলেন, মা এটা বিচারালয় আর বিচারালয়ের বিচারকার্য কোনো আবেগের কথা গ্রহণযোগ্য না। তারা একপর্যায়ে উত্তেজিত হয়ে রাজকুমার সম্বোধন করলে কাজী সাহেব জানতে চায় কে রাজকুমার, আনোয়ার; বঙ্গরাজের পুত্র শুনে বিশ্বাস করেন না তিনি। এদিকে তারার পাঠানো বার্তায় রাজ্জাকের মাধ্যমে বঙ্গরাজ তার পুত্র আনোয়ার বেঁচে আছে এবং তারই রাজ্যের অধীনে একটি পরগনার জমিদারের কারাগারে হত্যার দায়ে বন্দি জানতে পেরে সঙ্গে সঙ্গে রওনা দেন সেখানকার উদ্দেশ্যে। সেখানে পৌঁছেই পুত্রকে বিচারালয়ে দেখে বুকে জড়িয়ে নেন তিনি, এবং শ্যালক কাজী সাহেবকে নির্দেশ দেন রাজকুমারকে মুক্তি দেওয়ার জন্য। কিন্তু রাজকুমার যে নির্দোষ প্রমাণ না করতে পারলে এটাই তার চূড়ান্ত সিদ্ধান্ত জানায়, এমন সময় রাজ্জাক উজিরপুত্র মোবারককে ধরে নিয়ে আসে এবং সে সব দোষ স্বীকার করে।\n\nবিচারালয়ে হাজীর জোসনার দাদা-দাদী, জোসনা কাজী সাহেবকে বাবা বলে ডাকলে তার পালনকারী দাদা-দাদী বলে; বাবা এলো কোথা থেকে আমরা তো তোকে সাপে কাটা অবস্থায় নদীতে একটি কলার ভেলায় ভাসানো পেয়েছিলাম। শুনে চমকে উঠে কাজী সাহেব জানতে চায় তখনকার কোনো চিহ্ন আছে কি না, ওনারা একটা চিঠি বের করে দেন তার হাতে।\nকাজী সাহেব চিঠি দেখে চিনতে পারে, জোসনা তার কলার ভেলায় ভাসিয়ে দেওয়া মেয়ে।", "references": []}, {"title": "সংগীত", "content": "বেদের মেয়ে জোসনা চলচ্চিত্রের সংগীত পরিচালনা করেন আবু তাহের। এই চলচ্চিত্রে এগারোটি গান রয়েছে। এই

গান নতুনরূপে পরিবেশিত হয়। বলা চলে ফিউশন গানের অনুষ্ঠান উইন্ড অব চেঞ্জ। বিজ্ঞাপন এর এক ও দুই নম্বর সিজন দারুণ জনপ্রিয় হওয়ায় গেল ঈদে সিজন থ্রি প্রচারিত হয়। এতে গান করেছেন কাঙ্গালিনী সুফিয়া, এন্ড্রু কিশোর, রেজওয়ানা চৌধুরী বন্যা, আগুন, হায়দার হোসেন, শাহানা বাজপায়ী, অর্থহীনের সুমন প্রমুখ। ২০টি দেশের ৩৫ জন সংগীতকার (মিউজিশিয়ান) এতে অংশ নিয়েছেন। যেমন—ড্রামে ছিলেন হাঙ্গেরির গার্গো বরলাই, পারকাসনে ভারতের শিবামনি, বেইজ গিটারে রাশিয়ার আন্তন। ভায়োলিনে ছিলেন পুরো একটি দল—রাশিয়ার আনা রাকিতা, পোল্যান্ডের অ্যালিসিয়া ও মাগদা, রোমানিয়ার অ্যান্দ্রেয়া, ইউক্রেনের রাসালানা প্রমুখ। চেলোতেও ছিলেন একদল—আর্মেনিয়ার আর্তম মানুকিন, পোল্যান্ডের ইসাবেলা, রাশিয়ার আনা প্রমুখ। কি-বোর্ড বাজিয়েছেন লাটভিয়ার আনা ভাইভ ও রোমানিয়ার লরা লাজারেসকু। বাঁশিতে যুক্তরাষ্ট্রের রাশিকা যেমন ছিলেন, পাকিস্তানের আহসানও ছিলেন। এস্রাজ বাজিয়েছেন ভারতের আরশাদ খান। স্পেনের ডানিয়েল ও পাকিস্তানের মিকাল হাসান গিটার বাজিয়েছেন। বিজ্ঞাপন সেই ১৯৮৯ সাল বেদের মেয়ে জোসনা মুক্তি পেয়েছিল ১৯৮৯ সালে। বাংলাদেশের চলচ্চিত্র ইতিহাসের অন্যতম ব্যবসাসফল ছবি। অঞ্জু ঘোষ ও ইলিয়াস কাঞ্চন ছিলেন মুখ্য ভূমিকায়। বেদের মেয়ে জোসনা আমায় কথা দিয়েছে গানটি ব্যাপক জনপ্রিয় হয়েছিল। গানটির সুর করেছিলেন আবু তাহের। গেয়েছিলেন রুনা লায়লা ও এন্ড্রু কিশোর। টালিউডও ছবিটি আবার বানিয়েছিল। সেখানে অভিনয় করেছিলেন অঞ্জু ঘোষ ও চিরঞ্জিত। বেদের মেয়ে জোসনা-২০১৮ বিএফডিসিতে ১৫ এপ্রিল উইন্ড অব চেঞ্জ সিজন থ্রি ধারণ শুরু হয়। পরের দিনই ধারণ করা হয় বেদের মেয়ে জোসনার গানটি। এন্ড্রু কিশোরের সঙ্গে এবার ছিলেন লুইপা। সংগীত পরিচালনায় ছিলেন কৌশিক হোসেন তাপস। ঈদে গানবাংলা টিভিতে প্রচারিত হয়। আর গানবাংলার ইউটিউব চ্যানেলে প্রকাশ পায় ২০ জুন। গানটি এখানে চার লাখেরও বেশি মানুষ দেখেছে। মন্তব্য করেছেন তিন শর বেশি মানুষ। একজন যেমন রাকিবুল ইসলাম। লিখেছেন, অনেক দিন পর আবার নতুন করে গানটা শুনতে পেয়ে অনেক ভালো লাগল। এন্ড্রু কিশোর প্রায় ৩০ বছর আগে গেয়েছেন। এখন আবার গাইলেন। কেমন লাগল? সে সময় ছবিটাকে মাথায় রেখে গানটির সুর ও সংগীত করা হয়েছিল। এবার তো গানটা স্বাধীন। সুর ও সংগীত করা হয়েছে স্বাধীনতা নিয়েই। বেশ অন্য রকম লেগেছে। তখনকার কোনো স্মৃতি? চলচ্চিত্রটির পরিচালক ছিলেন তোজাম্মেল হক বকুল। একদিন তিনি বললেন, বস, আমি নিজের গল্প থেকে একটা সিনেমা করতে যাচ্ছি। আপনাকে দরকার। তারপর আমি, সংগীত পরিচালক তাহের ভাই, প্রযোজক আব্বাস ভাই এবং আরো অনেকে বসলাম। তখন অনেকটা পারিবারিক আবহ ছিল। সবাই কষ্ট করে একটা ছবি তুলতাম। গানগুলোও সবাই মিলেই তৈরি হলো। ছবি মুক্তি পাওয়ার পর গানও হিট হলো। এক মাসে এক লাখ ক্যাসেট বিক্রি হয়ে গিয়েছিল। এটা একটা রেকর্ড। নতুনভাবে গানটি গেয়ে কেমন সাড়া পেলেন? অনেকেই প্রশংসা করেছেন। এমনও শ্রোতা পেলাম, যিনি আগের গানটি শোনেননি। নতুন গানেরই ভক্ত হয়ে গেছেন। যখন বললাম, এটি ৩০ বছর আগের গান, তিনি অবাক হয়ে গেছেন। অনেক সমালোচনাও হচ্ছে? অনেকের কাছে আগের গানটাই ভালো। তাঁরা নতুনটি নিতে পারছেন না। আমি তাঁদের বলি, নতুনটা আপনার পছন্দ না হলে পুরনোটা তো আছেই। এটা একটা চেষ্টা। উৎসাহ দেওয়া দরকার। ভালো কিছু বেরিয়েও আসতে পারে। এ রকম গানের প্রয়োজনীয়তা আছে বলছেন? হ্যাঁ। এভাবে তো গানকে নতুন জীবন দেওয়া হচ্ছে। যাঁরা আগে শুনেছেন তাঁরাও ভিন্ন স্বাদ পাচ্ছেন, আর যাঁরা শোনেননি তাঁরা পরিচিত হচ্ছেন। সম্পাদক : শাহেদ মুহাম্মদ আলী, ইস্ট ওয়েস্ট মিডিয়া গ্রুপ লিমিটেডের পক্ষে ময়নাল

disciplines (Michel Foucault : Discipline and Punish) ১ ‘বেদের মেয়ে জোসনা’ বাংলা চলচ্চিত্রের ইতিহাসে গুরুত্বপূর্ণ একটি ছবি। এই ছবি নিয়ে বিস্তর আলাপ এরই মধ্যে হয়ে গেছে। লেখা হয়েছে ঢাউস ঢাউস সাইজের নাটকীয় রিভিউও। ঘটনাটা বিরাট বলেই নিশ্চয় এই বিশাল আলোচনা। তবে আমরা ওই দিকে না গিয়ে মূল কথায় আসি। ১৯৮৯ সালে মুক্তি পাওয়া এই ছবির একটি গান ‘আমি বন্দি কারাগারে’। গানটি সেদিন যেমন জনপ্রিয় ছিল, আজও তেমন জনপ্রিয়। মুজিব পরদেশীর যেসব গানের জন্য এখনো স্মরিত হন, তার মধ্যে এটি নিশ্চয়ই সবার ওপরে। বলে রাখা ভালো, ‘নির্জন যমুনার কোলে,’ ‘আমার সোনা বন্ধুরে,’ ‘কলমেতে নাই কালি’র মতো সে সময়ে আরো অনেক সুপারহিট গানের স্রষ্টা মুজিব পরদেশী। এখানে একটা বিরতি। তবে এখানে একটা ফুটনোট দিয়েই বিরতিতে যাই, মুজিব পরদেশীর ‘আমি বন্দি কারাগারে’ অ্যালবামের টাইটেল গানটিই মূলত ‘বেদের মেয়ে জোসনায়' ব্যবহার করা হয়। যে অ্যালবাম প্রায় ৫০ লাখের ওপরে বিক্রি হয়েছিল। তবে আমরা আলাপের সুবিধার্থে সেই গানটিকে ছবির গান হিসেবে বিবেচনা করেই আলাপ করব। ২ তার এক বছর পর। মানে ঘটনার সময় ১৯৯০ সাল। একটা অ্যালবাম বাংলা ব্যান্ডের ইতিহাসে নতুন বিপ্লব নিয়ে আসে। ফারুক মাহফুজ আনাম ওরফে জেমসের গলায় ‘ফিলিংসের’ ‘জেল থেকে আমি বলছি’। এই অ্যালবামের টাইটেল গান নিয়েও আমরা টুকটাক কথা বলব। প্রশ্ন হচ্ছে, আগের বছর জেলখানা থেকে ইলিয়াস কাঞ্চন যে কেঁদে কেঁদে বলল ‘আমি বন্দি কারাগারে আমি বন্দি কারাগারে আছি গো মা বিপদে বাইরের আলো চোখে পড়ে না মা আমি বন্দি কারাগারে আমি বন্দি কারাগারে’ এই আলাপ কি যথেষ্ট ছিল না? ইলিয়াস কাঞ্চন কি ঠিকভাবে কাঁদতে পারেননি? তা যদি না হয়, লতিফুল ইসলাম শিবলীকে কেন আবার লিখতে হলো- ‘দিন রাত এখানেই থমকে গেছে কনডেম সেলের পাথর দেয়ালে প্রতি নিঃশ্বাসে মৃত্যুর দিন আমি গুনছি শোনো জেল থেকে আমি বলছি ’ এক জায়গায় বলা হচ্ছে ‘আছি গো মা বিপদে’, একই আলাপ পরের গানে আসছে ‘প্রতি নিঃশ্বাসে মৃত্যুর দিন আমি গুনছি’ এই বয়ান আকারে। আগের গান কি সেই আবেদন তৈরি করতে যথেষ্ট ব্যর্থ? এই দুই জেল কি আসলেই একই জেল? না কি আলাদা কোন ইঙ্গিত বহন করছে? তবে ব্যর্থতা সফলতার বাইরে যে বাহাসটি এখানে গুরুত্বপূর্ণ, তা হলো দুটি গান আলাদা আলাদা অডিয়েন্সকে টার্গেট করে বানানো। একটা পিওর বাংলা ছবির গান। যেখানে একজন জমিদারের হাতে বন্দি শাস্তির জন্য অপেক্ষমাণ রাজকুমারের কান্না। পরবর্তীকালে যার মৃত্যুদণ্ড ঘোষিত হলেও বাংলা ছবির চিরায়ত মহিমায় শেষ পর্যন্ত বন্দি কারাগারের বন্দিদশা থেকে মুক্তি লাভ করেন রাজকুমার আনোয়ার তথা ইলিয়াস কাঞ্চন। যাঁরা ছবি দেখেছেন, তাঁরা জানেন এটা মিশেল ফুকো বর্ণিত আধুনিক কারাগার নয়। এই কারাগার মিথের কারাগার। মূলত ছবিটি মিথনির্ভর। যার প্লট সাজানো হয়েছে জমিদারি প্রথার নিয়মনীতির ওপর ভিত্তি করে। এই কারাগার থেকে জেমসের ‘জেলখানা’ নিরাপদ দূরত্বে অবস্থান করছে। মুজিব পরদেশী বন্দি কারাগারে যেমন জেমসের শ্রোতাদের থাকার সুযোগ নেই, তেমনি জেমসের কারাগারে থাকবে না মুজিব পরদেশীর শ্রোতারা। এই না থাকাটা সাবজেকটিব অ্যাপ্রোচে নয়, এটি একটি গ্র্যান্ড ন্যারেটিভের ধারণা থেকে আসা। যখন ‘বেদের মেয়ে জোসনা’ মুক্তি পায় সারা দেশে। এই ছবি তুমুল সাড়া জাগিয়েছিল। বিশেষ করে গ্রাম, শহুরে নিম্নবিত্ত এবং নিম্ন মধ্যবিত্ত শ্রেণির দর্শকরা ছিল এই ছবির মূল দর্শক। শহুরে দর্শক এই ছবি দেখলেও তারা নিজেদের শ্রেণি সচেতনতার কারণে এই ছবির সঙ্গে নিজেদের কতটা যুক্ত করতে পারবেন সেই প্রশ্ন থেকেই যায়। মুজিব পরদেশীর অনেক গান সে সময় তাদের মুখে মুখে ঘুরছিল। তবে এই ব্লকবাস্টার ছবির হিট গান হিসেবে এই গানটি ব্যাপক জনপ্রিয়তা পেয়েছিল। ৩ এবার আসা যাক জেমসের গানে। এই গানে বর্ণিত জেলের সঙ্গে মিশেল ফুকো বর্ণিত সংশোধানাগারের মিল আছে। যা শৃঙ্খলা তৈরির কাজে অনেক বেশি ব্যবহৃত হয়। সে সময় বাংলাদেশের রাজনৈতিক প্রেক্ষাপটের দিকে তাকালে এই গানটির প্রাসঙ্গিকতা বোঝা যায়। একদিকে স্বৈরাচারী শাসকের অত্যাচার ও জেল-নির্যাতন, অন্যদিকে স্বৈরাচারী শাসকের বিরুদ্ধে আন্দোলনও তখন চরমে। আবার রাষ্ট্রের পোষা সন্ত্রাসীদেরও একধরনের অবস্থান ছিল। সব মিলিয়ে এই গানটি মূলত ফাঁসির দণ্ডপ্রাপ্ত এক যুবকের প্রেমিকার উদ্দেশে গাওয়া। এই গানের যে চরিত্র তার অপরাধ কী? সে কেন মৃত্যুদণ্ড কার্যকরের অপেক্ষায়? সে কি রাষ্ট্রের দুঃশাসনের শিকার, নাকি রাষ্ট্রের তৈরি কোনো চরিত্র অথবা সামাজিক বিশৃঙ্খলায় তৈরি হওয়া চরিত্র? এসব কোনো কিছুই এই গানে পরিষ্কার করা হয়নি। এমনকি অপরাধী আসলেই দোষী কি না, তাও গানের কথায় পরিষ্কার না। তবে এই গানের গীতিকার নিজেই স্বৈরাচারী দুঃশাসনের শিকার হয়েছিলেন এবং পরবর্তী সময়ে তার ভাষ্য থেকে জানা যায়, স্বৈরাচারী শাসনের দ্বারা আক্রান্ত হওয়ার পর নিজের জেলে যাওয়ার অভিজ্ঞতা থেকে এই গানের জন্ম হয়েছিল। এ ছাড়া এই গান নিয়ে নানা নাটকীয় ঘটনা আছে, সেই আলাপ অন্যত্র করা যাবে। যারা এই গানের শ্রোতা, তারা নিশ্চয় এত কিছু জেনেবুঝে গান শুনতে যাবে না। তার কাজ গান শুনে তার সঙ্গে নিজেকে যুক্ত করা। এই জায়গায় দুই গানই সফল, কারণ তারা টার্গেট অডিয়েন্সকে নিজেদের দিকে টানতে পেরেছিল। তবে কখনো কখনো কোনো কোনো শ্রোতার শ্রেণিচ্যুতিও নিশ্চয় ঘটেছে। তবে মধ্যবিত্ত শিক্ষিত যখন ‘আমি বন্দি কারাগারে’ শুনতে গেছে, তখন সে স্রেফ কালচারাল এলিটিজম ফলানোর জন্য এই কাজটি করেছে। আর নিম্নমধ্যবিত্ত শ্রেণির লোকজনের জেমসের এই গান শোনার পেছনে কারণ হতে পারে মধ্যবিত্তে উত্তীর্ণ হওয়ার রোমান্টিসিজম। যদিও এই সংখ্যাটি বিরল। ৪ এবার আসা যাক মিশেল ফুকোতে। ‘বেদের মেয়ে জোসনা’ ছবির প্রেক্ষিতে যে শাস্তি তা মূলত ফুকো বর্ণিত ‘রাজকীয় শাস্তির’ ধরন থেকে কিছুটা উত্তীর্ণ। এখানে প্রাক এনলাইটমেন্ট পর্যায়ের অনেক ব্যাপারস্যাপার রয়েছে। ১৭৫৭ সালের ফুকো বর্ণিত সেই ব্রুটালিটিও এই ছবিতে নেই। বরং এই ছবিকে এনলাইটমেন্টে আসার আগ মুহূর্তের ডিসিপ্লিন শিক্ষার ড্রেস রিহার্সালও বলা যেতে পারে। যেখানে রাজার ছেলেকেও অপরাধের কারণে শাস্তি পেতে হচ্ছে। কিন্তু সে নায়ক। তাঁকে মারার ক্ষমতা কারো নেই। এই জেল-জুলুম অনেক বেশি রোমান্টিক ধ্যানধারণায় আক্রান্ত। আর জেমসের ‘জেল থেকে বলছি’ ফুকোর আধুনিক কারাগারের বর্ণনার সঙ্গে সাদৃশ্যপূর্ণ এবং অনেক বেশি সমসাময়িক। গায়কের কণ্ঠেই বোঝা যায় এই শাস্তি অফেরতযোগ্য। যা তাঁকে পেতেই হবে এবং সেটা নিয়ন্ত্রণ করছে অন্য কেউ। শেষ পর্যন্ত এই গানের চরিত্র কিংবা জেমস আসলে সেই নায়ক যাঁর নায়ক হয়ে ওঠার ক্ষমতা নেই। জেরেমি বেনথামের প্যানোপটিকন থিওরির চৌকিদারের বরং এখানে নায়ক হয়ে ওঠার সম্ভাবনা অনেক বেশি। ৫ জেমসের গানটি মূলত সেই সময়ের ভয়াবহ নৈরাজ্যের স্মারক। যার মেজাজ বন্দি কারাগারের মিথের চেয়ে আলাদা। তবে বাংলা ছবি মাত্রই ভালোর জয় এবং দুষ্টের পতন। সেই অর্থে ‘বন্দি কারাগারকেও’ আপনি চাইলে একদিক থেকে ‘জেল থেকে বলছি’র মতো করে সিম্বোলাইজ করতে পারবেন। কারণ শেষ পর্যন্ত স্বৈরাচারী এরশাদ সরকারের পতন হয়েছিল এবং রাজকুমার আনোয়ার নির্দোষ প্রমাণিত হয়েছিলেন। তবে তারপরও একটা বড় প্রশ্ন থেকেই যায়, তা হলো, এতকিছুর পর ‘জেল থেকে বলছি’র সেই চরিত্রের জেল থেকে মুক্তি মিলেছে কি না? আধুনিক রাষ্ট্রব্যবস্থায় ব্যক্তির মুক্তি কিংবা শাস্তির মধ্যদিয়ে জেল-জুলুমের সিলসিলা শেষ হয়ে যায় না। সেদিক থেকে হয়তো সে চরিত্র এখনো কারাগারে মৃত্যুর জন্য অপেক্ষমাণ। অনেক আগে তার মৃত্যু ঘটার পরও। ৬ আরেকটি গুরুত্বপূর্ণ দিক হলো দুই গানের ভাষা এবং উপাদান। জেমসের গান প্রেমিকাকে উদ্দেশ্য করে একেবারে টনটনে প্রমিত ভাষায়। যেখানে প্রেমিকার চুলের মৃদু গন্ধের কথা মনে করছে নায়ক। অন্যদিকে মুজিব পরদেশীর ‘বন্দি কারাগারে’ মূলত মাকে উদ্দেশ্য করে। সেই সঙ্গে এই গানের কথায় এমন সব উপাদান এসেছে, যা আবার ‘জেল থেকে বলছি’র চরিত্র থেকে সম্পূর্ণ আলাদা। যদিও প্রমিত এবং আঞ্চলিক মিলিয়ে মিশিয়ে এই গানটি তৈরি। তবে এই গানের লিরিকের কিছু অংশ মধ্যবিত্ত রুচি থেকে অনেক দূরে অবস্থান করছে। ‘দুইটি রুটি দেয় রুটি খেয়ে পেট ভরে না’ কিংবা ‘প্রাণে যে মানে না মশার কামড়ে ঘুম ধরে না’ এই কথাগুলো শিবলীর কাছ থেকে অপ্রতাশ্যিত। মূলত নিজের শ্রেণিগত অবস্থানের কারণে শিবলী এ ধরনের লিরিক লিখবেন না বা লিখতে পারবেন না। কারণ তাঁর টার্গেট অডিয়েন্স বা যে শ্রেণির জন্য তিনি গান লিখছেন তাঁরা এ ধরনের লিরিকের জন্য প্রস্তুত থাকেন না। অন্যদিকে ঠিক একই কারণে মুজিব পরদেশী ‘জেল থেকে বলছি’র মতো লিরিকের সঙ্গে নিজেকে যুক্ত করতে পারবেন না। এখানে শ্রেণি একটা বিশাল দেয়াল হয়ে দাঁড়িয়ে আছে। তবে কোনো কোনো ক্ষেত্রে নিজ নিজ শ্রেণির গণ্ডি পেরিয়ে যেতে পেরেছে দুটি গানই। যার ফলে এখনো একইভাবে বাংলা গানের ধারায় নিজেদের অবস্থান জারি রাখতে

ইলিয়াস কাঞ্চন কি ঠিকভাবে কাঁদতে পারেননি? তা যদি না হয়, লতিফুল ইসলাম শিবলীকে কেন আবার লিখতে হলো- ‘দিন রাত এখানেই থমকে গেছে কনডেম সেলের পাথর দেয়ালে প্রতি নিঃশ্বাসে মৃত্যুর দিন আমি গুনছি শোনো জেল থেকে আমি বলছি ’ এক জায়গায় বলা হচ্ছে ‘আছি গো মা বিপদে’, একই আলাপ পরের গানে আসছে ‘প্রতি নিঃশ্বাসে মৃত্যুর দিন আমি গুনছি’ এই বয়ান আকারে। আগের গান কি সেই আবেদন তৈরি করতে যথেষ্ট ব্যর্থ? এই দুই জেল কি আসলেই একই জেল? না কি আলাদা কোন ইঙ্গিত বহন করছে? তবে ব্যর্থতা সফলতার বাইরে যে বাহাসটি এখানে গুরুত্বপূর্ণ, তা হলো দুটি গান আলাদা আলাদা অডিয়েন্সকে টার্গেট করে বানানো। একটা পিওর বাংলা ছবির গান। যেখানে একজন জমিদারের হাতে বন্দি শাস্তির জন্য অপেক্ষমাণ রাজকুমারের কান্না। পরবর্তীকালে যার মৃত্যুদণ্ড ঘোষিত হলেও বাংলা ছবির চিরায়ত মহিমায় শেষ পর্যন্ত বন্দি কারাগারের বন্দিদশা থেকে মুক্তি লাভ করেন রাজকুমার আনোয়ার তথা ইলিয়াস কাঞ্চন। যাঁরা ছবি দেখেছেন, তাঁরা জানেন এটা মিশেল ফুকো বর্ণিত আধুনিক কারাগার নয়। এই কারাগার মিথের কারাগার। মূলত ছবিটি মিথনির্ভর। যার প্লট সাজানো হয়েছে জমিদারি প্রথার নিয়মনীতির ওপর ভিত্তি করে। এই কারাগার থেকে জেমসের ‘জেলখানা’ নিরাপদ দূরত্বে অবস্থান করছে। মুজিব পরদেশী বন্দি কারাগারে যেমন জেমসের শ্রোতাদের থাকার সুযোগ নেই, তেমনি জেমসের কারাগারে থাকবে না মুজিব পরদেশীর শ্রোতারা। এই না থাকাটা সাবজেকটিব অ্যাপ্রোচে নয়, এটি একটি গ্র্যান্ড ন্যারেটিভের ধারণা থেকে আসা। যখন ‘বেদের মেয়ে জোসনা’ মুক্তি পায় সারা দেশে। এই ছবি তুমুল সাড়া জাগিয়েছিল। বিশেষ করে গ্রাম, শহুরে নিম্নবিত্ত এবং নিম্ন মধ্যবিত্ত শ্রেণির দর্শকরা ছিল এই ছবির মূল দর্শক। শহুরে দর্শক এই ছবি দেখলেও তারা নিজেদের শ্রেণি সচেতনতার কারণে এই ছবির সঙ্গে নিজেদের কতটা যুক্ত করতে পারবেন সেই প্রশ্ন থেকেই যায়। মুজিব পরদেশীর অনেক গান সে সময় তাদের মুখে মুখে ঘুরছিল। তবে এই ব্লকবাস্টার ছবির হিট গান হিসেবে এই গানটি ব্যাপক জনপ্রিয়তা পেয়েছিল। ৩ এবার আসা যাক জেমসের গানে। এই গানে বর্ণিত জেলের সঙ্গে মিশেল ফুকো বর্ণিত সংশোধানাগারের মিল আছে। যা শৃঙ্খলা তৈরির কাজে অনেক বেশি ব্যবহৃত হয়। সে সময় বাংলাদেশের রাজনৈতিক প্রেক্ষাপটের দিকে তাকালে এই গানটির প্রাসঙ্গিকতা বোঝা যায়। একদিকে স্বৈরাচারী শাসকের অত্যাচার ও জেল-নির্যাতন, অন্যদিকে স্বৈরাচারী শাসকের বিরুদ্ধে আন্দোলনও তখন চরমে। আবার রাষ্ট্রের পোষা সন্ত্রাসীদেরও একধরনের অবস্থান ছিল। সব মিলিয়ে এই গানটি মূলত ফাঁসির দণ্ডপ্রাপ্ত এক যুবকের প্রেমিকার উদ্দেশে গাওয়া। এই গানের যে চরিত্র তার অপরাধ কী? সে কেন মৃত্যুদণ্ড কার্যকরের অপেক্ষায়? সে কি রাষ্ট্রের দুঃশাসনের শিকার, নাকি রাষ্ট্রের তৈরি কোনো চরিত্র অথবা সামাজিক বিশৃঙ্খলায় তৈরি হওয়া চরিত্র? এসব কোনো কিছুই এই গানে পরিষ্কার করা হয়নি। এমনকি অপরাধী আসলেই দোষী কি না, তাও গানের কথায় পরিষ্কার না। তবে এই গানের গীতিকার নিজেই স্বৈরাচারী দুঃশাসনের শিকার হয়েছিলেন এবং পরবর্তী সময়ে তার ভাষ্য থেকে জানা যায়, স্বৈরাচারী শাসনের দ্বারা আক্রান্ত হওয়ার পর নিজের জেলে যাওয়ার অভিজ্ঞতা থেকে এই গানের জন্ম হয়েছিল। এ ছাড়া এই গান নিয়ে নানা নাটকীয় ঘটনা আছে, সেই আলাপ অন্যত্র করা যাবে। যারা এই গানের শ্রোতা, তারা নিশ্চয় এত কিছু জেনেবুঝে গান শুনতে যাবে না। তার কাজ গান শুনে তার সঙ্গে নিজেকে যুক্ত করা। এই জায়গায় দুই গানই সফল, কারণ তারা টার্গেট অডিয়েন্সকে নিজেদের দিকে টানতে পেরেছিল। তবে কখনো কখনো কোনো কোনো শ্রোতার শ্রেণিচ্যুতিও নিশ্চয় ঘটেছে। তবে মধ্যবিত্ত শিক্ষিত যখন ‘আমি বন্দি কারাগারে’ শুনতে গেছে, তখন সে স্রেফ কালচারাল এলিটিজম ফলানোর জন্য এই কাজটি করেছে। আর নিম্নমধ্যবিত্ত শ্রেণির লোকজনের জেমসের এই গান শোনার পেছনে কারণ হতে পারে মধ্যবিত্তে উত্তীর্ণ হওয়ার রোমান্টিসিজম। যদিও এই সংখ্যাটি বিরল। ৪ এবার আসা যাক মিশেল ফুকোতে। ‘বেদের মেয়ে জোসনা’ ছবির প্রেক্ষিতে যে শাস্তি তা মূলত ফুকো বর্ণিত ‘রাজকীয় শাস্তির’ ধরন থেকে কিছুটা উত্তীর্ণ। এখানে প্রাক এনলাইটমেন্ট পর্যায়ের অনেক ব্যাপারস্যাপার রয়েছে। ১৭৫৭ সালের ফুকো বর্ণিত সেই ব্রুটালিটিও এই ছবিতে নেই। বরং এই ছবিকে এনলাইটমেন্টে আসার আগ মুহূর্তের ডিসিপ্লিন শিক্ষার ড্রেস রিহার্সালও বলা যেতে পারে। যেখানে রাজার ছেলেকেও অপরাধের কারণে শাস্তি পেতে হচ্ছে। কিন্তু সে নায়ক। তাঁকে মারার ক্ষমতা কারো নেই। এই জেল-জুলুম অনেক বেশি রোমান্টিক ধ্যানধারণায় আক্রান্ত। আর জেমসের ‘জেল থেকে বলছি’ ফুকোর আধুনিক কারাগারের বর্ণনার সঙ্গে সাদৃশ্যপূর্ণ এবং অনেক বেশি সমসাময়িক। গায়কের কণ্ঠেই বোঝা যায় এই শাস্তি অফেরতযোগ্য। যা তাঁকে পেতেই হবে এবং সেটা নিয়ন্ত্রণ করছে অন্য কেউ। শেষ পর্যন্ত এই গানের চরিত্র কিংবা জেমস আসলে সেই নায়ক যাঁর নায়ক হয়ে ওঠার ক্ষমতা নেই। জেরেমি বেনথামের প্যানোপটিকন থিওরির চৌকিদারের বরং এখানে নায়ক হয়ে ওঠার সম্ভাবনা অনেক বেশি। ৫ জেমসের গানটি মূলত সেই সময়ের ভয়াবহ নৈরাজ্যের স্মারক। যার মেজাজ বন্দি কারাগারের মিথের চেয়ে আলাদা। তবে বাংলা ছবি মাত্রই ভালোর জয় এবং দুষ্টের পতন। সেই অর্থে ‘বন্দি কারাগারকেও’ আপনি চাইলে একদিক থেকে ‘জেল থেকে বলছি’র মতো করে সিম্বোলাইজ করতে পারবেন। কারণ শেষ পর্যন্ত স্বৈরাচারী এরশাদ সরকারের পতন হয়েছিল এবং রাজকুমার আনোয়ার নির্দোষ প্রমাণিত হয়েছিলেন। তবে তারপরও একটা বড় প্রশ্ন থেকেই যায়, তা হলো, এতকিছুর পর ‘জেল থেকে বলছি’র সেই চরিত্রের জেল থেকে মুক্তি মিলেছে কি না? আধুনিক রাষ্ট্রব্যবস্থায় ব্যক্তির মুক্তি কিংবা শাস্তির মধ্যদিয়ে জেল-জুলুমের সিলসিলা শেষ হয়ে যায় না। সেদিক থেকে হয়তো সে চরিত্র এখনো কারাগারে মৃত্যুর জন্য অপেক্ষমাণ। অনেক আগে তার মৃত্যু ঘটার পরও। ৬ আরেকটি গুরুত্বপূর্ণ দিক হলো দুই গানের ভাষা এবং উপাদান। জেমসের গান প্রেমিকাকে উদ্দেশ্য করে একেবারে টনটনে প্রমিত ভাষায়। যেখানে প্রেমিকার চুলের মৃদু গন্ধের কথা মনে করছে নায়ক। অন্যদিকে মুজিব পরদেশীর ‘বন্দি কারাগারে’ মূলত মাকে উদ্দেশ্য করে। সেই সঙ্গে এই গানের কথায় এমন সব উপাদান এসেছে, যা আবার ‘জেল থেকে বলছি’র চরিত্র থেকে সম্পূর্ণ আলাদা। যদিও প্রমিত এবং আঞ্চলিক মিলিয়ে মিশিয়ে এই গানটি তৈরি। তবে এই গানের লিরিকের কিছু অংশ মধ্যবিত্ত রুচি থেকে অনেক দূরে অবস্থান করছে। ‘দুইটি রুটি দেয় রুটি খেয়ে পেট ভরে না’ কিংবা ‘প্রাণে যে মানে না মশার কামড়ে ঘুম ধরে না’ এই কথাগুলো শিবলীর কাছ থেকে অপ্রতাশ্যিত। মূলত নিজের শ্রেণিগত অবস্থানের কারণে শিবলী এ ধরনের লিরিক লিখবেন না বা লিখতে পারবেন না। কারণ তাঁর টার্গেট অডিয়েন্স বা যে শ্রেণির জন্য তিনি গান লিখছেন তাঁরা এ ধরনের লিরিকের জন্য প্রস্তুত থাকেন না। অন্যদিকে ঠিক একই কারণে মুজিব পরদেশী ‘জেল থেকে বলছি’র মতো লিরিকের সঙ্গে নিজেকে যুক্ত করতে পারবেন না। এখানে শ্রেণি একটা বিশাল দেয়াল হয়ে দাঁড়িয়ে আছে। তবে কোনো কোনো ক্ষেত্রে নিজ নিজ শ্রেণির গণ্ডি পেরিয়ে যেতে পেরেছে দুটি গানই। যার ফলে এখনো একইভাবে বাংলা গানের ধারায় নিজেদের অবস্থান জারি রাখতে পারছে। পাঠকের পছন্দ দাওয়াতে গেলে কী করবেন, কী করবেন না শরীরে পানির ঘাটতি, বুঝুন ৪ লক্ষণে কোঁকড়া চুলের যত্নে তিন তরিকা অ ফ A সাহিত্যে নোবেল: ‘ফেলোশিপ’ সম্মাননা পেলেন শীর্ষেন্দু মুখোপাধ্যায় সিরাজুল ইসলাম চৌধুরীর জন্মদিন উপলক্ষ্যে ‘আজ ও আগামীকাল’ বইয়ের মোড়ক উন্মোচন ‘কনসার্ট ফর বাংলাদেশ : দুই বন্ধু এক দেশ’ বইয়ের আলোচনা আমিই নজরুলের আয়োজনে ‘নজরুল সন্ধ্যা’ বুকার পুরস্কার জিতলেন ভারতের গীতাঞ্জলি সর্বস্তরে নজরুলের চেতনা ছড়িয়ে দেওয়ার আহ্বান × LIVE ×", ""]}, {"title": "Introduction", "content": "বেদের মেয়ে জোসনা' হল তোজাম্মেল হক বকুল পরিচালিত ১৯৮৯ সালের বাংলাদেশী চলচ্চিত্র। এতে নাম ভূমিকায় অভিনয় করেন অঞ্জু ঘোষ এবং তার বিপরীতে কেন্দ্রীয় চরিত্রে অভিনয় করেন ইলিয়াস কাঞ্চন। এটি বাংলাদেশের চলচ্চিত্র ইতিহাসের সর্বোচ্চ ব্যবসাসফল ছায়াছবি। চলচ্চিত্রটির সফলতার ধারাবাহিকতায় ভারতের পশ্চিমবঙ্গেও পুননির্মাণ করে মুক্তি দেওয়া হয়। মূল ভূমিকায় অভিনয় করেন অঞ্জু ঘোষ এবং চিরঞ্জীত।", "references": [""]}]}

(রাজ্জাক), বড়বোন রওশন জামিল এবং বোনের স্বামী খান আতাউর রহমান। বড়বোন রওশন জামিল বিবাহিত।  তিনি থাকেন বাবার বাসাতেই। তার স্বামী অত্যন্ত নিরীহ প্রকৃতির। সংসারের সব ক্ষমতা রওশন জামিলেরই হস্তগত। এই ক্ষমতার অপব্যবহার করেই তিনি তার স্বামীসহ নিজের দুই ভাইদের উপর একরকম স্বৈরশাসন চালিয়ে থাকেন। আঁচলে চাবির গোছা নিয়ে ঘোরেন তিনি। পেছনে পেছনে পানের বাটা নিয়ে ঘোরে বাড়ির গৃহ পরিচারিকা। তার দোর্দণ্ড প্রতাপে অস্থির সবাই। তৎকালীন পাকিস্তানি স্বৈরশাসকদেরই মূলত রূপক আকারে ফুটিয়ে তোলা হয়েছে এ চরিত্রটিতে।\nরওশন জামিলের স্বামী খান আতাউর রহমান আদালতের কর্মচারী হিসেবে কাজ করেন। খান আতাউর রহমান তার এক বন্ধুর পরামর্শে তার শালা শওকত আকবরের বিয়ে ঠিক করেন। পাত্রী সাথী (রোজী সামাদ) নামের এক শান্ত শিষ্ট মেয়ে। কিন্তু রওশন জামিল সম্পূর্ণ বেঁকে বসলেন। তিনি তার ভাইয়ের বিয়ে দিতে একদমই নারাজ। তিনি ভয় পাচ্ছিলেন যে সংসারের চাবি না আবার তার হাত ফস্কে নতুন বউয়ের হাতে উঠে যায়। ফলশ্রুতিতে রওশন জামিলকে না জানিয়েই তার ভাইয়ের বিয়ে দিয়ে দেন খান আতাউর রহমান।\nসাথী বউ হয়ে ঘরে আসলে তার উপর রওশন জামিলের অত্যাচারের খড়গ নেমে আসে। অপর দিকে সাথীর ছোট বোন বীথির (সুচন্দা) প্রেমে পড়ে যান ফারুক ওরফে রাজ্জাক । দুলাভাই আর বড় ভাই অনুমতি দিলে বীথিকে বিয়ে করে ফেলেন তিনিও। সাথী এবং বীথির বড় ভাই আনোয়ার হোসেন। আনোয়ার হোসেন ছিলেন রাজনৈতিক আন্দোলনের কর্মী। স্বাধিকারের আন্দোলনে তিনি কারারুদ্ধ হন।\nঅন্যদিকে সাথী তথা সুচন্দার নেতৃত্বে বাড়ির সবাই ঐক্যবদ্ধ হয়ে যায়। নিজেদের বাড়ির ভেতরেই দেয়ালে দেয়ালে পোস্টার লাগানো হয়। রওশন জামিলের চাবির গোছা চলে আসে দুই বোনের কাছে। পানের বাটা ঘুরতে থাকে তাদের পেছনে পেছনে। ক্ষমতা হারিয়ে পাগলের মত হয়ে যান রওশন জামিল। নতুন নতুন ষড়যন্ত্র করতে শুরু করেন। এরই মাঝে সাথী ও বীথি সন্তানসম্ভবা হয়ে পড়লে তাদের হাসপাতালে ভর্তি করানো হয়।\nদুর্ভাগ্যক্রমে মৃত সন্তান জন্ম দেয় সাথী। ডাক্তার আশঙ্কা প্রকাশ করেন যে এ শোক হয়তবা সাথী সহ্য করতে পারবে না। তাই বীথির সন্তানকে তুলে দেয়া হয় তার কোলে। নিজের সন্তান ভেবে তাকে লালন পালন করতে শুরু করে সাথী। রওশন জামিল ষড়যন্ত্র করে  দুই বোনের মাঝে বিবাদ বাঁধিয়ে দেয়। কৌশলে বীথিকে বিষ খাওয়ান তিনি আর সেই দোষ চাপান সাথীর উপর। বীথি সুস্থ হয়ে বেঁচে উঠলেও বিষ খাওয়ানোর অভিযোগে গ্রেপ্তার হয় সাথী। আদালতে মামলা উঠলে নিজের স্ত্রীকে দোষী মনে করে শওকত আকবর তার বিরুদ্ধে মামলা লড়েন, আর সাথীর পক্ষের উকিল হন খান আতাউর রহমান। খান আতাউর রহমান আদালতে প্রমাণ করে দেন যে তার নিজের স্ত্রী রওশন জামিলই আসলে বিষ প্রয়োগের মূল হোতা। এভাবেই সিনেমার কাহিনী শেষ হয়।", "references": []}, {"title": "সংগীত", "content": "জীবন থেকে নেয়া ছবির সংগীত

রাষ্ট্রের গল্প। তেমনই একটি চলচ্চিত্র ১৯৭০ সালে নির্মিত জহির রায়হান পরিচালিত ‘জীবন থেকে নেয়া’। একটি পরাধীন দেশ কিভাবে স্বাধীনতা আন্দোলনের দিকে ধীরে ধীরে এগিয়ে যায়- এটি সেই গল্প। সবচেয়ে গুরুত্বপূর্ণ বিষয় হলো ছবিটি নির্মিত হয়েছে পরাধীন সময়ে। ১৯৫২ সালের ভাষা আন্দোলনে যে কজন তরুন প্রত্যক্ষভাবে অংশগ্রহণ করে কারাবরন করেছিলেন- জহির রায়হান তাদের একজন। সেই আন্দোলনকে নিয়ে লিখেছিলেন ‘পোস্টার’ নামে একটি গল্প ও ‘আরেক ফাগুন’ নামের উপন্যাস। ইচ্ছে ছিল ‘একুশে ফেব্রুয়ারি’ নামে ছবি নির্মাণের। সে ছবির জন্য একটি পোস্টারও ডিজাইন করেছিলেন। কিন্তু সরকারের বাধার কারণে তা হতে পারেনি। ১৯৬৯-৭০ সালের দিকে বিহারী প্রযোজক আনিস দোসানি জহির রয়হানকে একটি ছবি বানাতে বললেন। জহির কাহিনি ও চিত্রনাট্যের জন্য ডাকলেন আমজাদ হোসেনকে। জহির জানালেন, ‘এমন একটা গল্প হবে যেখানে এক বোন আরেক বোনকে বিষ খাওয়াবে।’ আমজাদ বললেন, ‘বোন বোনকে বিষ খাওয়াবে! দর্শক কি ব্যপারটা গ্রহণ করবে?’ আমজাদ লিখে ফেললেন প্রথম দৃশ্য। কিন্তু অন্যরকম, এক বোন আরেক বোনকে দুধ-ভাই খাওয়াচ্ছে। কিছুক্ষণ পর ফিরে এসে জহির স্ক্রিপ্ট দেখলেন। দেখেই বললেন, ‘খাওয়াতে বললাম বিষ! আর খাওয়াচ্ছেন দুধ!’ আমজাদ হেসে বলেন, ‘দুধ না খাওয়ালে বিষ খাওয়াবো কিভাবে!’ এরপর আমজাদ যেভাবেই লেখেন না কেন, তা পারিবারিক গল্প থেকে রাজনৈতিক গল্পে চলে যাচ্ছিল। এখানেও আছে আরেকটা গল্প আছে। এর আগে গণঅভ্যুত্থানে আসাদ শহীদ হবার কিছুদিন পর মওলানা ভাসানী তার দলীয় কর্মী আমজাদ হোসেনকে ডেকে আসাদকে নিয়ে একটা ডকুমেন্টারি নির্মাণের জন্য বলেন। কিন্তু সরকারি চাপে আসাদের পরিবারের অনুরোধে সে কাজটি বন্ধ হয়ে যায়। ফলে তিনি জীবন থেকে নেয়ার স্ক্রিপ্ট লিখতে বসে বারবার রাজনীতির গল্পে ঢুকে যাচ্ছিলেন। এক সময় জহির দেখলেন নিজের ইচ্ছেও গল্পটায় ঢুকে পড়ছে। এরপর দুজন মিলে স্ক্রিপ্ট শেষ করলেন। প্রথমে চলচ্চিত্রটির নাম ঠিক করা হয় ‘তিনজন মেয়ে ও এক পেয়ালা বিষ’। কিন্তু লেখার মাঝামাঝি অবস্থায় একদিন জহির রায়হান নাম পাল্টে রাখলেন ‘জীবন থেকে নেয়া’। ছবির কাহিনি দজ্জাল বড় বোন রওশন জামিল, স্বামী খান আতাউর রহমান, দুই ভাই শওকত আকবর ও রাজ্জাক,দুই ভাইয়ের বউ রোজী ও সুচন্দা এবং বাড়ীর চাকর বাকর ও রোজী –সুচন্দার বড় ভাই রাজনীতিবিদ আনোয়ার হোসেনকে ঘিরে। পুরো বাড়িতে দজ্জাল বড় বোন রওশন জামিলের একচ্ছত্র আধিপত্য চলতে থাকা অবস্থায় দুই ভাই বিয়ে করে নববধুদের সংসারে প্রবেশ এবং পরবর্তীতে সংসারের চাবির ঘোছা নিজের নিয়ন্ত্রনে রাখার কূটকৌশল চরমে পৌঁছে। ছবির চরিত্র বিশ্লেষনে দেখা যায় রওশন জামিলের চরিত্রটি তৎকালীন স্বৈরশাসক ও একনায়কতন্ত্রের (আইয়ুব খান/ ইয়াহিয়া খান) মুখচ্ছবি। যারা জোর করে বারবার এ দেশের মানুষের গণতান্ত্রিক অধিকারকে দাবিয়ে রাখার চেষ্টা করছিল। আনোয়ার হোসেন সে সময়ের জনপ্রিয় ও সচেতন দেশপ্রেমিক রাজনৈতিক নেতা ও রাজ্জাক প্রতিবাদী ছাত্র আন্দোলনের প্রতীক। ছবির শেষে দেখা যায় এক নবজাতককে। যার নাম মুক্তি। এ যেন পরাধীন বাংলার স্বাধীনতার ঘোষণা। এর বছর দশেক পরে সত্যজিত রায় নির্যাতনকারী ক্ষমতাসীন সরকারকে ব্যাঙ্গ করে নির্মাণ করেছিলেন রূপকধর্মী ছবি ‘হীরক রাজার দেশে’। ছবির একটি অনবদ্য দৃশ্য হল একুশে ফেব্রুয়ারির প্রভাতফেরীতে শহীদ মিনারে ফুল দেয়ার দৃশ্য। বাস্তব সেই দৃশ্য ১৯৭০ সালের ২১ ফেব্রুয়ারি থেকে নেওয়া। চিত্রগ্রাহক আফজাল চৌধুরীর প্রধান সহকারী অরুণ রায় উঁচু থেকে প্রভাতফেরীর শর্ট নিচ্ছিলেন। আর সহকারী তমাল (কবি জসিমউদ্দীনের ছেলে) নিচ্ছিলেন দূর থেকে যেসব দল এগিয়ে আসছিল শহীদ বেদীর দিকে তার ফুটেজ। এদিকে আফজাল চৌধুরী নিজে ধারণ করছিলেন শহীদ বেদীতে আসা দলগুলোর নগ্ন পায়ে আসা এবং ফুল দেয়ার দৃশ্য। প্রভাত ফেরির একটি দৃশ্যে অবশ্য জহির রায়হান নিজেই উপস্থিত ছিলেন। হঠাৎ জহির ছুটে গেলেন আফজালের কাছে। গিয়ে বলেন, ‘আমাকে একটু দেখিয়ে দিন তো কিভাবে ক্যামেরায় শ্যুট করতে হয়! আমি নিজে ধারণ করবো।’ তখন আফজাল তাকে শট নিয়ে সংক্ষিপ্ত ধারণা দিলেন। আর জহির মনের আনন্দে শুরু করলেন ভিডিও ধারণ। জহির রায়হান নিজেই একজন এডিটর ছিলেন, ফলে মাথায় এডিটিংয়ের ভাবনা রেখে ধারণ করলেন বেশ কিছু দৃশ্য। এই ছবি শুটিংকালেই সরকারি নজরদারিতে পড়ে। শুটিংয়ের চলাকালে একদিন এফডিসির ২নং ফোরে আর্মি এসে শুটিং বন্ধ করে দেয়। সকাল দশটায় জিজ্ঞাসাবাদের জন্য ধরে নিয়ে গেলেন জহির রায়হান এবং রাজ্জাককে। বিকেল চারটায় ফিরে এলেন তারা। আসার আগে জহির রায়হান বন্ড দিয়ে এলেন, যদি এই চলচ্চিত্রটি মুক্তি পাবার পর দেশের আইন শৃংখলা পরিস্থিতির অবনতি ঘটে তবে তার সব দায়ভার তিনি বহন করবেন। শুটিং হলো সাভার, এফডিসি এবং জহির রায়হানের বাড়ির ছাদে। চলচ্চিত্রটি মুক্তি পেল ১০ এপ্রিল ১৯৭০। ব্রিগেডিয়ার রাও ফরমান আলী ও মেজর মালেক এবং তাদের দোসররা সেন্সর ছাড়পত্র না দেয়ার চক্রান্তে লিপ্ত হয়। কারণ তারা বুঝতে পারেন রওশন জামিলের চরিত্রটি একটি স্বৈরাচারের চরিত্র। দেশপ্রেমিক সচেতন দর্শক আগেই তাদের খায়েশ জানতে পেরে মিছিল শুরু করে দেয়। সামরিক সরকার বাধ্য হয় ছবিটি মুক্তি দিতে। কিন্তু মুক্তির প্রথম দিনই সারাদেশে হৈচৈ পড়ে গেল। প্রথম দিনই নিষিদ্ধ হলো প্রদর্শনী। সব সিনেমা হল থেকে আর্মি জব্দ করে নিয়ে গেল সিনেমার রিল। ঢাকার গুলিস্তান হলের সামনে শুরু হলো বিক্ষোভ। পরদিন সেন্সর বোর্ড আবার বসবে সিনেমাটি দেখতে। সাথে থাকবে রাও ফরমান নিজে। জহির অনেক ভেবে একজনের কথাই স্মরণে আনতে পারলেন, যিনি পারেন ছবিটিকে আবার আলোর মুখ দেখাতে। জহির আমজাদ হোসেনকে দায়িত্বটা দিলেন। কারণ তার এলাকার মানুষ তিনি। আমজাদ গেলেন সেন্সর বোর্ডের সদস্য নাট্যকার আসকার ইবনে শাইখের কাছে। আমজাদ তার হাটুর কাছে বসে পা টিপতে টিপতে বললেন, ‘স্যার আপনার উপরে সবকিছু। আপনি প্লিজ কালকে যাবেন।’ উনি বললেন, ‘আমি অসুস্থ। হাই প্রেসার তাই যেতে পারবো না।’ আমজাদ কাঁদো কাঁদো কন্ঠে বললেন, ‘স্যার সারাদেশ আপনার দিকে তাকিয়ে।’ পরদিন শাইখ সাহেব গেলেন সেন্সর বোর্ডে। বোর্ডে উপস্থিত অল পাকিস্তান সেন্সর মেম্বার। আমজাদ প্রজেকশন রুমে চুরি করে অবস্থান নিয়ে প্রজেকশনের ছোট ছিদ্র দিয়ে তাকিয়ে রইলেন। রাও ফরমানসহ বাকি সদস্যরা ছবিটি দেখলেন। ছবি শেষে চেয়ারম্যান সাহেব সবার মুখের দিকে তাকিয়ে কি মনে করে আসকার ইবনে শাইখকে বললেন, ‘আপনি বলেন।’ তিনি, কিছুক্ষণ চুপ থেকে তারপর দাঁড়িয়ে বললেন, ‘স্যার পবিত্র কোরআনে কোন মিথ্যে কথা বলা নেই। মিথ্যে কথা বলবার কোন সুযোগও সেখানে দেয়া হয়নি। জহির হয়ত ভুল করে একটা সত্য সিনেমা বানিয়ে ফেলেছে। এই সত্যকে আমি কিভাবে মিথ্যা বলি!’ কেউ আর কোন কথা বলল না। ছবিটি মুক্তি পেল। তবে প্রজেকশন শেষে রাও ফরমান জহিরকে বললেন, ‘ছবিটি ছেড়ে দিলাম। বাট আই উইল সি ইউ।’ এই চলচ্চিত্রের সংগীত পরিচালক ছিলেন খান আতাউর রহমান। তিনি রবীন্দ্রনাথ ঠাকুরের ‘আমার সোনার বাংলা’ গানটিকে আধুনিক যন্ত্রপাতির মাধ্যমে কম্পোজিশন করলেন। এর মাধ্যমে উপমহাদেশে প্রথমবারের মতো রবীন্দ্র সংগীতে আধুনিক যন্ত্রপাতি ব্যবহৃত হয় এই গানটির মাধ্যমে। অন্যদিকে স্বাধীনতার আগে এটিই ছিল এই গানের প্রথম আনুষ্ঠানিক ব্যবহার। একইভাবে কাজী নজরুল ইসলামের ‘কারার ঐ লৌহকপাট’, ‘আমার ভাইয়ের রক্তে রাঙানো’সহ একটি বাদে (এ খাঁচা ভাঙ্গব আমি কেমন করে) প্রায় সবগুলো গানেই তিনি করেন আধুনিক বাদ্যযন্ত্রের কম্পোজিশন। এখানে আজ আমরা ‘আমার ভাইয়ের রক্তে রাঙানো’ শিরোনামে যে গানটি শুনি এটা কিন্তু ‘জীবন থেকে নেয়া’ চলচ্চিত্রে খান আতার দেয়া সেই কম্পোজিশনটাই শুনি। গানটি এর আগে একই সুরে গাওয়া হলেও খান আতা সিনেমার জন্য এতে হামিংসহ আরো কিছু আবেগমাখা শ্রুতিমধুরতা যুক্ত করেন। মুক্তিযুদ্ধের সময় ছবিটি কলকাতার হলে রেকর্ড ব্যবসা করে। জহির অবাক হয়ে দেখেন ছবিটি দারুন ব্যবসা করছে। কিন্তু এখান থেকে একটা টাকাও জহির নিজে খরচ করেননি। পুরোটাই তুলে দেন মুক্তিযুদ্ধের ফান্ডে। সহকারী অরুণ রায় পরবর্তীতে তার চীফ আফজাল চৌধুরীকে বলেছিলেন, ‘সেদিন পকেটে খাবার পয়সা ছিল না, অথচ জহির ভাই সবগুলো টাকা মুক্তিযুদ্ধের ফান্ডে জমা দিয়ে দেন।’ কিন্তু তারাই জহিরকে নিয়ে নানা চক্রান্ত শুরু করেছিল। যেটা শুরু হয়েছিল প্রামণ্যচিত্র ‘স্টপ জেনোসাইড’ তৈরি করার সময়। জহির রায়হান ও ‘জীবন থেকে নেয়া’ নিয়ে আজো আমরা বড় বড় অনেক কথা বলি। রাজনীতি-চলচ্চিত্রের সম্পর্কে ছবিটি অনেক গুরুত্বপূর্ণ। কিন্তু প্রশ্ন হলো ক্ষমতাসীনদের অন্যায়-অবিচার নিয়ে এমন ছবি বানানো এখন কি সম্ভব? এই প্রশ্নের উত্তর পাঠকরাই দিক। জীবন থেকে নেয়া (১৯৭০)

হয়ে উঠতে পারে একটি রাষ্ট্রের গল্প। তেমনই একটি চলচ্চিত্র ১৯৭০ সালে নির্মিত জহির রায়হান পরিচালিত ‘জীবন থেকে নেয়া’। একটি পরাধীন দেশ কিভাবে স্বাধীনতা আন্দোলনের দিকে ধীরে ধীরে এগিয়ে যায়- এটি সেই গল্প। সবচেয়ে গুরুত্বপূর্ণ বিষয় হলো ছবিটি নির্মিত হয়েছে পরাধীন সময়ে। ১৯৫২ সালের ভাষা আন্দোলনে যে কজন তরুন প্রত্যক্ষভাবে অংশগ্রহণ করে কারাবরন করেছিলেন- জহির রায়হান তাদের একজন। সেই আন্দোলনকে নিয়ে লিখেছিলেন ‘পোস্টার’ নামে একটি গল্প ও ‘আরেক ফাগুন’ নামের উপন্যাস। ইচ্ছে ছিল ‘একুশে ফেব্রুয়ারি’ নামে ছবি নির্মাণের। সে ছবির জন্য একটি পোস্টারও ডিজাইন করেছিলেন। কিন্তু সরকারের বাধার কারণে তা হতে পারেনি। ১৯৬৯-৭০ সালের দিকে বিহারী প্রযোজক আনিস দোসানি জহির রয়হানকে একটি ছবি বানাতে বললেন। জহির কাহিনি ও চিত্রনাট্যের জন্য ডাকলেন আমজাদ হোসেনকে। জহির জানালেন, ‘এমন একটা গল্প হবে যেখানে এক বোন আরেক বোনকে বিষ খাওয়াবে।’ আমজাদ বললেন, ‘বোন বোনকে বিষ খাওয়াবে! দর্শক কি ব্যপারটা গ্রহণ করবে?’ আমজাদ লিখে ফেললেন প্রথম দৃশ্য। কিন্তু অন্যরকম, এক বোন আরেক বোনকে দুধ-ভাই খাওয়াচ্ছে। কিছুক্ষণ পর ফিরে এসে জহির স্ক্রিপ্ট দেখলেন। দেখেই বললেন, ‘খাওয়াতে বললাম বিষ! আর খাওয়াচ্ছেন দুধ!’ আমজাদ হেসে বলেন, ‘দুধ না খাওয়ালে বিষ খাওয়াবো কিভাবে!’ এরপর আমজাদ যেভাবেই লেখেন না কেন, তা পারিবারিক গল্প থেকে রাজনৈতিক গল্পে চলে যাচ্ছিল। এখানেও আছে আরেকটা গল্প আছে। এর আগে গণঅভ্যুত্থানে আসাদ শহীদ হবার কিছুদিন পর মওলানা ভাসানী তার দলীয় কর্মী আমজাদ হোসেনকে ডেকে আসাদকে নিয়ে একটা ডকুমেন্টারি নির্মাণের জন্য বলেন। কিন্তু সরকারি চাপে আসাদের পরিবারের অনুরোধে সে কাজটি বন্ধ হয়ে যায়। ফলে তিনি জীবন থেকে নেয়ার স্ক্রিপ্ট লিখতে বসে বারবার রাজনীতির গল্পে ঢুকে যাচ্ছিলেন। এক সময় জহির দেখলেন নিজের ইচ্ছেও গল্পটায় ঢুকে পড়ছে। এরপর দুজন মিলে স্ক্রিপ্ট শেষ করলেন। প্রথমে চলচ্চিত্রটির নাম ঠিক করা হয় ‘তিনজন মেয়ে ও এক পেয়ালা বিষ’। কিন্তু লেখার মাঝামাঝি অবস্থায় একদিন জহির রায়হান নাম পাল্টে রাখলেন ‘জীবন থেকে নেয়া’।এরকম আরো পড়ুন :স্বাধীনতার পাঁচ দশকে বাংলাদেশের চলচ্চিত্রের উত্থান-পতনবাংলা সিনেমার পোস্টারের ইতিহাসজনগণ নন্দিতা বিউটি কুইন শাবানাউর্দু সিনেমায় বাঙালিদের অবদান যেভাবে ভুলে গেছে পাকিস্তান ছবির কাহিনি দজ্জাল বড় বোন রওশন জামিল, স্বামী খান আতাউর রহমান, দুই ভাই শওকত আকবর ও রাজ্জাক,দুই ভাইয়ের বউ রোজী ও সুচন্দা এবং বাড়ীর চাকর বাকর ও রোজী –সুচন্দার বড় ভাই রাজনীতিবিদ আনোয়ার হোসেনকে ঘিরে। পুরো বাড়িতে দজ্জাল বড় বোন রওশন জামিলের একচ্ছত্র আধিপত্য চলতে থাকা

একনায়কতন্ত্রের (আইয়ুব খান/ ইয়াহিয়া খান) মুখচ্ছবি। যারা জোর করে বারবার এ দেশের মানুষের গণতান্ত্রিক অধিকারকে দাবিয়ে রাখার চেষ্টা করছিল। আনোয়ার হোসেন সে সময়ের জনপ্রিয় ও সচেতন দেশপ্রেমিক রাজনৈতিক নেতা ও রাজ্জাক প্রতিবাদী ছাত্র আন্দোলনের প্রতীক। ছবির শেষে দেখা যায় এক নবজাতককে। যার নাম মুক্তি। এ যেন পরাধীন বাংলার স্বাধীনতার ঘোষণা। এর বছর দশেক পরে সত্যজিত রায় নির্যাতনকারী ক্ষমতাসীন সরকারকে ব্যাঙ্গ করে নির্মাণ করেছিলেন রূপকধর্মী ছবি ‘হীরক রাজার দেশে’। ছবির একটি অনবদ্য দৃশ্য হল একুশে ফেব্রুয়ারির প্রভাতফেরীতে শহীদ মিনারে ফুল দেয়ার দৃশ্য। বাস্তব সেই দৃশ্য ১৯৭০ সালের ২১ ফেব্রুয়ারি থেকে নেওয়া। চিত্রগ্রাহক আফজাল চৌধুরীর প্রধান সহকারী অরুণ রায় উঁচু থেকে প্রভাতফেরীর শর্ট নিচ্ছিলেন। আর সহকারী তমাল (কবি জসিমউদ্দীনের ছেলে) নিচ্ছিলেন দূর থেকে যেসব দল এগিয়ে আসছিল শহীদ বেদীর দিকে তার ফুটেজ। এদিকে আফজাল চৌধুরী নিজে ধারণ করছিলেন শহীদ বেদীতে আসা দলগুলোর নগ্ন পায়ে আসা এবং ফুল দেয়ার দৃশ্য। প্রভাত ফেরির একটি দৃশ্যে অবশ্য জহির রায়হান নিজেই উপস্থিত ছিলেন। হঠাৎ জহির ছুটে গেলেন আফজালের কাছে। গিয়ে বলেন, ‘আমাকে একটু দেখিয়ে দিন তো কিভাবে ক্যামেরায় শ্যুট করতে হয়! আমি নিজে ধারণ করবো।’ তখন আফজাল তাকে শট নিয়ে সংক্ষিপ্ত ধারণা দিলেন। আর জহির মনের আনন্দে শুরু করলেন ভিডিও ধারণ। জহির রায়হান নিজেই একজন এডিটর ছিলেন, ফলে মাথায় এডিটিংয়ের ভাবনা রেখে ধারণ করলেন বেশ কিছু দৃশ্য। এই ছবি শুটিংকালেই সরকারি নজরদারিতে পড়ে। শুটিংয়ের চলাকালে একদিন এফডিসির ২নং ফোরে আর্মি এসে শুটিং বন্ধ করে দেয়। সকাল দশটায় জিজ্ঞাসাবাদের জন্য ধরে নিয়ে গেলেন জহির রায়হান এবং রাজ্জাককে। বিকেল চারটায় ফিরে এলেন তারা। আসার আগে জহির রায়হান বন্ড দিয়ে এলেন, যদি এই চলচ্চিত্রটি মুক্তি পাবার পর দেশের আইন শৃংখলা পরিস্থিতির অবনতি ঘটে তবে তার সব দায়ভার তিনি বহন করবেন। শুটিং হলো সাভার, এফডিসি এবং জহির রায়হানের বাড়ির ছাদে। চলচ্চিত্রটি মুক্তি পেল ১০ এপ্রিল ১৯৭০। ব্রিগেডিয়ার রাও ফরমান আলী ও মেজর মালেক এবং তাদের দোসররা সেন্সর ছাড়পত্র না দেয়ার চক্রান্তে লিপ্ত হয়। কারণ তারা বুঝতে পারেন রওশন জামিলের চরিত্রটি একটি স্বৈরাচারের চরিত্র। দেশপ্রেমিক সচেতন দর্শক আগেই তাদের খায়েশ জানতে পেরে মিছিল শুরু করে দেয়। সামরিক সরকার বাধ্য হয় ছবিটি মুক্তি দিতে। কিন্তু মুক্তির প্রথম দিনই সারাদেশে হৈচৈ পড়ে গেল। প্রথম দিনই নিষিদ্ধ হলো প্রদর্শনী। সব সিনেমা হল থেকে আর্মি জব্দ করে নিয়ে গেল সিনেমার রিল। ঢাকার গুলিস্তান হলের সামনে শুরু হলো বিক্ষোভ। পরদিন সেন্সর বোর্ড আবার বসবে সিনেমাটি দেখতে। সাথে থাকবে রাও ফরমান নিজে। জহির অনেক ভেবে একজনের কথাই স্মরণে আনতে পারলেন, যিনি পারেন ছবিটিকে আবার আলোর মুখ দেখাতে। জহির আমজাদ হোসেনকে দায়িত্বটা দিলেন। কারণ তার এলাকার মানুষ তিনি। আমজাদ গেলেন সেন্সর বোর্ডের সদস্য নাট্যকার আসকার ইবনে শাইখের কাছে। আমজাদ তার হাটুর কাছে বসে পা টিপতে টিপতে বললেন, ‘স্যার আপনার উপরে সবকিছু। আপনি প্লিজ কালকে যাবেন।’ উনি বললেন, ‘আমি অসুস্থ। হাই প্রেসার তাই যেতে পারবো না।’ আমজাদ কাঁদো কাঁদো কন্ঠে বললেন, ‘স্যার সারাদেশ আপনার দিকে তাকিয়ে।’ পরদিন শাইখ সাহেব গেলেন সেন্সর বোর্ডে। বোর্ডে উপস্থিত অল পাকিস্তান সেন্সর মেম্বার। আমজাদ প্রজেকশন রুমে চুরি করে অবস্থান নিয়ে প্রজেকশনের ছোট ছিদ্র দিয়ে তাকিয়ে রইলেন। রাও ফরমানসহ বাকি সদস্যরা ছবিটি দেখলেন। ছবি শেষে চেয়ারম্যান সাহেব সবার মুখের দিকে তাকিয়ে কি মনে করে আসকার ইবনে শাইখকে বললেন, ‘আপনি বলেন।’ তিনি, কিছুক্ষণ চুপ থেকে তারপর দাঁড়িয়ে বললেন, ‘স্যার পবিত্র কোরআনে কোন মিথ্যে কথা বলা নেই। মিথ্যে কথা বলবার কোন সুযোগও সেখানে দেয়া হয়নি। জহির হয়ত ভুল করে একটা সত্য সিনেমা বানিয়ে ফেলেছে। এই সত্যকে আমি কিভাবে মিথ্যা বলি!’ কেউ আর কোন কথা বলল না। ছবিটি মুক্তি পেল। তবে প্রজেকশন শেষে রাও ফরমান জহিরকে বললেন, ‘ছবিটি ছেড়ে দিলাম। বাট আই উইল সি ইউ।’ এই চলচ্চিত্রের সংগীত পরিচালক ছিলেন খান আতাউর রহমান। তিনি রবীন্দ্রনাথ ঠাকুরের ‘আমার সোনার বাংলা’ গানটিকে আধুনিক যন্ত্রপাতির মাধ্যমে কম্পোজিশন করলেন। এর মাধ্যমে উপমহাদেশে প্রথমবারের মতো রবীন্দ্র সংগীতে আধুনিক যন্ত্রপাতি ব্যবহৃত হয় এই গানটির মাধ্যমে। অন্যদিকে স্বাধীনতার আগে এটিই ছিল এই গানের প্রথম আনুষ্ঠানিক ব্যবহার। একইভাবে কাজী নজরুল ইসলামের ‘কারার ঐ লৌহকপাট’, ‘আমার ভাইয়ের রক্তে রাঙানো’সহ একটি বাদে (এ খাঁচা ভাঙ্গব আমি কেমন করে) প্রায় সবগুলো গানেই তিনি করেন আধুনিক বাদ্যযন্ত্রের কম্পোজিশন। এখানে আজ আমরা ‘আমার ভাইয়ের রক্তে রাঙানো’ শিরোনামে যে গানটি শুনি এটা কিন্তু ‘জীবন থেকে নেয়া’ চলচ্চিত্রে খান আতার দেয়া সেই কম্পোজিশনটাই শুনি। গানটি এর আগে একই সুরে গাওয়া হলেও খান আতা সিনেমার জন্য এতে হামিংসহ আরো কিছু আবেগমাখা শ্রুতিমধুরতা যুক্ত করেন। মুক্তিযুদ্ধের সময় ছবিটি কলকাতার হলে রেকর্ড ব্যবসা করে। জহির অবাক হয়ে দেখেন ছবিটি দারুন ব্যবসা করছে। কিন্তু এখান থেকে একটা টাকাও জহির নিজে খরচ করেননি। পুরোটাই তুলে দেন মুক্তিযুদ্ধের ফান্ডে। সহকারী অরুণ রায় পরবর্তীতে তার চীফ আফজাল চৌধুরীকে বলেছিলেন, ‘সেদিন পকেটে খাবার পয়সা ছিল না, অথচ জহির ভাই সবগুলো টাকা মুক্তিযুদ্ধের ফান্ডে জমা দিয়ে দেন।’ কিন্তু তারাই জহিরকে নিয়ে নানা চক্রান্ত শুরু করেছিল। যেটা শুরু হয়েছিল প্রামণ্যচিত্র ‘স্টপ জেনোসাইড’ তৈরি করার সময়। জহির রায়হান ও ‘জীবন থেকে নেয়া’ নিয়ে আজো আমরা বড় বড় অনেক কথা বলি। রাজনীতি-চলচ্চিত্রের সম্পর্কে ছবিটি অনেক গুরুত্বপূর্ণ। কিন্তু প্রশ্ন হলো ক্ষমতাসীনদের অন্যায়-অবিচার নিয়ে এমন ছবি বানানো এখন কি সম্ভব? এই প্রশ্নের উত্তর পাঠকরাই দিক। জীবন থেকে নেয়া (১৯৭০)

পরিবারের জীবনযাত্রার কথাই পথের পাঁচালী ছবির মুখ্য বিষয়। অপুর বাবা পুরোহিত হরিহর রায় (কানু বন্দ্যোপাধ্যায়) নিশ্চিন্তিপুরের পৈতৃক ভিটেয় তার নাতিবৃহৎ পরিবার নিয়ে বসবাস করেন। তিনি পেশায় পুরোহিত। আয় সামান্য। লেখাপড়া জানেন। তাই কিছু ভাল যাত্রাপালা লিখে অধিক উপার্জনের স্বপ্ন দেখেন। বাস্তবে তিনি অত্যন্ত ভালমানুষ এবং লাজুক প্রকৃতির লোক। সকলে সহজেই তাকে ঠকিয়ে নেয়। পরিবারের তীব্র অর্থসংকটের সময়েও তিনি তার প্রাপ্য বেতন আদায় করার জন্য নিয়োগকর্তাকে তাগাদা দিতে পারেন না। হরিহরের স্ত্রী সর্বজয়া (করুণা বন্দ্যোপাধ্যায়) তার দুই সন্তান দুর্গা (উমা দাশগুপ্ত) ও অপু এবং হরিহরের দূর সম্পর্কের বিধবা পিসি ইন্দির ঠাকরুণের (চুনীবালা দেবী) দেখাশোনা করেন। দরিদ্রের সংসার বলে নিজের সংসারে বৃদ্ধা ন্যুব্জদেহ ইন্দির ঠাকরুনের ভাগ বসানোটা ভাল চোখে দেখেন না সর্বজয়া। সর্বজয়ার অত্যাচার অসহ্য বোধ হলে ইন্দির মাঝে মাঝে অন্য এক আত্মীয়ের বাড়িতে গিয়ে আশ্রয় নেন। দুর্গা তার ধনী প্রতিবেশীর বাগান থেকে ফলমূল চুরি করে আনে ও ইন্দির ঠাকরুনের সঙ্গে ভাগাভাগি করে খায়। একদিন, সেই প্রুতিবেশীর স্ত্রী এসে দুর্গাকে একটি পুঁতির মালা চুরির দায়ে অভিযুক্ত করেন ও এই চুরির প্রবণতাকে উৎসাহ দেওয়ার অপরাধে সর্বজয়াকে দোষী সাব্যস্ত করেন।\n\nভাইবোন অপু ও দুর্গার মধ্যে খুব ভাব। দুর্গা দিদি। সেও মায়ের মতোই অপুকে ভালবাসে। তবে মাঝেমধ্যে তাকে খেপিয়ে তুলতেও ছাড়ে না। তারা কখনও কখনও চুপচাপ গাছতলায় বসে থাকে, কখনও মিঠাইওয়ালার পিছু পিছু ছোটে, কখনও ভ্রাম্যমাণ বায়োস্কোপ-ওয়ালার বায়োস্কোপ দেখে বা যাত্রাপালা দেখে। সন্ধ্যাবেলা দু'জনে দূরাগত ট্রেনের বাঁশি শুনতে পেয়ে আনন্দ পায়। একদিন তারা বাড়িতে না বলে অনেক দূরে চলে আসে ট্রেন দেখবে বলে। কাশের বনে ট্রেন দেখার জন্য অপু-দুর্গার ছোটাছুটির দৃশ্যটি এই ছবি'র এক স্মরণীয় ক্ষণ। বাড়ি ফিরে এসে তারা ইন্দির ঠাকরুনকে মৃত অবস্থায় দেখতে পায়।\n\nগ্রামে ভাল উপার্জন করতে সক্ষম না হয়ে হরিহর একটা ভাল কাজের আশায় শহরে যান। সর্বজয়াকে তিনি প্রতিশ্রুতি দিয়ে যান যে, ভাল উপার্জন হলে ফিরে এসে ভাঙা বসতবাড়িটা সারিয়ে তুলবেন। হরিহরের অনুপস্থিতিতে তাদের অর্থসংকট তীব্রতর হয়। সর্বজয়া অত্যন্ত একা বোধ করতে থাকেন ও খিটখিটে হয়ে যেতে থাকেন। বর্ষাকালে একদিন দুর্গা অনেকক্ষণ বৃষ্টিতে ভিজে জ্বর বাধায়। ওষুধের অভাবে তার জ্বর বেড়েই চলে ও শেষে সেই ঝড়ের রাতেই দুর্গা মারা যায়। এরপর একদিন হরিহর ফিরে আসেন। শহর থেকে যা কিছু এনেছেন, তা সর্বজয়াকে বের করে দেখাতে থাকেন। সর্বজয়া, প্রথমে চুপ করে থাকেন, পরে স্বামীর পায়ে কান্নায় ভেঙে পড়েন। হরিহর বুঝতে পারেন যে, তিনি তার একমাত্র কন্যাকে হারিয়েছে। তারা গ্রাম ও পৈতৃক ভিটে ছেড়ে অন্য কোথাও চলে যাওয়ার সিদ্ধান্ত নেন। যাত্রার তোড়জোড় শুরু হলে, অপু দুর্গার চুরি করা পুঁতির মালাটা আবিষ্কার করে। সে মালাটা ডোবার জলে ছুঁড়ে ফেলে দেয়। ছবির শেষ দৃশ্যে দেখা যায়, অপু বাবা-মায়ের সঙ্গে গোরুর গাড়িতে চড়ে নতুন এক গন্তব্যের উদ্দেশ্যে চলেছে।",

উপন্যাসটি প্রকাশিত হতে শুরু করে এবং ১৯২৯ খ্রিষ্টাব্দে পুস্তকাকারে প্রকাশিত হয়। উপন্যাসটিতে একটি দরিদ্র পরিবারের নিজের গ্রামের ভিটেতে টিকে থাকার লড়াই এবং সেই পরিবারের ছেলে অপুর বেড়ে ওঠা বর্ণিত হয়েছে। উপন্যাসের পরবর্তী অংশে বাবা-মায়ের সঙ্গে অপুর গ্রাম ছেড়ে যাত্রা ও কাশীবাসের কাহিনী রয়েছে, যা সত্যজিৎ রায়ের অপরাজিত নামক পরবর্তী চলচ্চিত্রে দেখানো হয়েছে। ১৯৪৪ সালে সিগনেট প্রেসের চিত্রলেখ নকশাকার হিসেবে কর্মরত থাকাকালীন, সত্যজিৎ রায় পথের পাঁচালী উপন্যাসটির একটি নতুন অখণ্ড সংস্করণের অলঙ্করণ করার সময় বইটি পড়েন। প্রেসের মালিক ডি. কে. গুপ্ত তাকে বলেন যে এই বইটি থেকে একটি অসাধারণ চলচ্চিত্র নির্মাণ করা সম্ভব। ১৯৪৬-৪৭ সালে সত্যজিৎ যখন চলচ্চিত্র বানানোর কথা চিন্তাভাবনা শুরু করেন, তখন তিনি এই উপন্যাসের মানবতা ও গীতিধর্মিতার প্রভাবে এটিকে চলচ্চিত্র রূপান্তরিত করার সিদ্ধান্ত নেন। লেখকের বিধবা স্ত্রী সত্যজিৎ রায়কে এই উপন্যাস থেকে চলচ্চিত্র নির্মাণের অনুমতি দেন; চুক্তিটি নামেমাত্র ছিল, কোন আর্থিক প্রদান করা হয়নি। চিত্রনাট্য ছবি নির্মাণের জন্য পথের পাঁচালী চলচ্চিত্রের কোন চিত্রনাট্য লেখা হয়নি। সত্যজিৎ রায়ের আঁকা ছবি ও টীকাগুলি থেকে এই চলচ্চিত্র নির্মিত হয়। তিনি ১৯৫০ খ্রিষ্টাব্দে লন্ডনের উদ্দেশ্যে সমুদ্রযাত্রার সময় এই সকল নোটগুলি লেখেন। অপুর পাঁচালী বইতে সত্যজিৎ লিখেছেন যে তিনি চলচ্চিত্রের প্রয়োজনে তিনি উপন্যাসের বেশ কিছু চরিত্রকে সরিয়ে দিয়েছিলেন ও গল্পটিকেও কিছুতা রদবদল করেছিলেন। উপন্যাসের শুরুর দিকেই গ্রামের মন্দিরে সকলের সামনেই ইন্দির ঠাকরুণের মৃত্যু ঘটে, কিন্তু চলচ্চিত্রে অপু ও দুর্গা তার মৃতদেহ পড়ে থাকতে দেখে। চলচ্চিত্রের অপু ও দুর্গার ট্রেন দেখার জন্য দৌড়নোর দৃশ্যটিও উপন্যাসে নেই। বর্ষায় ভিজে প্রচণ্ড জ্বর বাঁধিয়ে দুর্গার মৃত্যু ঘটে বলে চলচ্চিত্রে দেখানো হলেও উপন্যাসে মৃত্যুর কারণ অজানাই রাখা হয়েছে। হরিহর রায়ের পরিবারের গ্রাম ত্যাগ দিয়ে চলচ্চিত্র শেষ হলেও উপন্যাস সেই ভাবে শেষ হয়নি। অভিনয়শিল্পী নির্বাচন পথের পাঁচালী চলচ্চিত্র নির্মাণ হওয়ার আগেই কানু বন্দ্যোপাধ্যায় বাংলা চলচ্চিত্র জগতের একজন প্রতিষ্ঠিত অভিনেতা ছিলেন। সত্যজিতের বন্ধু-পত্নী করুণা বন্দ্যোপাধ্যায় ভারতীয় গণনাট্য সংঘের একজন অপেশাদার অভিনেত্রী ছিলেন। দুর্গার ভূমিকায় অভিনয় করার পূর্বে উমা দাশগুপ্ত কয়েকটি নাটকে অভিনয় করেছিলেন। অপুর চরিত্রে অভিনয় করার জন্য সত্যজিৎ পাঁচ থেকে সাত বছরের শিশুর সন্ধানে সংবাদপত্রে বিজ্ঞাপন দেন, কিন্তু কোন বিজ্ঞাপনের মারফত আসা কোন ছেলেকেই তার পছন্দ হয়নি, কিন্তু সত্যজিতের স্ত্রী বিজয়া রায় তাদের বাড়ির নিকটে সুবীর বন্দ্যোপাধ্যায় নামে একটি ছেলেকে লক্ষ্য করেন এবং অবশেষে অপুর চরিত্রে তাকেই পছন্দ করা হয়। ইন্দির ঠাকরুণের চরিত্রে অভিনয়ের জন্য সত্যজিৎ কলকাতার নিষিদ্ধ পল্লী থেকে চুনীবালা দেবী নামক একজন পুরাতন নাট্যাভিনেত্রীকে খুঁজে বের করেন। অন্যান্য বিভিন্ন অনুল্লেখ্য চরিত্রে বড়াল গ্রামের বাসিন্দারা অভিনয় করেন। দৃশ্যধারণ চলচ্চিত্রটির চিত্রগ্রহণ শুরু হয় ১৯৫২ সালের ২৭শে অক্টোবর। প্রধান চিত্রধারণের জন্য কলকাতার নিকটবর্তী বড়াল গ্রামটিকে নির্বাচন করা হয়েছিল, এবং রাতের দৃশ্যগুলি স্টুডিওতে ধারণ করা হয়েছিল। কলাকুশলীদের মধ্যে কয়েকজন প্রথমবারের মত কাজ করছিলেন, তন্মধ্যে সত্যজিৎ রায় নিজে, এবং চিত্রগ্রাহক সুব্রত মিত্র, যিনি এর পূর্বে কখনো চলচ্চিত্রের ক্যামেরা চালাননি। শিল্প নির্দেশক বংশী চন্দ্রগুপ্তের পেশাদারী অভিজ্ঞতা ছিল, যিনি ল্য ফ্লোভ চলচ্চিত্রে জঁ রনোয়ারের সঙ্গে কাজ করেছিলেন। এই চলচ্চিত্রের পর মিত্র ও চন্দ্রগুপ্ত দুজনেই তাদের স্ব স্ব পেশায় প্রতিষ্ঠা লাভ করেছিলেন। মিত্র ল্য ফ্লোভ চলচ্চিত্রের সেটে সত্যজিৎ রায়ের সঙ্গে পরিচিত হয়েছিলেন, সেখানে মিত্র চলচ্চিত্র নির্মাণের বিভিন্ন বিষয়াদি পর্যবেক্ষণ, ছবি তোলা ও নিজের কাজের জন্য আলোক সম্পাতের উপর নোট করার অনুমতি পেয়েছিলেন। রায়ের সঙ্গে বন্ধুত্ব হওয়ার পর মিত্র তাকে চলচ্চিত্রটির নির্মাণ সম্পর্কে জানাতেন এবং তার ছবিগুলি দেখাতেন। রায় এই কাজে মুগ্ধ হয়ে তাকে পথের পাঁচালী চলচ্চিত্রে সহকারী হিসেবে নেওয়ার প্রতিশ্রুতি দেন, এবং যখন তিনি এই চলচ্চিত্রের কাজ শুরু করেন, তখন তাকে এই চলচ্চিত্রের চিত্রগ্রহণের জন্য আমন্ত্রণ জানান। ২১ বছর বয়সী মিত্রের চলচ্চিত্র নির্মাণের কোন অভিজ্ঞতা ছিল না, ফলে যারা চলচ্চিত্র নির্মাণ সম্পর্কে জ্ঞাত ছিলের তারা এই সিদ্ধান্তের ব্যাপারে সংশয় পোষণ করেছিল। মিত্র নিজে ধারণা করেছিলেন সত্যজিৎ রায় প্রতিষ্ঠিত কলাকুশলীদের নিয়ে কাজ করতে বিচলিত ছিলেন। শুরু থেকেই অর্থায়ন একটি বড় সমস্যা ছিল। কোন প্রযোজক এই চলচ্চিত্রে লগ্নি করতে আগ্রহী ছিলেন না, কারণ এতে বড় কোন তারকা নেই, কোন গান ও মারপিটের দৃশ্য নেই। সত্যজিৎ রায়ের পরিকল্পনা শুনে কল্পনা মুভিজের প্রযোজক ভট্টাচার্য বিভূতিভূষণ বন্দ্যোপাধ্যায়ের বিধবা স্ত্রীর সঙ্গে যোগাযোগ করে চলচ্চিত্রের স্বত্ব তাকে দেওয়ার অনুমতি চান এবং চলচ্চিত্রটি সে সময়ের প্রতিষ্ঠিত পরিচালক দেবকী বসুকে দিয়ে পরিচালনা করাতে চান। কিন্তু বন্দ্যোপাধ্যায়ের স্ত্রী তার প্রস্তাব প্রত্যাখ্যান করেন কারণ তিনি ইতোমধ্যে সত্যজিৎ রায়কে চলচ্চিত্র নির্মাণের অনুমতি প্রদান করেছিলেন। চলচ্চিত্রটির আনুমানিক নির্মাণব্যয় ছিল ₹৭০,০০০। রানা দত্ত নামে একজন প্রযোজক দৃশ্যধারণ চালু রাখার জন্য অর্থায়ন করেন, কিন্তু তার কয়েকটি চলচ্চিত্র ব্যবসায়িকভাবে ব্যর্থ হওয়ায় তিনি অর্থায়ন বন্ধ করে দেন। সত্যজিৎ রায়কে তাই আরও কিছু দৃশ্য ধারণ করতে ধার করতে হয়, যাতে তিনি সেই দৃশ্যগুলি দেখিয়ে কোন সম্ভাব্য প্রযোজককে সম্পূর্ণ চলচ্চিত্র অর্থায়নে রাজি করাতে পারেন। তহবিল সংগ্রহের জন্য তিনি গ্রাফিক্স নকশাবিদ হিসেবে তার কাজ চালিয়ে যান, তার জীবন বীমা পলিসি বন্ধক রাখেন এবং তার গ্রামোফোনের রেকর্ডের সংগ্রহ বিক্রি করে দেন। চলচ্চিত্রটির নির্মাণ ব্যবস্থাপক অনিল চৌধুরী সত্যজিৎ রায়ের স্ত্রী বিজয়াকে তার গহনাগুলি বন্ধক রাখতে বলেন। তথাপি দৃশ্যধারণের জন্য তার যথেষ্ট পরিমান অর্থ ছিল না, ফলে প্রায় এক বছর দৃশ্যধারণ বন্ধ ছিল। এরপর অল্প অল্প করে থেকে থেকে চিত্রগ্রহণ চলে। সত্যজিৎ রায় পরবর্তী কালে স্বীকার করেন যে এই দেরী হওয়া তাকে উদ্বিগ্ন করে তুলেছিল এবং তিনটি অভূতপূর্ব বিষয় চলচ্চিত্রটিকে রক্ষা করেছিল, \"এক, অপুর কণ্ঠ ভাঙ্গে নি। দুই, দুর্গা বড় হয়ে যায়নি। তিন, ইন্দির ঠাকরুন মারা যায়নি।\" পশ্চিমবঙ্গের মুখ্যমন্ত্রী বিধানচন্দ্র রায়কে সত্যজিৎ রায়ের মায়ের একজন প্রভাবশালী বন্ধু এই চলচ্চিত্র নির্মাণে সহায়তার জন্য অনুরোধ করেন। মুখ্যমন্ত্রী এতে এগিয়ে আসেন এবং সরকারি কর্মকর্তারা চলচ্চিত্রটির ধারণকৃত দৃশ্যগুলি দেখেন। পশ্চিমবঙ্গ সরকারের প্রচারণা বিভাগ চলচ্চিত্রটি নির্মাণের ব্যয়ের পরিমাণ মূল্যায়ন করেন এবং ঋণ অনুমোদন করেন, যাতে কিস্তিতে প্রদত্ত এই ঋণ দিয়ে সত্যজিৎ রায় নির্মাণ কাজ শেষ করতে পারেন। সরকার চলচ্চিত্রের প্রকৃতি বুঝতে পারেনি, তারা ভেবেছিল এটি গ্রামীণ উন্নয়ন সম্পর্কিত কোন প্রামাণ্যচিত্র, এবং ঋণটি এই চলচ্চিত্রের নামে \"রাস্তা উন্নয়ন\" খাতে নথিভুক্ত করেছিল। নিউ ইয়র্কের মিউজিয়াম অব মডার্ন আর্টের (এমওএম) প্রদর্শনী ও প্রকাশনা বিভাগের প্রধান মনরো হুইলার ১৯৫৪ সালে কলকাতায় ছিলেন। তিনি এই চলচ্চিত্রের ব্যাপারে শোনেন এবং সত্যজিৎ রায়ের সঙ্গে সাক্ষাৎ করেন। তিনি অসম্পূর্ণ দৃশ্যগুলিকে খুবই উচ্চমান সম্পন্ন বলে বিবেচনা করেন এবং সত্যজিৎ রায়কে চলচ্চিত্রটি সমাপ্ত করতে অনুপ্রাণিত করেন, যাতে এটি পরের বছর এমওএমএ'র প্রদর্শনীতে দেখাতে পারেন। ছয়মাস পর মার্কিন পরিচালক জন হিউস্টন তার দ্য ম্যান হু উড বি কিং (যা ১৯৭৫ সালে নির্মিত হয়েছিল) চলচ্চিত্রের কিছু স্থান নির্বাচনের জন্য ভারত এসেছিলেন। হুইলার হিউস্টনকে সত্যজিৎ রায়ের কাজের অগ্রগতি পর্যবেক্ষণ করতে বলেন। হিউস্টন অসম্পূর্ণ চলচ্চিত্রের অংশবিশেষ দেখেন এবং একে \"একজন বড়মাপের চলচ্চিত্র নির্মাতার কাজ\" বলে অভিহিত করেন। হিউস্টনের ইতিবাচক মত প্রদানের কারণে এমওএমএ সত্যজিৎ রায়কে অতিরিক্ত অর্থ প্রদান করে সাহায্য করে।অমিতাভ ঘোষের \"সত্যজিৎ রায়\" প্রবন্ধ। নির্মাণে দেরী ও ধারাবাহিকতায় ছেদ পড়া সহ পথের পাঁচালী চলচ্চিত্রটি দৃশ্যধারণ সমাপ্ত হতে তিন বছর লেগে যায়।", "references": ["", "Pather Panchali a popular Bangla novel written by bibhutibhushan bandyopadhyay.

Theron plays Wuornos while Ricci her lover Selby.  In pre-production, director Jenkins and Wuornos were writing to each other for around eight months. The night before her execution, Wuornos had her best friend open up the archive of every letter they wrote to each other in 12 years for the film.  To look like Wuornos, Charlize gained 30 pounds, sported false teeth and age spots, and also used a special gel to get those droopy eyes.  Charlize won the Best Actress Oscar for her Monster role on 29 February, which happened to be Wuornos's birthday.  The credits list the Chemical Brothers track in the film as Come with us but in actuality it is Where do I begin, with Beth Orton singing it.  Charlize's power-packed performance in The Devil's Advocate of a woman driven mad made Jenkins cast her in the role of Wuornos in Monster.  For the role of Selby, Brittany Murphy and Kate Beckinsale were considered before it went to Ricci.  Apart from Jenkins's film, two other films, both documentaries, were made on Wuornos by Nick Broomfield. The 1992 film was called Aileen Wuornos: The Selling of a Serial Killer, while the second part in 2003 was titled Wuornos, Aileen: The Life and Death of a Serial Killer.

Monroe Wheeler, who over the past half century was deeply involved in the publication and exhibition programs of the Museum of Modern Art, died Sunday at his home in Manhattan. He was 89 years old. Mr. Wheeler joined the staff in 1935, six years after the museum opened, and became a key figure in the institution's work. In 1941, he was named head of the department of exhibitions and publications, a post he kept until 1967, when he resigned to become an adviser to the board of trustees. Before joining the museum, Mr. Wheeler had been a publisher for six years in Europe, where he befriended many leading modern artists - among them Picasso, Renoir and Chagall -and commissioned deluxe illustrated books and limited-edition prints from them. His knowledge of and passion for books continued at the museum, and it was as head of the publications department that he made his greatest mark. He supervised the publication of more than 350 books on the visual arts, including Edward Steichen's book of photographs ''The Family of Man,'' and scholarly publications including John Rewald's ''History of Impressionism.'' ''He reached out and created a whole new public for the Modern,'' Richard Oldenburg, the museum's director, said yesterday. ''The museum became known for the quality of its books. He was passionately devoted to quality of illustration and design, and he developed the first-rate publishing by museums that we know today.'' A Detail Man In his role as director of exhibitions, Mr. Wheeler organized dozens of major museum shows, often tending to the myriad details of loan negotiations, budgets and staff management. ''It was as a diplomat, an organizer and a publisher, not as a scholar, that he made his career in the museum,'' wrote Russell Lynes of Mr. Wheeler in the 1973 history of the museum, ''Good Old Modern.'' After his retirement in 1967, Mr. Wheeler remained actively involved in museum business, especially as a trustee and as a member of the International Council, which supports the Modern's international exhibition and education programs. In 1968, Mr. Wheeler directed the exhibition ''Cezanne to Miro,'' which traveled to Argentina, Chile and Venezuela, the first major exhibition of modern art to travel from the United States to Latin America. Early this year, the museum dedicated a reading room in the Prints and Illustrated Books Galleries to Mr. Wheeler. He is survived by his brother, Richard Wheeler of Evanston, Ill., and his sister, Doris Bach, of Madison, Wisc. photo of Monroe Wheeler Also in Video » A wave of repression before the Olympics is inflicting deep damage.

কিন্তু এখানে নেতিবাচক সাড়ার ফলে সত্যজিৎ রায় \"খুবই মর্মাহত\" হন। কলকাতায় প্রেক্ষাগৃহে মুক্তির পূর্বে সত্যজিৎ রায় বৃহদাকৃতির পোস্টারের নকশা করেন, তন্মধ্যে ছিল অপু ও দুর্গার দৌড়ানার নিয়ন দৃশ্য, যা শহরের ব্যস্ততম স্থানগুলিতে স্থাপন করা হয়েছিল। পথের পাঁচালী কলকাতার চলচ্চিত্র প্রেক্ষাগৃহে মুক্তি পায় ২৬শে আগস্ট ১৯৫৫ সালে এবং শুরুতে খুবই অল্প সাড়া পড়ে। কিন্তু লোকমুখে শোনার পর এক বা দুই সপ্তাহের মধ্যেই প্রেক্ষাগৃহ লোকে পরিপূর্ণ হতে শুরু করে। এটি আবার আরেকটি প্রেক্ষাগৃহে মুক্তি দেওয়া হয় এবং সেখানে এটি সাত সপ্তাহব্যাপী চলে। আন্তঃভাষ্য তৈরিতে দেরী হওয়ায় যুক্তরাজ্যে মুক্তি ১৯৫৭ সালের ডিসেম্বর নাগাদ পিছিয়ে যায়। ১৯৫৮ সালে মার্কিন যুক্তরাষ্ট্রে এটি ব্যাপক সফলতা অর্জন করে এবং নিউ ইয়র্কের ফিফথ অ্যাভিনিউ প্লেহাউজে আটমাস ধরে চলে। মার্কিন যুক্তরাষ্ট্রে চলচ্চিত্রটির প্রারম্ভিক মুক্তি থেকে পশ্চিমবঙ্গ সরকার $৫০,০০০ আয় করে, এবং কয়েক দশক পরে ২০১৫ সালে সীমিত পরিসরে মুক্তি হতে চলচ্চিত্রটির আয় হয় $৪০২,৭২৩। সর্বোপরি, চলচ্চিত্রটি বিশ্বব্যাপী বক্স অফিসে মোট প্রায় ₹১০০ মিলিয়ন আয় করে। ভারতে চলচ্চিত্রটি ভূয়সী প্রশংসা লাভ করে। দ্য টাইমস অব ইন্ডিয়া লেখে, \"অন্য কোন ভারতীয় চলচ্চিত্রের সঙ্গে এর তুলনা বাতুলতামাত্র... পথের পাঁচালী একটি বিশুদ্ধ চলচ্চিত্র।\" পশ্চিমবঙ্গের মুখ্যমন্ত্রী বিধানচন্দ্র রায় কলকাতায় প্রধানমন্ত্রী জওহরলাল নেহরুর জন্য একটি বিশেষ প্রদর্শনীর ব্যবস্থা করেন, তিনি প্রেক্ষাগৃহ থেকে মুগ্ধ হয়ে বের হন। চলচ্চিত্রে দরিদ্রতার চিত্রায়নের জন্য পশ্চিমবঙ্গ ও ভারত সরকারের অভ্যন্তরের কয়েকজনের বিরোধিতা সত্ত্বেও নেহরুর অনুমতিতে পথের পাঁচালী ১৯৫৬ সালে কান চলচ্চিত্র উৎসবে প্রেরণ করা হয়। চলচ্চিত্রটি এই উৎসবের একেবারে শেষে প্রদর্শিত হয়, এবং কাকতালীয়ভাবে জাপানি প্রতিনিধিদের একটি পার্টির সঙ্গে একই সময়ে প্রদর্শনের কারণে অল্প সংখ্যক সমালোচক চলচ্চিত্রটি দেখেন। যদিও কয়েকজন শুরুতে আরেকটি সম্ভাব্য ভারতীয় অতিনাটকীয় চলচ্চিত্র দেখতে উৎসাহী ছিলেন না, কিন্তু চলচ্চিত্র সমালোচক আর্তুরো লানোসিতা চলচ্চিত্রটি সম্পর্কে মন্তব্য করেন, \"পদ্যের জাদুকরী ঘোড়া... যা পর্দায় দাপিয়ে বেড়াচ্ছে।\" পরবর্তীতে পথের পাঁচালী এই উৎসবের শ্রেষ্ঠ মানবিক দলিল পুরস্কার লাভ করে। কানের প্রদর্শনীর পর লিন্‌জি অ্যান্ডারসন মন্তব্য করেন যে, পথের পাঁচালী চলচ্চিত্রের \"চূড়ান্ত বিস্মরণীয় অভিজ্ঞতার গুণ রয়েছে।\" পরবর্তী বছরগুলিতে সমালোচকগণ চলচ্চিত্রটির ইতিবাচক পর্যালোচনা করেন। ১৯৫৮ সালে টাইম পত্রিকা পথের পাঁচালীকে \"রবার্ট ফ্ল্যাহার্টির ন্যানুক অব দ্য নর্থ-এর পর সম্ভবত লোককথার উপর চিত্রায়িত সুন্দরতম চলচ্চিত্র\" বলে অভিহিত করে। ১৯৮২ সালে পলিন কায়েল তার ৫০০১ নাইটস অ্যাট দ্য মুভিজ বইতে লেখেন, \"সুন্দর, মাঝে মাঝে আনন্দদায়ক ও ভালোবাসায় পরিপূর্ণ, এটি পর্দায় ভারতের নতুন দৃষ্টিকোণ নিয়ে এসেছে।\" ব্যাসিল রাইট এই চলচ্চিত্রটিকে \"শিল্পকলার নতুন ও অপ্রত্যাখেয় কর্ম\" বলে অভিহিত করেন। জেমস বেরার্ডিনেল্লি ১৯৯৬ সালে লেখেন, \"চলচ্চিত্রটি সাংস্কৃতিক ও ভাষাগত বাঁধা পেরিয়ে দর্শকদের আত্মা ও মন ছুয়ে যায়।\" ২০০৬ সালে দি অবজারভার-এর ফিলিপ ফ্রেঞ্চ একে \"সর্বকালের অন্যতম সেরা চলচ্চিত্র\" বলে অভিহিত করেন। পথের পাঁচালী মুক্তির ২০ বছর পর আকিরা কুরোসাওয়া বলেন, এই চলচ্চিত্রের প্রভাব সবকিছুকে ছাপিয়ে গেছে এবং এই চলচ্চিত্রের \"গভীর অনুভূতিকে নাড়া\" দেওয়ার ক্ষমতার তিনি বিশেষ প্রশংসা করেন। তবে এই চলচ্চিত্রের প্রতিক্রিয়া সমভাবে ইতিবাচক ছিল না। চলচ্চিত্রটি দেখার পর ফ্রঁসোয়া ত্রুফো বলেন, \"আমি এমন কোন চলচ্চিত্র দেখতে চাই না যেখানে একজন কৃষক হাত দিয়ে খাচ্ছে।\" দ্য নিউ ইয়র্ক টাইমস-এর প্রভাবশালী সমালোচক বসলি ক্রাউদার ১৯৫৮ সালে চলচ্চিত্রটির ধীরে ধীরে বিকশিত মর্মভেদী ও কাব্যিক গুণের প্রশংসা করলেও লেখেন, \"কাঠামোহীন বা তালিকাহীন গতিসমৃদ্ধ এই চলচ্চিত্রটি হলিউডের চলচ্চিত্র সম্পাদকদের \"এলোমেলো কর্তন\"-এর অংশ হিসেবেও পাস করতে পারতো না।\" দ্য হার্ভার্ড ক্রিমজন ১৯৫৯ সালে যুক্তি দেখান যে খণ্ড খণ্ড অংশে হওয়া \"এই চলচ্চিত্রের সবচেয়ে বড় দুর্বলতা: একে অকেজো করে ফেলে, দীর্ঘসময় মনোযোগ ধরে রাখতে ব্যর্থ হয়। পথের পাঁচালীর জন্য, এটি যেমনই অসাধারণ হোক না কেন, বসার মতো একটি কাজ। ১৯৮০-এর দশকের প্রারম্ভে সংসদ সদস্য ও সাবেক অভিনেত্রী নার্গিস দত্ত \"দারিদ্র্য রপ্তানি\"র জন্য সত্যজিৎ রায়ের সমালোচনা করেন। দারিয়ুস কুপার লেখেন, যদিও অনেক সমালোচক অপু ত্রয়ীতে প্রদর্শিত তৃতীয় বিশ্বের সংস্কৃতির উচ্চপ্রশংসা করেছেন, বাকিরা একটি সংস্কৃতির এমন প্রণয়মূলক রূপায়নের সমালোচনা করেন। ২০২১ সালের মে মাসের রটেন টম্যাটোসে ৬৯টি পর্যালোচনার ভিত্তিতে চলচ্চিত্রটির রেটিং ছিল ৯.৮/১০। ওয়েবসাইটটির সমালোচকদের ঐকমত্যে বলা হয় \"এমন একটি চলচ্চিত্র জার জন্য বিশেষ ধৈর্যের দরকার; পথের পাঁচালীর পরিচালক সত্যজিৎ রায়কে তার অভিষেকেই ধ্রুপদী কর্ম উপহার দিতে সাহায্য করেছে।\" ২০১৮ সালে চলচ্চিত্রটি বিবিসির সর্বকালের ১০০ সেরা বিদেশি ভাষার চলচ্চিত্র তালিকায় ১৫তম স্থান অধিকার করে। এবং চলচ্চিত্র নির্মাতা ক্রিস্টোফার নোলান এটিকে \"এখন পর্যন্ত নির্মিত সেরা চলচ্চিত্রগুলির মধ্যে একটি\" বলে অভিহিত করেছেন। ১৯৯০-এর দশকে সংরক্ষণ ১৯৯০-এর দশকে একাডেমি ফিল্ম আর্কাইভের সহযোগিতায় মার্চেন্ট আইভরি প্রডাকশন্স ও সনি পিকচার্স ক্লাসিকস এই চলচ্চিত্রের মুদ্রণ সংরক্ষণের প্রকল্পে হাতে নেয়। সংরক্ষিত মুদ্রণ ও সত্যজিৎ রায়ের আরও কয়েকটি চলচ্চিত্র মার্কিন যুক্তরাষ্ট্রের প্রেক্ষাগৃহে মুক্তির জন্য নির্বাচিত হয়। পথের পাঁচালী চলচ্চিত্রটি রিজিয়ন ২ (ডিভিডি রিজিয়ন কোড) পিএএল ও রিজিয়ন ১ এনটিএসসি ডিভিডি সংস্করণে পাওয়া যায়। আর্টিফিশিয়াল আই এন্টারটেইনমেন্ট রিজিয়ন ২ এবং কলাম্বিয়া ট্রাই-স্টার রিজিয়ন ১ ডিভিডি সংস্করণের পরিবেশক। ২০১৫ সালে পুনরুদ্ধার ২০১৩ সালে ভিডিও পরিবেশক কোম্পানি দ্য ক্রাইটেরিয়ন কালেকশন একাডেমি অব মোশন পিকচার আর্টস অ্যান্ড সায়েন্সেসের চলচ্চিত্র আর্কাইভের সঙ্গে মিলে পথের পাঁচালী-সহ অপু ত্রয়ী'র মূল নেগেটিভগুলি সংরক্ষণের কাজ শুরু করে। ১৯৯৩ সালে লন্ডনে এক অগ্নিকাণ্ডে মারাত্মকভাবে ক্ষতিগ্রস্ত হয় এবং সত্যজিৎ রায়ের সবকয়টি চলচ্চিত্রের ধারণকৃত ছবি ও খণ্ডাংশগুলি সংরক্ষণের জন্য মোশন পিকচার একাডেমিতে পাঠানো হয়েছিল, যা প্রায় দুই দশক অগোচরে পড়ে রয়েছিল। পুনঃপরীক্ষণের সময় এটি আবিষ্কার করা হয়, যদিও চলচ্চিত্রগুলির অনেকগুলি অংশ সত্যিই অগ্নিকাণ্ডে এবং সময়ের প্রভাবে নষ্ট হয়ে গিয়েছিল, বাকি অংশগুলি উদ্ধারযোগ্য ছিল। এই বস্তুগুলি ইতালির বোলোনিয়ায় লিমাজিন রিত্রোভাতা পুনরুদ্ধার গবেষণাগারে পাঠানো হয়। নেগেটিভগুলি পুনরুদ্ধার ও স্ক্যান করতে প্রায় এক হাজার ঘণ্টা শ্রম ব্যয়ের পর পথের পাঁচালীর ৪০% নেগেটিভ পুনরুদ্ধার করা সম্ভব হয়। নেগেটিভের যেসব অংশ পাওয়া যাচ্ছিল না বা ব্যবহার অনুপযোগী ছিল, সেসব অংশে নকল নেগেটিভ এবং বিভিন্ন বাণিজ্যিক ও আর্কাইভকৃত উৎস থেকে প্রাপ্ত সর্বোৎকৃষ্ট অংশগুলি ব্যবহৃত হয়েছিল। তিনটি চলচ্চিত্রের ডিজিটাল সংস্করণ তৈরিতে দ্য ক্রাইটেরিয়ন কালেকশনের নিজস্ব গবেষণাগারে ছয়মাস ব্যয় হয়, এবং চলচ্চিত্রগুলি ভিন্নভাবে সংরক্ষিত হয় ও কিছু ত্রুটিও থেকে যায়। ২০১৫ সালের ৪ঠা মে পুনরুদ্ধারকৃত পথের পাঁচলী মিউজিয়াম অব মডার্ন আর্টে প্রদর্শিত হয়। ৬০ বছরের কিছু সময় পূর্বে একই স্থানে এই চলচ্চিত্রের বৈশ্বিক উদ্বোধনী প্রদর্শনী হয়েছিল। কয়েকদিন পর তিনটি চলচ্চিত্রই নিউ ইয়র্কের ফিল্ম ফোরামে প্রদর্শিত হয়, যেখানে এই চলচ্চিত্র তিনটি তিন সপ্তাহ প্রদর্শনের জন্য তালিকাভুক্ত হয়েছিল। জনগণের অধিক চাহিদার ফলে এবং একজন লেখক মন্তব্য \"যথেষ্ট দর্শক দেখতে পারছে না\"-এর ফলে চলচ্চিত্রগুলি ৩০শে জুন পর্যন্ত এই প্রেক্ষাগৃহে প্রদর্শিত হয়। এই ত্রয়ী চলচ্চিত্র পরে মার্কিন যুক্তরাষ্ট্র ও কানাডার অনেকগুলি শহরে প্রদর্শনীর জন্য পাঠানো হয়েছিল। এই পুনরুদ্ধারকৃত কাজটি বেশ সমাদৃত হয়, এবং অনেকেই মন্তব্য করেন যে পুনরুদ্ধারকৃত চলচ্চিত্রগুলি দেখতে \"জমকালো\", \"অকৃত্রিম\", ও \"বিস্ময়কর\"।", "references": ["", "", "Get this book in print Covering the years spanning cinema’s emergence as a popular form in Bengal in the first half of the twentieth century, this book examines the main genres and trends produced by this cinema, and leads up to Bengali cinema’s last phase of transition in the 1980s. Arguing that Bengali cinema has been a key economic and social institution, the author highlights that the Bengali filmic imaginary existed over and above the imaginary of the Indian nation. This book argues that a definitive history of Bengali cinema presents an alternative understanding to the currently influential notion of the Hindi film as the ‘Indian’ or ‘national’ cinema. It suggests that the Bengali cinema presents a history which brings to the fore the deeply contested terrain of ‘national’ cinema, and shows the creation of the ‘alternative imaginary’ of the Bengali film. The author indicates that the case of the Bengali cinema demonstrates the emergence of a public domain that set up a definitive discourse of difference with respect to the ‘all-India’ Hindi film, popularly classified as Bollywood cinema, and which pre-empted its subsumption within the more pervasive culture of the Bombay Hindi cinema. As the first comprehensive historical work on Bengali cinema, this book makes a significant contribution to both Film and Cultural Studies and South Asian Studies in general.

In the Fall of 1954 Monroe Wheeler, a director at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, had come to Calcutta. He met Satyajit Ray and learned that he was making a film. He saw some stills and immediately invited Ray to send the film to the exhibition that would open at MOMA the following year. A few months later, John Huston arrived in Calcutta to scout locations for his film The Man Who Would Be King. He had already heard about Ray and his work. Ray showed him a half-hour of rough cut of the visual highlights — among them the scene of the running train in the field of white Kaash. Huston was moved: \"A grim and serious piece of film making, which should go down well in the West,\" he commented. Wheeler got the glowing report from Huston. A hastily finished first print was sent to New York in May 1955. It was screened without subtitles to an adoring audience moved by the film's humanist appeal and imaginative photography. Ray alludes to these vignettes and many more in his posthumously published Memoir on the making of the Trilogy (My Years With Apu, A Memoir, by Satyajit Ray; New Delhi: Viking, 1994). He waited with great anticipation for the Bengali audience's first reaction to the screening of Pather Panchali in August 1955. Using his expertise in publicity gained as an executive at D. G. Keymer & Co., a British Advertising firm in Calcutta, he had designed five billboards for the film. The response was instantaneous. \"For the first time I tasted triumph,\" Ray writes, \"with unknown young people elbowing their way through the milling crowd to kiss the hem of my garment as it were.\" Contrary to common belief that Pather Panchali was appreciated in Ray's hometown only after it had received awards abroad, the film was in fact a box office hit from the day of its premiere. However, it ran only for six weeks. Ray explains why. The theater in South Calcutta showing Pather Panchali was booked in advance for the screening of Insaniyat, a film by S.S. Vasan, the South Indian Cecil B. De Mille. The day after his film was taken off, Ray was awakened early in the morning by his servant. He had a dhoti-clad visitor: Mr. S.S. Vasan. Asked by Ray what had brought such a distinguished director to his door so early in the morning, Vasan replied, \"You! I had been to see your film last night. If I had known that that was the film Insaniyat was going to replace, I would certainly have withheld my opening. You have made a great film, Sir.\" Ray had fought against overwhelming odds to come to this point. Backed by a handful of young film buffs, equipped with sketches and notes on select episodes of Pather Panchali, Bibhutibhusan Bandyopadhyay's epic novel, he had approached all the major and minor producers in Calcutta. They included B.N. Sirkar, \"a sort of Bengali Louis B Mayer,\" and a fledgling named Das who was trying to produce from a \"seedy hotel in the heart of central Calcutta.\" These led him nowhere. But Ray had made up his mind. He had decided to go ahead on his own with a hand picked cast of mostly non-professionals and a crew of rookies. His cameraman Subrata Mitra, for example, had not handled a movie camera before. Ray's familiarity with this magic tool extended to possessing a second-hand Leica. While funding these faltering efforts, he had pawned his classical western music collection and his wife's jewelry. The project finally got going through his mother Suprabha Ray's intervention. She knew one Mrs. Bela Sen who was a personal friend of Dr. B.C. Roy, the Chief Minister. Dr. Roy agreed to offer state funding. Moved by the film, Dr. Roy had arranged for a special screening for Pundit Nehru. Already vested interests in India's filmdom were building barricades against Pather Panchali. Nehru saw the film at Calcutta's Lighthouse Miniature Theater flanked by Dr. Roy and Satyajit Ray who did the occasional translation. Nehru too was moved and quickly acted to ruin all opposition to the film's proposed entry to the 1956 Cannes Film Festival. Officials attending the festival did precious little to publicize or promote the film. The screening took place on a holiday at midnight. The result: most jurors did not show up. Amongst those who did were Ray aficionados — Lindsay Anderson, Lotte Eisner, Andre Bazin, George Sadoul and Gene Moskowitz. They persuaded the Festival Committee to organize a second screening with all the jurors present. Pather Panchali went on to receive the Special Jury Prize for the Best Human Document. Later the film received a dozen or more national and international awards. The recognition, writes Ray, persuaded him to take the plunge. He decided to give up advertising and turn to film making as a full time career. The choice was a logical one for Ray: He had been training, we now know, for years in the arts and sciences of motion pictures. But who were his role models, and which film making traditions was he attracted to? >>> Next in the series: Mastering the Language of Cinema Ray alludes to these vignettes and many more in his posthumously published Memoir on the making of the Trilogy (My Years With Apu, A Memoir, by Satyajit Ray; New Delhi: Viking, 1994). He waited with great anticipation for the Bengali audience's first reaction to the screening of Pather Panchali in August 1955. Using his expertise in publicity gained as an executive at D. G. Keymer & Co., a British Advertising firm in Calcutta, he had designed five billboards for the film. The response was instantaneous. \"For the first time I tasted triumph,\" Ray writes, \"with unknown young people elbowing their way through the milling crowd to kiss the hem of my garment as it were.\" Contrary to common belief that Pather Panchali was appreciated in Ray's hometown only after it had received awards abroad, the film was in fact a box office hit from the day of its premiere. However, it ran only for six weeks. Ray explains why. The theater in South Calcutta showing Pather Panchali was booked in advance for the screening of Insaniyat, a film by S.S. Vasan, the South Indian Cecil B. De Mille. The day after his film was taken off, Ray was awakened early in the morning by his servant. He had a dhoti-clad visitor: Mr. S.S. Vasan. Asked by Ray what had brought such a distinguished director to his door so early in the morning, Vasan replied, \"You! I had been to see your film last night. If I had known that that was the film Insaniyat was going to replace, I would certainly have withheld my opening. You have made a great film, Sir.\" Ray had fought against overwhelming odds to come to this point. Backed by a handful of young film buffs, equipped with sketches and notes on select episodes of Pather Panchali, Bibhutibhusan Bandyopadhyay's epic novel, he had approached all the major and minor producers in Calcutta. They included B.N. Sirkar, \"a sort of Bengali Louis B Mayer,\" and a fledgling named Das who was trying to produce from a \"seedy hotel in the heart of central Calcutta.\" These led him nowhere. But Ray had made up his mind. He had decided to go ahead on his own with a hand picked cast of mostly non-professionals and a crew of rookies. His cameraman Subrata Mitra, for example, had not handled a movie camera before. Ray's familiarity with this magic tool extended to possessing a second-hand Leica. While funding these faltering efforts, he had pawned his classical western music collection and his wife's jewelry. The project finally got going through his mother Suprabha Ray's intervention. She knew one Mrs. Bela Sen who was a personal friend of Dr. B.C. Roy, the Chief Minister. Dr. Roy agreed to offer state funding. Moved by the film, Dr. Roy had arranged for a special screening for Pundit Nehru. Already vested interests in India's filmdom were building barricades against Pather Panchali. Nehru saw the film at Calcutta's Lighthouse Miniature Theater flanked by Dr. Roy and Satyajit Ray who did the occasional translation. Nehru too was moved and quickly acted to ruin all opposition to the film's proposed entry to the 1956 Cannes Film Festival. Officials attending the festival did precious little to publicize or promote the film. The screening took place on a holiday at midnight. The result: most jurors did not show up. Amongst those who did were Ray aficionados — Lindsay Anderson, Lotte Eisner, Andre Bazin, George Sadoul and Gene Moskowitz. They persuaded the Festival Committee to organize a second screening with all the jurors present. Pather Panchali went on to receive the Special Jury Prize for the Best Human Document. Later the film received a dozen or more national and international awards. The recognition, writes Ray, persuaded him to take the plunge. He decided to give up advertising and turn to film making as a full time career. The choice was a logical one for Ray: He had been training, we now know, for years in the arts and sciences of motion pictures.

We know what the Minions are and they deliver no less (or more) than we expect from them. As much about atonement and forgiveness as it is a critique of Colonial attitudes of racism and white supremacy that are deeply entrenched in Western society. Genre fans may perceive it as good enough to scratch an itch but no matter how well it incorporates the Jane Austen tropes, it’s hard to see this as more than obligatory and unnecessary. At times frustrating and at times exuberant, the movie is effective in capturing both the triumph and tragedy of the title character’s life. Brings back memories of when “horror” meant more than an assembled sequence of shocks and blood-soaked cliches. Derivative and forgettable; fitfully entertaining but ultimately lacking. It features enough eye candy to keep most kids engaged and boasts just enough heft that adults won’t spend 100 minutes looking at their watches. The screenplay, which effectively balances comedic moments with dramatic ones, has some uneven moments, but Thompson’s performance never wavers. Although it functions as a warped, modern-day fairy tale, there’s more than a little bit of truth to be found just beneath the surface.

Bosley Crowther, the film critic of The New York Times from 1940 to 1967 and for many years one of the nation's most powerful and respected voices on the cinema, died of heart failure yesterday at Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco, N.Y. He was 75 years old and lived in Somers, N.Y. In an era when television was growing up and movies were still the major cultural force in America life, Mr. Crowther was perhaps the most influential commentator in the country on the art and industry of motion pictures. His reviews, appearing three or four times a week in The Times, and his longer analyses in the columns of the paper's Sunday drama section, were often decisive in shaping the careers and fortunes of Hollywood actors, directors and screenwriters. Mr. Crowther, who was educated at Princeton, was the author of five books and two plays and was a member of The Times's staff for nearly 40 years. He covered a wide variety of assignments as a general reporter, feature writer and rewrite man before embarking on his 27-year career as a critic. Early Advocate of Foreign Films His reviews and articles spanned a revolutionary period in film art and film criticism - the transition from black and white to color, the internationalization of the cinema, the growth of independent film making and the coming of television. Though his focus was primarily on Hollywood and its appeals to popular taste, Mr. Crowther was an early and enthusiastic advocate of what became a cultural boom in foreign films in the 1950's and 1960's, particularly those of Roberto Rossellini, Vittorio De Sica, Ingmar Bergman and Federico Fellini. In the 1950's, he turned his critical spotlight on Senator Joseph R. McCarthy, the Wisconsin Republican whose anti-Communist crusade left much of Hollywood in turmoil. Mr. Crowther fought against the blacklisting of supposed Hollywood Communists and ridiculed the stridently patriotic movies of those years. He also championed the fight against statutory censorship of motion pictures, while calling consistently for greater social responsibility, as he saw it, in the making of American movies. He frequently was critical of films that portrayed violence in what he saw as a sensationalized way. Scholarly Style of Language Conscious of the power of his reviews, Mr. Crowther rendered his judgments in scholarly rather than breezy language and conservative rather than raffish tones. His sober, resolutely nonpoetic style conveyed wit and the talent of a good storyteller, but it reflected his own fairness and sense of responsibility toward his craft. It also gave no quarter to cacophonous critical notices by some colleagues. There was, thus, an almost official quality to his writing. What appealed to him most were movies of social content - ''Citizen Kane,'' ''The Grapes of Wrath,'' and ''Gone With the Wind,'' for example - and he liked to remind readers in his Sunday columns that there were virtues in such films as ''The Lost Weekend,'' ''The Red Shoes'' and ''All the King's Men.'' He also defended fluffier films like ''Ben-Hur,'' ''Gigi,'' and the enormously expensive production of ''Cleopatra.'' And he denounced as ''a blending of farce with brutal killings'' the violence in the successful 1967 movie ''Bonnie and Clyde,'' which some other critics praised as an effort to convey the breakdown of moral and social values during the Depression. Though he wrote as many as 200 film reviews and 50 longer Sunday articles each year, Mr. Crowther found time to write three books during his 27-year career as a critic, as well as two that appeared after he became critic emeritus in 1968. Wrote Book on Mayer His books were ''The Lion's Share: the Story of an Entertainment Empire,'' a history of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer that appeared in 1957; ''Hollywood Rajah: the Life and Times of Louis B. Mayer,'' published in 1960; ''The Great Films: Fifty Golden Years of Motion Pictures,'' a compendium of essays on selected movies, published in 1967; ''Vintage Films,'' another series of essays, in 1977, and ''Reruns,'' in 1978. Francis Bosley Crowther Jr. was born in Lutherville, Md., on July 13, 1905, the son of F. Bosley and Eliza Leisenring Crowther. Like his father, he dropped his first name in favor of Bosley. He attended grade schools in Lutherville and high schools in Winston-Salem, N.C., and Washington, D.C., before entering Woodbury Forest School in Woodbury, Va. A stocky man with white hair, blue eyes and a cultured voice, Mr. Crowther was a three-time president of the New York Film Critics and, in 1954, received the first award for film criticism given by the Screen Directors Guild. Mr. Crowther counted a few actors among his close friends, but in his many appearances as a lecturer and privately among acquaintances he frequently debunked the notion that a critic's life was romantic. ''There is, I am told, a vagrant notion that all we members of the screen department do is go to movies and sit around drinking in plush cafes with voluptuous Hollywood stars,'' he said in a 1951 article for Times Talk, The Times's house organ. ''To be sure, we do go to movies. But if any invidious outsider has the notion that this is all we do, he has another notion coming.'' Mr. Crowther attended three or four movies each week, many of them early in his critical career on the occasion of their New York premiers though he, and other critics, later began attending private, pre-premier screenings as a matter of convenience. He always preferred to write his review immediately after a screening, rushing back to his office from the theater and writing against a deadline. Mr. Crowther loved movies. He saw his last film, ''Tess,'' a week ago with his wife, the former Florence Marks, relatives said yesterday. He saw his first at the age of 5 or 6, one of the early screen programs of a film maker named Lyman B. Howe, who supplemented his pictures with sound produced from a gramaphone behind the screen. Mr. Crowther is survived by his wife, Florence; a sister, Nancy Crowther Kappes, of Old Saybrook, Conn.; three sons, F. Bosley 3d, of Troy, Va., John, of Los Angeles, and Jefferson, of Pomona, N.Y., and four grandchildren.

THE Indian film, \"Pather Panchali\" (\"Song of the Road\"), which opened at the Fifth Avenue Cinema yesterday, is one of those rare exotic items, remote in idiom from the usual Hollywood film, that should offer some subtle compensations to anyone who has the patience to sit through its almost two hours. Chief among the delicate revelations that emerge from its loosely formed account of the pathetic little joys and sorrows of a poor Indian family in Bengal is the touching indication that poverty does not always nullify love and that even the most afflicted people can find some modest pleasures in their worlds. This theme, which is not as insistent or sentimental as it may sound, barely begins to be evident after the picture has run at least an hour. And, in that time, the most the camera shows us in a rambling and random tour of an Indian village is a baffling mosaic of candid and crude domestic scenes. There are shots of a creaky old woman, a harassed mother, her lively little girl and a cheerful husband and father who plainly cannot provide for his small brood. There are scenes, as familiar as next-door neighbors, of the mother trying to get the child to eat, washing clothes, quarreling with the husband or pushing the child toward school. Satyajit Roy, Indian artist, who wrote the screen play and directed this film, provides ample indication that this is his first professional motion picture job. Any picture as loose in structure or as listless in tempo as this one is would barely pass as a \"rough cut\" with the editors in Hollywood. But, oddly enough, as it continues—as the bits in the mosaic increase and a couple of basically human and dramatic incidents are dropped in, such as the pitiful death of the old woman and the sickness and death of the little girl—the poignant theme emerges and the whole thing-takes a slim poetic form. By the time it comes to its sad end, it has the substance of a tender threnody. Much of the effect is accomplished by some stunningly composed domestic scenes, well performed—or pictured—by an excellent Indian cast, and exquisitely photographed by Subrata Mitra in tastefully filtered blacks and whites. And a finely conceived and sympathetic original musical score, composed by Ravi Shankar, in which native instruments are employed, sets the whole sad story in the frame of a melancholy mood. Karuna Banerji is touching as the mother who is most distressed by poverty and Uma Das Gupta is lovely and sensitive as the girl. Chunibala Devi is fantastically realistic and effective as the aging crone and Subir Banerji is wistful and beguiling as the small son of the family. As we say, it is quite exotic. The dialogue often sounds like a Gramophone record going at high speed. English subtitles barely make some sense. But there are lovely little threads in the strange fabric. It's a film that takes patience to be enjoyed. PATHER PANCHALI, screen play by Satyajit Roy; based on the novel by B. Bandopadhaya; directed by Mr. Roy; presented by Edward Harrison.

Harimoran Nag Also in Arts » Movies All NYT ", "", "In Pather Panchali, director Satyijit Ray has recorded certain portions of the life of an Indian family over a ten year period, describing the interaction of the five important characters: the mother and father, a daughter, a young son, and an old sick aunt. Shortly after the beginning of the film, Apu, the son, becomes a central figure, the viewer of the action, the mute commentator. The first we see of him is an eye, which his sister opens with her fingers; and his eye follows the action for the rest of the film, peering over stone walls, looking out from the folds of a cloak, staring down at the ground at his sister's death. By the middle, the film take on the appearance of the collage (for the episodes are disconnected, breaking off in the middle and resuming at some later time), and the focus of the story--of all that is going on--seems to exist in the mind of the boy. There is no doubt that Pather Panchali is a remarkable film; there are some spots which have amazing impact, and the photography throughout is magnificent. Certain of the photographic effects tend toward the abstract, such as he delicate designs made of waterlily stalks and water bugs. There are certain very powerful moments, moments when one seems to move closer to the picture than he is at other times. Perhaps the finest scene in Pather Panchali shows the sickness of the daughter during a storm. Windows fly open and the rain blows in; the mother labors at fastening them again. Finally she turns back to the dying child, who raises her arms to her, and the two embrace. It is a moment of incredible power. No other part of the film is comparable to this one. Many of the fragmented episodes are effective, but many others have little to add to the general effect. The disconnection itself has its purpose, and gives an all-inclusive quality to the film; yet it is also distracting and contributes to the film's great weakness: its general diffuseness, its inability to command sustained attention. For Pather Panchali, remarkable as it may be, is something of a chore to sit through. The viewer receives the impression that he is watching a document, an amazing document to be sure, but not an entirely absorbing one--and thus his eyes keep drifting over to the blue rimmed clock at the side of the screen. One can see the beauty of the camera work, the delicacy of the composition, but one can stare in dull amaze for only so long. Critics of great note and little restraint have called Pather Panchali \"great art\" and a \"universal experience,\" these terms being in great vogue at the present time, and very easy to come by. Thus those who want to see \"great art\" and have \"universal experiences\" will enjoy Pather Panchali no end. Those who wish to be entertained, however, should be warned that Pather Panchali, while often beautiful, may require more patience than they are willing to muster.

Copyright © 2005, The Harvard Crimson Inc. | Privacy Policy | Terms and Conditions", "", " Home Film Art Books Music TV Style Identities Designed The Collection More Three years ago, BBC Culture ran its first major critics’ poll, to find the 100 greatest American films. Two further polls looked for the best films of the 21st Century and the greatest comedies ever made – and those also ended up with films from the US in the top spot. This year, we felt it was time to direct the spotlight away from Hollywood and celebrate the best cinema from around the world. We asked critics to vote for their favourite movies made primarily in a language other than English. The result is BBC Culture’s 100 greatest foreign-language films. Read more about BBC Culture’s 100 greatest foreign-language films: - What the critics had to say about the top 25- The full list of critics – and how they voted- Why Seven Samurai is number one- Foreign-language masterpieces you may not know From the perspective of an English-language website, that’s an accurate description – but equally, as an internationally-focused one, we’re happy to acknowledge that, depending on who you are, many of these films won’t be in a language that’s foreign to you. And as the poll exists to salute the extraordinary diversity and richness of films from all around the world, we wanted to ensure that its voters were from all around the world, too. The 209 critics who took part are from 43 different countries and speak a total of 41 languages – a range that sets our poll apart from any other. The result: 100 films from 67 different directors, from 24 countries, and in 19 languages. French can claim to be the international language of acclaimed cinema: 27 of the highest-rated films were in French, followed by 12 in Mandarin, and 11 each in Italian and Japanese. At the other end of the scale, several languages were represented by just one film, such as Belarusian (Come and See), Romanian (4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days), and Wolof (Touki Bouki). If there’s anything disappointing about the final list, it’s the paucity of films directed or co-directed by women. There are just four out of 100. But we made sure to contact as many female critics as male ones; of those who responded, 94 (45 per cent) were women. One statistic we noted was that a quarter of the films on our list were East Asian: that is, 25 of them were made in Japan (11), China (6), Taiwan (4), Hong Kong (3) or South Korea (1). And the winning film, Seven Samurai, by the Japanese director Akira Kurosawa, was loved by critics everywhere – everywhere, that is, except for Japan. The six Japanese critics who voted didn’t go for a single Kurosawa film between them. But it’s clear that culture isn’t bound by borders, and language needn’t be a barrier to enjoying great film-making. While the cinema of an individual nation is inevitably tied to its unique identity and history, the language of film is universal. One more thing: the purpose of every BBC Culture film poll has always been to generate debate as well as encourage discovery. And we are aware that no list can be either definitive or please everyone – so get in touch using the hashtag #WorldFilm100 and let us know what’s missing.

The filmmaker brought the fight to preserve celluloid usage to Mumbai Find your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profile Filmmaking cinephile Christopher Nolan's passion for the works of Stanley Kubrick and war classics including All Quiet on the Western Front loom large in his films. Now, the Dunkirk director has revealed yet another title which he believes to be one of the greatest films ever made. Nolan - whose films include Memento and the Dark Knight trilogy - named Pather Panchali from Indian filmmaker Satyajit Ray during a recent visit to Mumbai, India where he brought his fight to preserve celluloid usage in cinema to the country boasting the world's largest film industry. Released in 1955, Pather Panchali - translated as 'Song of the Little Road' - depicts the childhood of young boy Apu (Subir Banerjee) and his elder sister Durga (Uma Dasgupta) and the harsh village life of their poor family. He attended a series of events dedicated to a campaign titled 'Reframing the Future of Film' which saw 70mm and 35mm screenings of his films including Interstellar. Speaking to press regarding the visit, Nolan said: “We had a very productive session with the Indian industry, just like we have had in Hollywood and the UK. We are really trying to engage filmmakers in this discussion in how we can continue to enjoy a celluloid, photochemical, analogue infrastructure in filmmaking.” He continued: “It’s not about film versus digital - it's about preserving this medium for future generations.” RKO Radio Pictures RKO Radio Pictures Paramount Pictures United Artists Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Columbia Pictures United Artists United Artists United Artists Universal Pictures 2012 Getty Images Miramax Films Getty Images Warner Bros Gramercy Pictures Paramount Pictures Columbia Oscilloscope Laboratories CBS Films Universal Pictures Universal Pictures Universal Pictures Netflix Nolan vowed to “watch more Indian films in future,” stating: “I have had the pleasure of watching [Satyajit] Ray’s Pather Panchali recently, which I hadn’t seen before. I think it is one of the best films ever made. It is an extraordinary piece of work. I am interested in learning more about Indian film industry and that is the reason why I came.” The filmmaker earned his first Best Director nomination at the 2018 Oscars for Dunkirk, the WWII film which won a total of three. Ahead of the film's release in July 2017, Nolan curated a season of films that inspired it for the British Film Institute (BFI).

RKO Radio PicturesOscars: 21 great films that never won Best PictureThe Searchers (1956)The Searchers may be considered John Ford's greatest film, but it was not treated as such back in the 1950s. In fact, the western starring John Wayne failed to earn a single nomination. Around the World in 80 Days turned out to be more the Academy's cup of tea.RKO Radio PicturesOscars: 21 great films that never won Best PictureVertigo (1958)Not only did Alfred Hitchcock never win an Oscar (save for his memorial award in 1968), but neither did any of his films – one of which is Vertigo, a classic that won Sight & Sound's once-a-decade greatest films of all time poll in 2012. If it had been nominated, it would have faced stiff competition in the form of eventual winner All About Eve.Paramount PicturesOscars: 21 great films that never won Best PictureThe Graduate (1967)One of the films that kickstarted the New Hollywood Cinema era, The Graduate may have won director Mike Nichols an Oscar, but it ultimately lost out to Norman Jewison's In the Heat of the Night. United ArtistsOscars: 21 great films that never won Best Picture2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)Stanley Kubrick's sci-fi classic remains one of the most influential pieces of cinema there is. The Academy didn't agree. The Academy nominated Kubrick for Best Director and awarded the visual effects in favour of considering 2001 for Best Picture (it didn't even get nominated). That year's winner was Oliver!, the musical by Carol Reed.Metro-Goldwyn-MayerOscars: 21 great films that never won Best PictureTaxi Driver (1976)Despite Taxi Driver's failure to win the main award, its nomination in four categories showed the Academy had good intentions. That All the President's Men and Network also lost out to eventual winner Rocky shows that, ultimately, it never really stood a chance.Columbia PicturesOscars: 21 great films that never won Best PictureApocalypse Now (1979)Francis Ford Coppola's ambitious Vietnam War epic Apocalypse Now received a grand total of eight nominations, but only went home with two prizes (for cinematography and sound) losing out to drama Kramer vs. Kramer.United ArtistsOscars: 21 great films that never won Best PictureRaging Bull (1980)Of all the Oscar blows dealt to Martin Scorsese over the decades, none landed harder than Raging Bull losing out to Robert Redford's weepie Ordinary People, an oversight many consider one of the Academy's most egregious. United ArtistsOscars: 21 great films that never won Best PictureBlade Runner (1982)Another sci-fi classic overlooked by the Oscars was Blade Runner, which didn't even get nominated in the Best Picture category (Gandhi ended up winning). Ridley Scott's The Martian went on to receive seven nominations in 2017 – evidence, perhaps, of the Academy taking responsibility for its past errors.United ArtistsOscars: 21 great films that never won Best PictureDo the Right Thing (1989)Spike Lee's Do the Right Thing failing to win Best Picture at the 1990 Oscars is one thing – losing out to Driving Miss Daisy is another thing altogether. Universal PicturesOscars: 21 great films that never won Best PictureGoodfellas (1990)Having awarded both The Godfather Part I and The Godfather Part II Best Picture in 1972 and 1974 respectively, the Academy seemed destined to appreciate Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas. But no – Kevin Costner's directorial debut Dances with Wolves was the most appealing choice for voters.2012 Getty ImagesOscars: 21 great films that never won Best PicturePulp Fiction (1994)New talent on the block Quentin Tarantino's second feature Pulp Fiction won him the coveted Palme d'Or at Cannes in 1994 – a success he failed to match back on home turf. While he won an Original Screenplay Oscar, his film was beaten by Forrest Gump...Miramax FilmsOscars: 21 great films that never won Best PictureThe Shawshank Redemption (1994)...and it wasn't the only one. Frank Darabont's adaptation of Stephen King's prison-set novella The Shawshank Redemption also fell victim to Robert Zemeckis' Oscar-friendly Forrest Gump. We don't see that film sitting atop the IMDb top 250 though, do we?Getty ImagesOscars: 21 great films that never won Best PictureHeat (1995)If Heat was released today, there's no way it wouldn't be a Best Picture frontrunner. That it was completely ignored in favour of Braveheart is a huge travesty.Warner BrosOscars: 21 great films that never won Best PictureFargo (1996)You may think it was remiss of the Academy to shun Fargo, but it did come pretty close to winning, its chances bolstered somewhat by seven nominations and two wins (Actress for Frances McDormand and Original Screenplay for the Coen Brothers). It lost out to The English Patient.Gramercy PicturesOscars: 21 great films that never won Best PictureSaving Private Ryan (1998)Having won Best Director five years previous for Schindler's List, Steven Spielberg was strongly expected to take home the top prizes for his Second World War epic. Cue Shakespeare In Love upsetting everybody.Paramount PicturesOscars: 21 great films that never won Best PictureThe Social Network (2010)David Fincher's Facebook drama got shunned in favour of British patriotism in an Oscar two-horse race for the ages that ultimately saw The King's Speech crowned winner.ColumbiaOscars: 21 great films that never won Best PictureWe Need to Talk About Kevin (2011)Lynne Ramsay has directed two films that would have been deserving of Best Picture: You Were Never Really Here and this, We Need to Talk About Kevin. It's easy to see why Hollywood was temporarily more charmed by The Artist, but it's clear which film will stand the test of time.Oscilloscope LaboratoriesOscars: 21 great films that never won Best PictureInside Llewyn Davis (2013)It's almost unthinkable to recall that the Coen brothers' Inside Llewyn Davis only scored two Oscar nominations in the cinematography and sound mixing categories, respectively. In the ensuing years, the film has been hailed as one of the greatest of the 2010s, meaning that its no-show at the Oscars will go down as one of the Academy's biggest omissions. Still, it would have had a hard time winning over 12 Years a Slave.CBS FilmsOscars: 21 great films that never won Best PictureBoyhood (2014)For the 2015 Oscars race, you were either team Birdman or team Boyhood. Richard Linklater's labour of love, shot intermittently over 12 years, ultimately failed to win.Universal PicturesOscars: 21 great films that never won Best PictureAmerican Honey (2016) If there's any justice, Andrea Arnold will one day become an Oscar winner, but in a perfect world, she would have already won for American Honey, a drama deserving of Best Picture if there ever was one.Universal PicturesOscars: 21 great films that never won Best PictureGet Out (2017)Horror rarely gets recognised at the Oscars, but Get Out is the closest the genre had come in years. Jordan Peele may have taken home the Best Original Screenplay award, but the stars aligned for Guillermo del Toro's fantasy The Shape of Water instead.Universal PicturesOscars: 21 great films that never won Best PictureRoma (2018)Roma was strongly expected to become the first ever foreign language film to win Best Picture. It had everything going for it, including a standout festival run and universal acclaim. But then Green Book snatched its trophy away in a late stage awards season twist that still seems too ridiculous to be true.Netflix Nolan vowed to “watch more Indian films in future,” stating: “I have had the pleasure of watching [Satyajit] Ray’s Pather Panchali recently, which I hadn’t seen before. I think it is one of the best films ever made. It is an extraordinary piece of work.

Precisely 60 years and one day prior, at the same institution, the world first met Apu. Pather Panchali, Satyajit Ray’s debut film, one of the most important works of world cinema and the first chapter in the Apu trilogy, had its world premiere at the Museum of Modern Art in New York on 3 May 1955. On 4 May 2015, Ray’s son Sandip, himself a film-maker, was on hand to present a new restoration of his late father’s most famous picture. Yet this was more than just a typical remastering. For decades, much of Ray’s work was mostly seen on chewed-up prints. After he was given an honorary lifetime achievement award at the 1992 Academy Awards, a push toward restoration was made. Ray’s negatives were sent to a lab in London, and then, tragedy. A fire destroyed the stock, and it looked like we would be left with nothing but those beat-up copies forever. There has never been a decent DVD version, let alone Blu-ray, of the Apu trilogy. But as Peter Becker, CEO of the Criterion Collection put it, “Sometimes not throwing something away is the most heroic thing you can do.” The technology now exists to restore and scan the original materials, even if they would “literally crumble in the can if you shook them too hard”. Only one lab, in Bologna, Italy, would attempt the rehydration process. As Becker put it, “No one else wanted to risk being the ones that destroyed this relic.” The result: gorgeous 4K digital prints with new subtitles. (I recall my one home viewing of Pather Panchali on a VHS so washed-out you could barely read the translated text.) Janus Films will distribute theatrical runs of all three movies at Film Forum in New York, followed by a national release at your finer art houses. Then, home releases via the Criterion Collection. First-time film-maker Ray, working with a mostly untested crew, had to partially self-finance the project, selling his collection of books while his wife pawned her jewellery. It’s quite in line with the bittersweet, neo-realistic story of its multi-generational Bengali family, always scraping by with some picked fruit from a neighbour’s garden or, in one scene, trading prized brass serving ware for pots of rice. The Museum of Modern Art weighs heavily in Apu’s origin story. In 1954, curator Monroe Wheeler was planning a series for the following year called Living Arts of India. There would be textiles, ornamental displays, concerts (Ali Akbar Khan), dance (Shanta Rao), and Wheeler decided, after seeing some initial shots that young Calcutta ad man Satyajit Ray had tested, that he would save room on the programme if Ray could deliver his film on time. John Huston, who was in India scouting for The Man Who Would Be King (a film he didn’t shoot for another two decades), checked in on Ray’s development and wired back to the MoMA that programming Pather Panchali was a wise decision. To hear his son tell it, Ray didn’t sleep for 10 days while finishing the film for his deadline. He brought the reels to the airport and fell asleep, slumped over the desk at the terminal. Unfortunately, there wasn’t enough time to get the subtitles burned-in, but the screening still went over gangbusters. It led to a showing at Cannes, where Ray won an award for Best Human Document, and it was the first Indian film to make a major impact on the arthouse circuit. For this new, risen-from-the-ashes version to screen at MoMA certainly had special resonance. (And there was no shortage of boldfaced names in attendance to pay their respects, like Wes Anderson, Jim Jarmusch, Laurie Anderson, Joel Coen, Ken Burns, Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach.) It was also a nice bonus to feel the rumbling subway at MoMA’s subterranean screening facilities while watching a movie that has a recurring motif of distant trains. At a post-screening reception, Becker explained how the Apu trilogy has long been something of a holy grail for him. “Ray is the least known and least respected icon of the golden age of arthouse cinema,” he said. “This fills a much needed, non-western gap.” While unlikely to delight filmgoers whose appetites rarely sway them from the superhero buffet, Pather Panchali (which translates to Song of the Little Road) is unquestionably worth all this effort. The adventures of observant little Apu and his rascally older sister Durga are both fascinating as a window on to a foreign world and, of course, still universal. It may be an old man lugging sweets through the jungle on foot, but the siblings act the same way kids still do when the ice cream van rolls on to the block. Fathers who yearn for a life in the theatre, but can’t quite make ends meet, are the same in 2015 New York as they were in 1955 Nischindipur. Ravi Shankar’s music is as enthralling as ever and the recurring images of the natural world are absolutely stunning. Of course, they always were, but now we can see for ourselves.

Aparajito … part of the trilogy Apur Sansar … concluding the trilogy Topics Most popular Film Back to top ", "", "", "", "", "", "Courtesy of Janus Films To live without seeing the films of the Indian director Satyajit Ray, said Akira Kurosawa in 1975, “means existing in the world without seeing the sun or the moon.” Though Ray was 11 years his junior, Kurosawa spoke of him that day in Moscow as a master. “I can never forget the excitement in my mind after seeing it,” he recalled of Ray’s debut Pather Panchali, 20 years after that film’s success at Cannes helped to usher in a new era of cinematic globalism—one that would eventually make it possible for a Japanese filmmaker to praise an Indian one in a speech being translated for a Russian audience. “It is the kind of cinema that flows with the serenity and nobility of a big river.” In 2015—now 60 years since Pather Panchali’s release—Kurosawa’s simple words remain the best Ray criticism I’ve heard and, really, all the recommendation his films require. Pather Panchali, along with its two sequels, Aparajito (1956) and The World of Apu (1959)—the three together are known as “the Apu Trilogy,” after their main character—has just been re-released by Janus Films in a pristine 4K restoration, to be made available in a Criterion Blu-ray set later this year. (The original negatives of all three films were burned in a film-lab fire in London in 1993, making the restoration process especially difficult.) If this trilogy comes anywhere near your town—it opened earlier this month for a run at New York’s Film Forum, with plans to spread to more U.S. cities through the summer—I can’t exhort you any more strongly to see it than Kurosawa already has. Do you really want to exist in the world without ever seeing the sun or the moon? Those analogies from nature—celestial bodies, a flowing river—are especially apt for the first film, Pather Panchali (the title translates as “song of the little road”), which takes place in a forested region of Bengal remote enough that even a glimpse of a passing train is a daylong hike away. The Roy family—the impecunious Brahmin scholar and would-be writer Harihar (Kanu Banerjee), his more practical wife Sarbajaya (Karuna Banerjee), and their mischievous daughter Durga (Shampa “Runki” Banerjee as a child, Uma Das Gupta as a teenager)—once owned an orchard but were forced to sell it out of financial need. Now, to Sarbajaya’s lasting shame, they must listen to the neighbor family who bought the land from them accuse their daughter of theft. Durga does steal a guava or two every now and then, usually to give as a gift to the beloved old woman she calls “Auntie” (the toothless and bent-backed Chunibala Devi—unlike most of the film’s cast, a professional actress whose stage and screen career dates back to India’s silent film days). As the recurring spats between Sarbajaya and Auntie make plain, the old lady is a homeless mendicant who moves from family to family, depending for survival on her neighbors’ mercy and her own skills at manipulation. When a son is born to the Roy family, Auntie helps pitch in with the hammock swinging and lullaby singing. The baby soon grows into our observant and high-spirited hero, Apu (played as a child by Subir Banerjee), who’s first glimpsed only as a single wide, dark eye, peering at us in close-up from beneath a blanket. Photo by Marc Riboud/Magnum Photos/Janus Films There’s nothing happenstance about the framing of that shot, or indeed, about anything Ray does with his nimble but modest camera. (The richly detailed black-and-white cinematography of all three films is by Subrata Mitra, who was only 21 when he began shooting Pather Panchali and had never before operated a movie camera.) By delaying Apu’s entry into the story for more than 20 minutes—and then introducing him with that one bright, screen-filling eye—Ray has first created a geographical, social, and familial context into which his protagonist will be born, then introduced into that world a new subjectivity that will become a proxy for the audience’s own. From behind those eyes we will experience not only the growth to adulthood of one man, but the development of a young and troubled nation. India had just declared its independence from English rule in 1947, in the same partition of colonial territory that had split Ray’s native region of Bengal into two parts, the Hindu western half belonging to India and the Muslim east to Pakistan. (One bloody revolutionary war later, East Bengal would become its own nation, Bangladesh.) The sutures of that historical wound still feel fresh in the Apu trilogy, which widens in geographic and political scope as it moves from the rural setting of Pather Panchali to the holy city of Benares (now called Varanasi) in Aparajito and finally, in The World of Apu, to the more cosmopolitan and capitalist milieu of Kolkata (formerly Calcutta), where the grown-up Apu moves to make his way. The trilogy is based on two novels by the Bengali novelist Bibhutibhusan Banerjee, and Ray’s regional and linguistic nationalism is always palpable without ever becoming explicit—it’s there, for example, in the lilting Bengali poetry Apu recites aloud on several occasions, first as a precocious schoolchild and years later as a young scholar drunk on the love of language (and liquor). My editor assured me that 60 years was enough time passed not to have to worry about “spoiling” the Apu Trilogy. But I still can’t bring myself to reveal much about the series’ twists and turns, because most of their pleasure and surprise come in the way Ray allows everyday life—with its daily disappointments, sudden tragedies and unplanned-for moments of delight—to unfold at a natural, unhurried pace, as if the movie itself were something that grew up out of the ground. “Auntie” is repeatedly kicked out of the Roys’ household for her mooching ways, only to shuffle back a few days later with her bundle of clothes in hand and toothless grin intact. The father disappears to the city for months to find work, leaving his anxious wife to hold the family together through a period of sickness and financial hardship. (In an era when the domestic experience of women was seldom the focus of films made in the West, Ray put Apu’s mother at the emotional center of Pather Panchali, and Karuna Banerjee’s quiet, anguished performance evokes some of the great actresses of melodrama: Lillian Gish, Ingrid Bergman, Anna Magnani.) The sequence in which Apu and his sister Durga set out for a long walk while monsoon season is approaching, pausing (along with the camera) to witness the delicate skimming of water bugs across the surface of a pond, brings to mind one of those moments in Hayao Miyazaki’s animated films when all human activity stops short to attend to the movement of nature. In these movies, time passes in a way that feels real—an effect that inspired generations of filmmakers even if, like Ray fans Kurosawa, Martin Scorsese, and Wes Anderson, they made very different movies from his. Courtesy of Janus Films In the second film of the trilogy, Aparajito, the adolescent Apu—played by two actors, first Pinaki Sengupta and later Smaran Ghosal—has become a promising student in Benares, where his father has found regular work as a lay Brahmin priest. Apu, still as wide-eyed and curious as when he first peeked out from that blanket, has begun to get a sense of the larger world outside his limited experience—a discovery symbolized by the small globe he carries around like a talisman. But a terrible loss forces the family to move yet again, and by the film’s end Apu has gone on his own to Calcutta to pursue his studies. In The World of Apu our hero, now played by Soumitra Chatterjee, is a penniless but passionate young man in his 20s, selling off books of English poetry to pay the rent on his one-room Calcutta flat while he works on an autobiographical novel. Through a turn of events that’s at once comic and horrifying, Apu finds himself in an arranged marriage to a young girl, Aparna (Sharmila Tagore), whom he barely knows and who knows even less about him. But gradually the two strangers begin to fall in love—a development signaled by a simple and wonderful transition in which the movement of a straw hand fan, wielded first by Aparna and then by Apu, signals both the passage of time and the growth of their shared affection. By the end of the third film, Apu has become such a full and complex being in the audience’s imagination that we see the whole story of his past—his loves, his losses, his unfixable mistakes—reflected in the face of Soumitra Chatterjee (who was a professional actor at the time Ray cast him, and who would go on to become one of the director’s most faithful collaborators). The watchful boy of Pather Panchali, looking out from under that blanket, has become the pensive man of The World of Apu, and there’s a direct, but never overemphasized, line of continuity between the 6-year-old wild with excitement about the rare arrival of a letter and the nearly 30-year-old scolded at work for mooning over a packet of love notes. The exquisite musical scores for all three films are by the sitar master Ravi Shankar—not yet a crossover success in the West in those pre-Beatles days but enough of a star on the Indian concert circuit that he only had time to record the first two soundtracks by improvising over the course of a single viewing. This gives those films’ musical backdrop the freshness of an improvised jazz score, like the one Miles Davis would record a few years later for Louis Malle’s Elevator to the Gallows. The World of Apu has a fuller, more orchestrated soundtrack, which matches well with the increasing ambition and amplitude of Ray’s cinematic technique. In between making the second and third films in the series, Ray had directed another, his 1958 masterpiece The Music Room, and the growth of his confidence as a filmmaker is evident alongside the development of his sensitive hero. The Apu Trilogy is often spoken of in terms of its debt to Italian neorealism—a style that certainly influenced Ray after he viewed Vittorio de Sica’s Bicycle Thieves (and, by his own count, 98 other films) during the three months he spent in London in 1950 working for an English advertising agency. But the Apu films have a lyricism, at times even an aching romanticism, that’s absent from the neorealists’ proletarian chronicles of postwar subsistence. In the space between tragic losses—at least one of which occurs in every film—and fleeting moments of intimacy and joy, there’s always time to stop and watch the water-skimmers, to hear a snatch of birdsong in the forest, or to declaim a few tipsy lines of verse to a friend as the two of you walk home along the train tracks after a night out. It’s these interstitial scenes that weave the events of Apu’s life into the viewer’s own memory, and stay with you—take my word on this one—through decades of your own such fleeting moments. In that same 1975 speech, Kurosawa marveled at the plenitude of the cinematic minicosmos Ray created in the Apu Trilogy: “People are born, live out their lives, and accept their deaths.” Don’t accept yours until you’ve seen these sublime restorations of the Apu movies on the big screen.

Advertisement Advertisement By the end of the third film, Apu has become such a full and complex being in the audience’s imagination that we see the whole story of his past—his loves, his losses, his unfixable mistakes—reflected in the face of Soumitra Chatterjee (who was a professional actor at the time Ray cast him, and who would go on to become one of the director’s most faithful collaborators). The watchful boy of Pather Panchali, looking out from under that blanket, has become the pensive man of The World of Apu, and there’s a direct, but never overemphasized, line of continuity between the 6-year-old wild with excitement about the rare arrival of a letter and the nearly 30-year-old scolded at work for mooning over a packet of love notes. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The exquisite musical scores for all three films are by the sitar master Ravi Shankar—not yet a crossover success in the West in those pre-Beatles days but enough of a star on the Indian concert circuit that he only had time to record the first two soundtracks by improvising over the course of a single viewing. This gives those films’ musical backdrop the freshness of an improvised jazz score, like the one Miles Davis would record a few years later for Louis Malle’s Elevator to the Gallows. The World of Apu has a fuller, more orchestrated soundtrack, which matches well with the increasing ambition and amplitude of Ray’s cinematic technique. In between making the second and third films in the series, Ray had directed another, his 1958 masterpiece The Music Room, and the growth of his confidence as a filmmaker is evident alongside the development of his sensitive hero. Advertisement Advertisement The Apu Trilogy is often spoken of in terms of its debt to Italian neorealism—a style that certainly influenced Ray after he viewed Vittorio de Sica’s Bicycle Thieves (and, by his own count, 98 other films) during the three months he spent in London in 1950 working for an English advertising agency. But the Apu films have a lyricism, at times even an aching romanticism, that’s absent from the neorealists’ proletarian chronicles of postwar subsistence. In the space between tragic losses—at least one of which occurs in every film—and fleeting moments of intimacy and joy, there’s always time to stop and watch the water-skimmers, to hear a snatch of birdsong in the forest, or to declaim a few tipsy lines of verse to a friend as the two of you walk home along the train tracks after a night out. It’s these interstitial scenes that weave the events of Apu’s life into the viewer’s own memory, and stay with you—take my word on this one—through decades of your own such fleeting moments. In that same 1975 speech, Kurosawa marveled at the plenitude of the cinematic minicosmos Ray created in the Apu Trilogy: “People are born, live out their lives, and accept their deaths.” Don’t accept yours until you’ve seen these sublime restorations of the Apu movies on the big screen.

Courtesy of Janus Films Share", "Courtesy of Janus Films To live without seeing the films of the Indian director Satyajit Ray, said Akira Kurosawa in 1975, “means existing in the world without seeing the sun or the moon.” Though Ray was 11 years his junior, Kurosawa spoke of him that day in Moscow as a master. “I can never forget the excitement in my mind after seeing it,” he recalled of Ray’s debut Pather Panchali, 20 years after that film’s success at Cannes helped to usher in a new era of cinematic globalism—one that would eventually make it possible for a Japanese filmmaker to praise an Indian one in a speech being translated for a Russian audience. “It is the kind of cinema that flows with the serenity and nobility of a big river.” Dana Stevens is Slate’s movie critic. In 2015—now 60 years since Pather Panchali’s release—Kurosawa’s simple words remain the best Ray criticism I’ve heard and, really, all the recommendation his films require. Pather Panchali, along with its two sequels, Aparajito (1956) and The World of Apu (1959)—the three together are known as “the Apu Trilogy,” after their main character—has just been re-released by Janus Films in a pristine 4K restoration, to be made available in a Criterion Blu-ray set later this year. (The original negatives of all three films were burned in a film-lab fire in London in 1993, making the restoration process especially difficult.) If this trilogy comes anywhere near your town—it opened earlier this month for a run at New York’s Film Forum, with plans to spread to more U.S. cities through the summer—I can’t exhort you any more strongly to see it than Kurosawa already has. Do you really want to exist in the world without ever seeing the sun or the moon? Those analogies from nature—celestial bodies, a flowing river—are especially apt for the first film, Pather Panchali (the title translates as “song of the little road”), which takes place in a forested region of Bengal remote enough that even a glimpse of a passing train is a daylong hike away. The Roy family—the impecunious Brahmin scholar and would-be writer Harihar (Kanu Banerjee), his more practical wife Sarbajaya (Karuna Banerjee), and their mischievous daughter Durga (Shampa “Runki” Banerjee as a child, Uma Das Gupta as a teenager)—once owned an orchard but were forced to sell it out of financial need. Now, to Sarbajaya’s lasting shame, they must listen to the neighbor family who bought the land from them accuse their daughter of theft. Durga does steal a guava or two every now and then, usually to give as a gift to the beloved old woman she calls “Auntie” (the toothless and bent-backed Chunibala Devi—unlike most of the film’s cast, a professional actress whose stage and screen career dates back to India’s silent film days). As the recurring spats between Sarbajaya and Auntie make plain, the old lady is a homeless mendicant who moves from family to family, depending for survival on her neighbors’ mercy and her own skills at manipulation. When a son is born to the Roy family, Auntie helps pitch in with the hammock swinging and lullaby singing. The baby soon grows into our observant and high-spirited hero, Apu (played as a child by Subir Banerjee), who’s first glimpsed only as a single wide, dark eye, peering at us in close-up from beneath a blanket. Photo by Marc Riboud/Magnum Photos/Janus Films There’s nothing happenstance about the framing of that shot, or indeed, about anything Ray does with his nimble but modest camera. (The richly detailed black-and-white cinematography of all three films is by Subrata Mitra, who was only 21 when he began shooting Pather Panchali and had never before operated a movie camera.) By delaying Apu’s entry into the story for more than 20 minutes—and then introducing him with that one bright, screen-filling eye—Ray has first created a geographical, social, and familial context into which his protagonist will be born, then introduced into that world a new subjectivity that will become a proxy for the audience’s own. From behind those eyes we will experience not only the growth to adulthood of one man, but the development of a young and troubled nation. India had just declared its independence from English rule in 1947, in the same partition of colonial territory that had split Ray’s native region of Bengal into two parts, the Hindu western half belonging to India and the Muslim east to Pakistan. (One bloody revolutionary war later, East Bengal would become its own nation, Bangladesh.) The sutures of that historical wound still feel fresh in the Apu trilogy, which widens in geographic and political scope as it moves from the rural setting of Pather Panchali to the holy city of Benares (now called Varanasi) in Aparajito and finally, in The World of Apu, to the more cosmopolitan and capitalist milieu of Kolkata (formerly Calcutta), where the grown-up Apu moves to make his way. The trilogy is based on two novels by the Bengali novelist Bibhutibhusan Banerjee, and Ray’s regional and linguistic nationalism is always palpable without ever becoming explicit—it’s there, for example, in the lilting Bengali poetry Apu recites aloud on several occasions, first as a precocious schoolchild and years later as a young scholar drunk on the love of language (and liquor). My editor assured me that 60 years was enough time passed not to have to worry about “spoiling” the Apu Trilogy. But I still can’t bring myself to reveal much about the series’ twists and turns, because most of their pleasure and surprise come in the way Ray allows everyday life—with its daily disappointments, sudden tragedies and unplanned-for moments of delight—to unfold at a natural, unhurried pace, as if the movie itself were something that grew up out of the ground. “Auntie” is repeatedly kicked out of the Roys’ household for her mooching ways, only to shuffle back a few days later with her bundle of clothes in hand and toothless grin intact. The father disappears to the city for months to find work, leaving his anxious wife to hold the family together through a period of sickness and financial hardship. (In an era when the domestic experience of women was seldom the focus of films made in the West, Ray put Apu’s mother at the emotional center of Pather Panchali, and Karuna Banerjee’s quiet, anguished performance evokes some of the great actresses of melodrama: Lillian Gish, Ingrid Bergman, Anna Magnani.) The sequence in which Apu and his sister Durga set out for a long walk while monsoon season is approaching, pausing (along with the camera) to witness the delicate skimming of water bugs across the surface of a pond, brings to mind one of those moments in Hayao Miyazaki’s animated films when all human activity stops short to attend to the movement of nature. In these movies, time passes in a way that feels real—an effect that inspired generations of filmmakers even if, like Ray fans Kurosawa, Martin Scorsese, and Wes Anderson, they made very different movies from his. Courtesy of Janus Films In the second film of the trilogy, Aparajito, the adolescent Apu—played by two actors, first Pinaki Sengupta and later Smaran Ghosal—has become a promising student in Benares, where his father has found regular work as a lay Brahmin priest. Apu, still as wide-eyed and curious as when he first peeked out from that blanket, has begun to get a sense of the larger world outside his limited experience—a discovery symbolized by the small globe he carries around like a talisman. But a terrible loss forces the family to move yet again, and by the film’s end Apu has gone on his own to Calcutta to pursue his studies. In The World of Apu our hero, now played by Soumitra Chatterjee, is a penniless but passionate young man in his 20s, selling off books of English poetry to pay the rent on his one-room Calcutta flat while he works on an autobiographical novel. Through a turn of events that’s at once comic and horrifying, Apu finds himself in an arranged marriage to a young girl, Aparna (Sharmila Tagore), whom he barely knows and who knows even less about him.

Standing above fashion, it creates a world so convincing that it becomes, for a time, another life we might have lived.\" Roger Ebert wrote that about \"The Apu Trilogy\" when he inducted the films into his Great Movies pantheon in 2001, and we're reminded of this truth with the recent 4K restorations of Satyajit Ray's essential work. Few films are more beloved or more influential than \"Pather Panchali\", \"Aparajito\", and \"The World of Apu\", which have recently been lovingly, remarkably restored after a nitrate fire burned the originals over two decades ago. Now in theaters in New York City and soon making their way around the country, Ray's films have that remarkable ability to transcend time. They will always matter. They will always be important. They will always define what Roger spoke so eloquently about when he envisioned film as an empathy machine, a way to step into another person's life. Watching them again in 2015, Satyajit Ray's films simulataneously transport us to a world not directly like our own and do so with enough relatable human emotion that we see ourselves in it. It is not only another life we might have lived but a reflection of our own. It was 1992 when the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences chose to give Ray a Lifetime Achievement Oscar. The producers of the telecast were dismayed at the poor quality of the available prints for the montage and set out to restore Ray's films. The next year, they shipped original negatives, including those of \"The Apu Trilogy\" to London. Tragedy struck when a nitrate fire spread from a lab to the vaults, burning a few dozen films, including Ray's. What remained was sent to the Academy Film Archive, but the prognosis was dire. They were deemed unsalvageable at the time and it really looked like we might lose \"The Apu Trilogy\" forever. Well, technology improves. And, in 2013, the Criterion Collection began an exhaustive project with the Academy Film Archive, transporting the materials that remained to L'Immagine Ritrovata in Bologna. Working delicately with the damaged materials, technicians developed a special solution to rehydrate what they could, physically repairing the film over thousands of hours of careful work. Duplicate negatives from the Academy, the Harvard Film Archive, the British Film Institute, and Janus Films filled in any blanks left by frames that were burned to ash in '93. According to Janus, 40% of \"Pather Panchali\" and over 60% of \"Aparajito\" now consists of original negative. The incredible effort can be seen right there on the screen (at the Film Forum in NYC for the next few weeks before coming to other markets and, one presumes, Blu-ray later this year). The films reveal almost no visual degradation. Occassionally, the picture will jump as if a few frames are missing, but it's hard to believe that these aren't remasters from original material through and through. It's also impossible to watch \"The Apu Trilogy\" and not consider its place in film history. The Criterion Collection recently released Jean Renoir's \"The River,\" a film that has an undeniable influence on Ray in that he met Renoir when it was filming in India. He also met Subrata Mitra, a production assistant of Renoir's, who would go on to shoot \"The Apu Trilogy,\" conveying in Ray's films much of the cinematic river of life approach seen in Renoir's. And the list of films and filmmakers influenced by Ray's is too lengthy to even consider. Martin Scorsese once said about Ray, \"Without a doubt, in his films the line between poetry and cinema, dissolved.\" To say that Ray's cinematic poetry has \"held up\" would be a ridiculous understatement. Like Ozu's \"Tokyo Story\", there's a timeless quality to \"Pather Panchali\" that's mesmerizing. Without forced melodrama, Apu's family very quickly becomes ours. The primary forces that shape Apu's life are essential to humanity whether they be as primal as hunger or as coveted as the love of family. This is humanity. It will always matter. And Ray's ability to turn that human essence into art shouldn't be underrated. It's not just the themes of \"The Apu Trilogy\" but how they're conveyed. Just look at the choice of camera position in \"Pather\". Children like Apu and Durga are often shot from above, eyes upward at adults and the brave new world that fascinates them. Adults, especially those outside of the family, are shot from below, visually giving people like Sarbajaya the towering power of a matriarch. Durga, one of the most endearing characters in the Apu films, is a little thief who grows up to be a mindful, solemnly beautiful young lady. Even when she isn't present onscreen, her spirit lingers across the three films in this saga of poor but loving family. There are echoes of her behavior, impish, sweet and compassionate, everywhere in the trilogy. She is the best in us, our loving and adventurous nature. There isn't much new to say about a series that many consider like a loved one, except that they feel new each time—precisely the feeling of wonder and fluttering anticipation you feel when going to meet someone you adore. Apu, his sister Durga, his father Harihar and his mother Sarbajaya haven't aged a day, and the particulars of their story continue to yield astonishing surprises. For example: A friend observed that these films are really all about Apu's mother. There's much evidence to support her claim. So many shots linger upon Sarbajaya mentally weighing the fate of her family against the demands of survival, making decisions that no one else considers but which save them from disaster for another day, at least. Ray records these sacrifices in appropriately reverential way that, this time around, made me think of the first shot of Xavier Dolan's \"Mommy\", in which the camera hovers over the title character, a widower raising a volatile son, as she basks in sunlight—an adoring, sanctifying gesture on the filmmaker's part. This kind of courtly attention to poor, struggling characters can be devastatingly beautiful in a certain context. Here in America, the context is often one of shame and silence regarding the poor. Even in sympathy, the camera tends to glance condescendingly, offering up so little evidence of an individual. In \"Pather Panchali,\" we learn very little about Sarbajaya's past or her dreams, but we get ample time and space to consider them, to see her as we might see our own mother, or ourselves. European and American films helped Ray figure how to convey these moments in an exciting way, but he refined the approach, arguably applying more patience and restraint (particularly in the lighting) than his heroes, Ford, Renoir, De Sica. As a result, it's hard to accept that Karuna Banerjee as Sarbajaya was not among the non-professional cast members but, in fact, a seasoned actress; that we are not watching, in some sense, a documentary. The same goes for the rest of the family. Ray's manner of passing time with them lets them settle in our thoughts as something more than characters. What they do and what happens to them registers with more force yet with less noise than that of a typical drama of the time—in any country. When Harihar, a gentle and decent man of faith, appears out of a crowd of strangers in the beginning of \"Aparajito,\" my heart leaps every time. My friend is back! What's he been up to? How has life been treating him since we last passed the time together? Ray knows that anyone who has watched \"Pather Panchali\" will patiently await the answers, a return on the investment. Apu, of course, is with us for the duration. We attend his birth, his childhood, his coming of age and his unique but (emotionally) universal initiation into manhood. There is much silence and stillness along the way, but never a dull moment. The artfully mixed natural sounds and the music of Ravi Shankar are a river that Apu navigates. The boat is the camera that cinematographer Subrata Mita pilots. Dulal Dutta's editing sends it along the story's tributaries, channels and deltas with a flow modern filmmakers have simply forgotten. When we are left on the bank by the end of it and must let Apu sail on, there is no time for sadness. We walk away with a gift, a keepsake for a lifetime.

With themes rooted with universal appeal and understanding we see the pain and tragedy, familial spirit and hands on tutelage of one expressively insignificant individual in our world.

Precisely 60 years and one day prior, at the same institution, the world first met Apu. Pather Panchali, Satyajit Ray’s debut film, one of the most important works of world cinema and the first chapter in the Apu trilogy, had its world premiere at the Museum of Modern Art in New York on 3 May 1955. On 4 May 2015, Ray’s son Sandip, himself a film-maker, was on hand to present a new restoration of his late father’s most famous picture. Yet this was more than just a typical remastering. For decades, much of Ray’s work was mostly seen on chewed-up prints. After he was given an honorary lifetime achievement award at the 1992 Academy Awards, a push toward restoration was made. Ray’s negatives were sent to a lab in London, and then, tragedy. A fire destroyed the stock, and it looked like we would be left with nothing but those beat-up copies forever. There has never been a decent DVD version, let alone Blu-ray, of the Apu trilogy. But as Peter Becker, CEO of the Criterion Collection put it, “Sometimes not throwing something away is the most heroic thing you can do.” The technology now exists to restore and scan the original materials, even if they would “literally crumble in the can if you shook them too hard”. Only one lab, in Bologna, Italy, would attempt the rehydration process. As Becker put it, “No one else wanted to risk being the ones that destroyed this relic.” The result: gorgeous 4K digital prints with new subtitles. (I recall my one home viewing of Pather Panchali on a VHS so washed-out you could barely read the translated text.) Janus Films will distribute theatrical runs of all three movies at Film Forum in New York, followed by a national release at your finer art houses. Then, home releases via the Criterion Collection. First-time film-maker Ray, working with a mostly untested crew, had to partially self-finance the project, selling his collection of books while his wife pawned her jewellery. It’s quite in line with the bittersweet, neo-realistic story of its multi-generational Bengali family, always scraping by with some picked fruit from a neighbour’s garden or, in one scene, trading prized brass serving ware for pots of rice. The Museum of Modern Art weighs heavily in Apu’s origin story. In 1954, curator Monroe Wheeler was planning a series for the following year called Living Arts of India. There would be textiles, ornamental displays, concerts (Ali Akbar Khan), dance (Shanta Rao), and Wheeler decided, after seeing some initial shots that young Calcutta ad man Satyajit Ray had tested, that he would save room on the programme if Ray could deliver his film on time. John Huston, who was in India scouting for The Man Who Would Be King (a film he didn’t shoot for another two decades), checked in on Ray’s development and wired back to the MoMA that programming Pather Panchali was a wise decision. To hear his son tell it, Ray didn’t sleep for 10 days while finishing the film for his deadline. He brought the reels to the airport and fell asleep, slumped over the desk at the terminal. Unfortunately, there wasn’t enough time to get the subtitles burned-in, but the screening still went over gangbusters. It led to a showing at Cannes, where Ray won an award for Best Human Document, and it was the first Indian film to make a major impact on the arthouse circuit. For this new, risen-from-the-ashes version to screen at MoMA certainly had special resonance. (And there was no shortage of boldfaced names in attendance to pay their respects, like Wes Anderson, Jim Jarmusch, Laurie Anderson, Joel Coen, Ken Burns, Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach.) It was also a nice bonus to feel the rumbling subway at MoMA’s subterranean screening facilities while watching a movie that has a recurring motif of distant trains. At a post-screening reception, Becker explained how the Apu trilogy has long been something of a holy grail for him. “Ray is the least known and least respected icon of the golden age of arthouse cinema,” he said. “This fills a much needed, non-western gap.” While unlikely to delight filmgoers whose appetites rarely sway them from the superhero buffet, Pather Panchali (which translates to Song of the Little Road) is unquestionably worth all this effort. The adventures of observant little Apu and his rascally older sister Durga are both fascinating as a window on to a foreign world and, of course, still universal. It may be an old man lugging sweets through the jungle on foot, but the siblings act the same way kids still do when the ice cream van rolls on to the block. Fathers who yearn for a life in the theatre, but can’t quite make ends meet, are the same in 2015 New York as they were in 1955 Nischindipur. Ravi Shankar’s music is as enthralling as ever and the recurring images of the natural world are absolutely stunning. Of course, they always were, but now we can see for ourselves.

Aparajito … part of the trilogy Apur Sansar … concluding the trilogy Topics Most popular Film Back to top ", "", "", "", "", "", "Courtesy of Janus Films To live without seeing the films of the Indian director Satyajit Ray, said Akira Kurosawa in 1975, “means existing in the world without seeing the sun or the moon.” Though Ray was 11 years his junior, Kurosawa spoke of him that day in Moscow as a master. “I can never forget the excitement in my mind after seeing it,” he recalled of Ray’s debut Pather Panchali, 20 years after that film’s success at Cannes helped to usher in a new era of cinematic globalism—one that would eventually make it possible for a Japanese filmmaker to praise an Indian one in a speech being translated for a Russian audience. “It is the kind of cinema that flows with the serenity and nobility of a big river.” In 2015—now 60 years since Pather Panchali’s release—Kurosawa’s simple words remain the best Ray criticism I’ve heard and, really, all the recommendation his films require. Pather Panchali, along with its two sequels, Aparajito (1956) and The World of Apu (1959)—the three together are known as “the Apu Trilogy,” after their main character—has just been re-released by Janus Films in a pristine 4K restoration, to be made available in a Criterion Blu-ray set later this year. (The original negatives of all three films were burned in a film-lab fire in London in 1993, making the restoration process especially difficult.) If this trilogy comes anywhere near your town—it opened earlier this month for a run at New York’s Film Forum, with plans to spread to more U.S. cities through the summer—I can’t exhort you any more strongly to see it than Kurosawa already has. Do you really want to exist in the world without ever seeing the sun or the moon? Those analogies from nature—celestial bodies, a flowing river—are especially apt for the first film, Pather Panchali (the title translates as “song of the little road”), which takes place in a forested region of Bengal remote enough that even a glimpse of a passing train is a daylong hike away. The Roy family—the impecunious Brahmin scholar and would-be writer Harihar (Kanu Banerjee), his more practical wife Sarbajaya (Karuna Banerjee), and their mischievous daughter Durga (Shampa “Runki” Banerjee as a child, Uma Das Gupta as a teenager)—once owned an orchard but were forced to sell it out of financial need. Now, to Sarbajaya’s lasting shame, they must listen to the neighbor family who bought the land from them accuse their daughter of theft. Durga does steal a guava or two every now and then, usually to give as a gift to the beloved old woman she calls “Auntie” (the toothless and bent-backed Chunibala Devi—unlike most of the film’s cast, a professional actress whose stage and screen career dates back to India’s silent film days). As the recurring spats between Sarbajaya and Auntie make plain, the old lady is a homeless mendicant who moves from family to family, depending for survival on her neighbors’ mercy and her own skills at manipulation. When a son is born to the Roy family, Auntie helps pitch in with the hammock swinging and lullaby singing. The baby soon grows into our observant and high-spirited hero, Apu (played as a child by Subir Banerjee), who’s first glimpsed only as a single wide, dark eye, peering at us in close-up from beneath a blanket. Photo by Marc Riboud/Magnum Photos/Janus Films There’s nothing happenstance about the framing of that shot, or indeed, about anything Ray does with his nimble but modest camera. (The richly detailed black-and-white cinematography of all three films is by Subrata Mitra, who was only 21 when he began shooting Pather Panchali and had never before operated a movie camera.) By delaying Apu’s entry into the story for more than 20 minutes—and then introducing him with that one bright, screen-filling eye—Ray has first created a geographical, social, and familial context into which his protagonist will be born, then introduced into that world a new subjectivity that will become a proxy for the audience’s own. From behind those eyes we will experience not only the growth to adulthood of one man, but the development of a young and troubled nation. India had just declared its independence from English rule in 1947, in the same partition of colonial territory that had split Ray’s native region of Bengal into two parts, the Hindu western half belonging to India and the Muslim east to Pakistan. (One bloody revolutionary war later, East Bengal would become its own nation, Bangladesh.) The sutures of that historical wound still feel fresh in the Apu trilogy, which widens in geographic and political scope as it moves from the rural setting of Pather Panchali to the holy city of Benares (now called Varanasi) in Aparajito and finally, in The World of Apu, to the more cosmopolitan and capitalist milieu of Kolkata (formerly Calcutta), where the grown-up Apu moves to make his way. The trilogy is based on two novels by the Bengali novelist Bibhutibhusan Banerjee, and Ray’s regional and linguistic nationalism is always palpable without ever becoming explicit—it’s there, for example, in the lilting Bengali poetry Apu recites aloud on several occasions, first as a precocious schoolchild and years later as a young scholar drunk on the love of language (and liquor). My editor assured me that 60 years was enough time passed not to have to worry about “spoiling” the Apu Trilogy. But I still can’t bring myself to reveal much about the series’ twists and turns, because most of their pleasure and surprise come in the way Ray allows everyday life—with its daily disappointments, sudden tragedies and unplanned-for moments of delight—to unfold at a natural, unhurried pace, as if the movie itself were something that grew up out of the ground. “Auntie” is repeatedly kicked out of the Roys’ household for her mooching ways, only to shuffle back a few days later with her bundle of clothes in hand and toothless grin intact. The father disappears to the city for months to find work, leaving his anxious wife to hold the family together through a period of sickness and financial hardship. (In an era when the domestic experience of women was seldom the focus of films made in the West, Ray put Apu’s mother at the emotional center of Pather Panchali, and Karuna Banerjee’s quiet, anguished performance evokes some of the great actresses of melodrama: Lillian Gish, Ingrid Bergman, Anna Magnani.) The sequence in which Apu and his sister Durga set out for a long walk while monsoon season is approaching, pausing (along with the camera) to witness the delicate skimming of water bugs across the surface of a pond, brings to mind one of those moments in Hayao Miyazaki’s animated films when all human activity stops short to attend to the movement of nature. In these movies, time passes in a way that feels real—an effect that inspired generations of filmmakers even if, like Ray fans Kurosawa, Martin Scorsese, and Wes Anderson, they made very different movies from his. Courtesy of Janus Films In the second film of the trilogy, Aparajito, the adolescent Apu—played by two actors, first Pinaki Sengupta and later Smaran Ghosal—has become a promising student in Benares, where his father has found regular work as a lay Brahmin priest. Apu, still as wide-eyed and curious as when he first peeked out from that blanket, has begun to get a sense of the larger world outside his limited experience—a discovery symbolized by the small globe he carries around like a talisman. But a terrible loss forces the family to move yet again, and by the film’s end Apu has gone on his own to Calcutta to pursue his studies. In The World of Apu our hero, now played by Soumitra Chatterjee, is a penniless but passionate young man in his 20s, selling off books of English poetry to pay the rent on his one-room Calcutta flat while he works on an autobiographical novel. Through a turn of events that’s at once comic and horrifying, Apu finds himself in an arranged marriage to a young girl, Aparna (Sharmila Tagore), whom he barely knows and who knows even less about him. But gradually the two strangers begin to fall in love—a development signaled by a simple and wonderful transition in which the movement of a straw hand fan, wielded first by Aparna and then by Apu, signals both the passage of time and the growth of their shared affection. By the end of the third film, Apu has become such a full and complex being in the audience’s imagination that we see the whole story of his past—his loves, his losses, his unfixable mistakes—reflected in the face of Soumitra Chatterjee (who was a professional actor at the time Ray cast him, and who would go on to become one of the director’s most faithful collaborators). The watchful boy of Pather Panchali, looking out from under that blanket, has become the pensive man of The World of Apu, and there’s a direct, but never overemphasized, line of continuity between the 6-year-old wild with excitement about the rare arrival of a letter and the nearly 30-year-old scolded at work for mooning over a packet of love notes. The exquisite musical scores for all three films are by the sitar master Ravi Shankar—not yet a crossover success in the West in those pre-Beatles days but enough of a star on the Indian concert circuit that he only had time to record the first two soundtracks by improvising over the course of a single viewing. This gives those films’ musical backdrop the freshness of an improvised jazz score, like the one Miles Davis would record a few years later for Louis Malle’s Elevator to the Gallows. The World of Apu has a fuller, more orchestrated soundtrack, which matches well with the increasing ambition and amplitude of Ray’s cinematic technique. In between making the second and third films in the series, Ray had directed another, his 1958 masterpiece The Music Room, and the growth of his confidence as a filmmaker is evident alongside the development of his sensitive hero. The Apu Trilogy is often spoken of in terms of its debt to Italian neorealism—a style that certainly influenced Ray after he viewed Vittorio de Sica’s Bicycle Thieves (and, by his own count, 98 other films) during the three months he spent in London in 1950 working for an English advertising agency. But the Apu films have a lyricism, at times even an aching romanticism, that’s absent from the neorealists’ proletarian chronicles of postwar subsistence. In the space between tragic losses—at least one of which occurs in every film—and fleeting moments of intimacy and joy, there’s always time to stop and watch the water-skimmers, to hear a snatch of birdsong in the forest, or to declaim a few tipsy lines of verse to a friend as the two of you walk home along the train tracks after a night out. It’s these interstitial scenes that weave the events of Apu’s life into the viewer’s own memory, and stay with you—take my word on this one—through decades of your own such fleeting moments. In that same 1975 speech, Kurosawa marveled at the plenitude of the cinematic minicosmos Ray created in the Apu Trilogy: “People are born, live out their lives, and accept their deaths.” Don’t accept yours until you’ve seen these sublime restorations of the Apu movies on the big screen.

As the recurring spats between Sarbajaya and Auntie make plain, the old lady is a homeless mendicant who moves from family to family, depending for survival on her neighbors’ mercy and her own skills at manipulation. When a son is born to the Roy family, Auntie helps pitch in with the hammock swinging and lullaby singing. The baby soon grows into our observant and high-spirited hero, Apu (played as a child by Subir Banerjee), who’s first glimpsed only as a single wide, dark eye, peering at us in close-up from beneath a blanket.

Photo by Marc Riboud/Magnum Photos/Janus Films There’s nothing happenstance about the framing of that shot, or indeed, about anything Ray does with his nimble but modest camera. (The richly detailed black-and-white cinematography of all three films is by Subrata Mitra, who was only 21 when he began shooting Pather Panchali and had never before operated a movie camera.) By delaying Apu’s entry into the story for more than 20 minutes—and then introducing him with that one bright, screen-filling eye—Ray has first created a geographical, social, and familial context into which his protagonist will be born, then introduced into that world a new subjectivity that will become a proxy for the audience’s own. From behind those eyes we will experience not only the growth to adulthood of one man, but the development of a young and troubled nation. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement India had just declared its independence from English rule in 1947, in the same partition of colonial territory that had split Ray’s native region of Bengal into two parts, the Hindu western half belonging to India and the Muslim east to Pakistan. (One bloody revolutionary war later, East Bengal would become its own nation, Bangladesh.) The sutures of that historical wound still feel fresh in the Apu trilogy, which widens in geographic and political scope as it moves from the rural setting of Pather Panchali to the holy city of Benares (now called Varanasi) in Aparajito and finally, in The World of Apu, to the more cosmopolitan and capitalist milieu of Kolkata (formerly Calcutta), where the grown-up Apu moves to make his way. The trilogy is based on two novels by the Bengali novelist Bibhutibhusan Banerjee, and Ray’s regional and linguistic nationalism is always palpable without ever becoming explicit—it’s there, for example, in the lilting Bengali poetry Apu recites aloud on several occasions, first as a precocious schoolchild and years later as a young scholar drunk on the love of language (and liquor). Advertisement Advertisement My editor assured me that 60 years was enough time passed not to have to worry about “spoiling” the Apu Trilogy. But I still can’t bring myself to reveal much about the series’ twists and turns, because most of their pleasure and surprise come in the way Ray allows everyday life—with its daily disappointments, sudden tragedies and unplanned-for moments of delight—to unfold at a natural, unhurried pace, as if the movie itself were something that grew up out of the ground. “Auntie” is repeatedly kicked out of the Roys’ household for her mooching ways, only to shuffle back a few days later with her bundle of clothes in hand and toothless grin intact. The father disappears to the city for months to find work, leaving his anxious wife to hold the family together through a period of sickness and financial hardship. (In an era when the domestic experience of women was seldom the focus of films made in the West, Ray put Apu’s mother at the emotional center of Pather Panchali, and Karuna Banerjee’s quiet, anguished performance evokes some of the great actresses of melodrama: Lillian Gish, Ingrid Bergman, Anna Magnani.) The sequence in which Apu and his sister Durga set out for a long walk while monsoon season is approaching, pausing (along with the camera) to witness the delicate skimming of water bugs across the surface of a pond, brings to mind one of those moments in Hayao Miyazaki’s animated films when all human activity stops short to attend to the movement of nature. In these movies, time passes in a way that feels real—an effect that inspired generations of filmmakers even if, like Ray fans Kurosawa, Martin Scorsese, and Wes Anderson, they made very different movies from his.

Courtesy of Janus Films Advertisement Advertisement In the second film of the trilogy, Aparajito, the adolescent Apu—played by two actors, first Pinaki Sengupta and later Smaran Ghosal—has become a promising student in Benares, where his father has found regular work as a lay Brahmin priest. Apu, still as wide-eyed and curious as when he first peeked out from that blanket, has begun to get a sense of the larger world outside his limited experience—a discovery symbolized by the small globe he carries around like a talisman. But a terrible loss forces the family to move yet again, and by the film’s end Apu has gone on his own to Calcutta to pursue his studies. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement In The World of Apu our hero, now played by Soumitra Chatterjee, is a penniless but passionate young man in his 20s, selling off books of English poetry to pay the rent on his one-room Calcutta flat while he works on an autobiographical novel. Through a turn of events that’s at once comic and horrifying, Apu finds himself in an arranged marriage to a young girl, Aparna (Sharmila Tagore), whom he barely knows and who knows even less about him. But gradually the two strangers begin to fall in love—a development signaled by a simple and wonderful transition in which the movement of a straw hand fan, wielded first by Aparna and then by Apu, signals both the passage of time and the growth of their shared affection. Advertisement Advertisement By the end of the third film, Apu has become such a full and complex being in the audience’s imagination that we see the whole story of his past—his loves, his losses, his unfixable mistakes—reflected in the face of Soumitra Chatterjee (who was a professional actor at the time Ray cast him, and who would go on to become one of the director’s most faithful collaborators). The watchful boy of Pather Panchali, looking out from under that blanket, has become the pensive man of The World of Apu, and there’s a direct, but never overemphasized, line of continuity between the 6-year-old wild with excitement about the rare arrival of a letter and the nearly 30-year-old scolded at work for mooning over a packet of love notes. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The exquisite musical scores for all three films are by the sitar master Ravi Shankar—not yet a crossover success in the West in those pre-Beatles days but enough of a star on the Indian concert circuit that he only had time to record the first two soundtracks by improvising over the course of a single viewing. This gives those films’ musical backdrop the freshness of an improvised jazz score, like the one Miles Davis would record a few years later for Louis Malle’s Elevator to the Gallows. The World of Apu has a fuller, more orchestrated soundtrack, which matches well with the increasing ambition and amplitude of Ray’s cinematic technique. In between making the second and third films in the series, Ray had directed another, his 1958 masterpiece The Music Room, and the growth of his confidence as a filmmaker is evident alongside the development of his sensitive hero. Advertisement Advertisement The Apu Trilogy is often spoken of in terms of its debt to Italian neorealism—a style that certainly influenced Ray after he viewed Vittorio de Sica’s Bicycle Thieves (and, by his own count, 98 other films) during the three months he spent in London in 1950 working for an English advertising agency. But the Apu films have a lyricism, at times even an aching romanticism, that’s absent from the neorealists’ proletarian chronicles of postwar subsistence. In the space between tragic losses—at least one of which occurs in every film—and fleeting moments of intimacy and joy, there’s always time to stop and watch the water-skimmers, to hear a snatch of birdsong in the forest, or to declaim a few tipsy lines of verse to a friend as the two of you walk home along the train tracks after a night out. It’s these interstitial scenes that weave the events of Apu’s life into the viewer’s own memory, and stay with you—take my word on this one—through decades of your own such fleeting moments. In that same 1975 speech, Kurosawa marveled at the plenitude of the cinematic minicosmos Ray created in the Apu Trilogy: “People are born, live out their lives, and accept their deaths.” Don’t accept yours until you’ve seen these sublime restorations of the Apu movies on the big screen.

Courtesy of Janus Films Share", "Courtesy of Janus Films To live without seeing the films of the Indian director Satyajit Ray, said Akira Kurosawa in 1975, “means existing in the world without seeing the sun or the moon.” Though Ray was 11 years his junior, Kurosawa spoke of him that day in Moscow as a master. “I can never forget the excitement in my mind after seeing it,” he recalled of Ray’s debut Pather Panchali, 20 years after that film’s success at Cannes helped to usher in a new era of cinematic globalism—one that would eventually make it possible for a Japanese filmmaker to praise an Indian one in a speech being translated for a Russian audience. “It is the kind of cinema that flows with the serenity and nobility of a big river.” Dana Stevens is Slate’s movie critic. In 2015—now 60 years since Pather Panchali’s release—Kurosawa’s simple words remain the best Ray criticism I’ve heard and, really, all the recommendation his films require. Pather Panchali, along with its two sequels, Aparajito (1956) and The World of Apu (1959)—the three together are known as “the Apu Trilogy,” after their main character—has just been re-released by Janus Films in a pristine 4K restoration, to be made available in a Criterion Blu-ray set later this year. (The original negatives of all three films were burned in a film-lab fire in London in 1993, making the restoration process especially difficult.) If this trilogy comes anywhere near your town—it opened earlier this month for a run at New York’s Film Forum, with plans to spread to more U.S. cities through the summer—I can’t exhort you any more strongly to see it than Kurosawa already has. Do you really want to exist in the world without ever seeing the sun or the moon? Those analogies from nature—celestial bodies, a flowing river—are especially apt for the first film, Pather Panchali (the title translates as “song of the little road”), which takes place in a forested region of Bengal remote enough that even a glimpse of a passing train is a daylong hike away. The Roy family—the impecunious Brahmin scholar and would-be writer Harihar (Kanu Banerjee), his more practical wife Sarbajaya (Karuna Banerjee), and their mischievous daughter Durga (Shampa “Runki” Banerjee as a child, Uma Das Gupta as a teenager)—once owned an orchard but were forced to sell it out of financial need. Now, to Sarbajaya’s lasting shame, they must listen to the neighbor family who bought the land from them accuse their daughter of theft.

Standing above fashion, it creates a world so convincing that it becomes, for a time, another life we might have lived.\" Roger Ebert wrote that about \"The Apu Trilogy\" when he inducted the films into his Great Movies pantheon in 2001, and we're reminded of this truth with the recent 4K restorations of Satyajit Ray's essential work. Few films are more beloved or more influential than \"Pather Panchali\", \"Aparajito\", and \"The World of Apu\", which have recently been lovingly, remarkably restored after a nitrate fire burned the originals over two decades ago. Now in theaters in New York City and soon making their way around the country, Ray's films have that remarkable ability to transcend time. They will always matter. They will always be important. They will always define what Roger spoke so eloquently about when he envisioned film as an empathy machine, a way to step into another person's life. Watching them again in 2015, Satyajit Ray's films simulataneously transport us to a world not directly like our own and do so with enough relatable human emotion that we see ourselves in it. It is not only another life we might have lived but a reflection of our own. It was 1992 when the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences chose to give Ray a Lifetime Achievement Oscar. The producers of the telecast were dismayed at the poor quality of the available prints for the montage and set out to restore Ray's films. The next year, they shipped original negatives, including those of \"The Apu Trilogy\" to London. Tragedy struck when a nitrate fire spread from a lab to the vaults, burning a few dozen films, including Ray's. What remained was sent to the Academy Film Archive, but the prognosis was dire. They were deemed unsalvageable at the time and it really looked like we might lose \"The Apu Trilogy\" forever. Well, technology improves. And, in 2013, the Criterion Collection began an exhaustive project with the Academy Film Archive, transporting the materials that remained to L'Immagine Ritrovata in Bologna. Working delicately with the damaged materials, technicians developed a special solution to rehydrate what they could, physically repairing the film over thousands of hours of careful work. Duplicate negatives from the Academy, the Harvard Film Archive, the British Film Institute, and Janus Films filled in any blanks left by frames that were burned to ash in '93. According to Janus, 40% of \"Pather Panchali\" and over 60% of \"Aparajito\" now consists of original negative. The incredible effort can be seen right there on the screen (at the Film Forum in NYC for the next few weeks before coming to other markets and, one presumes, Blu-ray later this year). The films reveal almost no visual degradation. Occassionally, the picture will jump as if a few frames are missing, but it's hard to believe that these aren't remasters from original material through and through. It's also impossible to watch \"The Apu Trilogy\" and not consider its place in film history. The Criterion Collection recently released Jean Renoir's \"The River,\" a film that has an undeniable influence on Ray in that he met Renoir when it was filming in India. He also met Subrata Mitra, a production assistant of Renoir's, who would go on to shoot \"The Apu Trilogy,\" conveying in Ray's films much of the cinematic river of life approach seen in Renoir's. And the list of films and filmmakers influenced by Ray's is too lengthy to even consider. Martin Scorsese once said about Ray, \"Without a doubt, in his films the line between poetry and cinema, dissolved.\" To say that Ray's cinematic poetry has \"held up\" would be a ridiculous understatement. Like Ozu's \"Tokyo Story\", there's a timeless quality to \"Pather Panchali\" that's mesmerizing. Without forced melodrama, Apu's family very quickly becomes ours. The primary forces that shape Apu's life are essential to humanity whether they be as primal as hunger or as coveted as the love of family. This is humanity. It will always matter. And Ray's ability to turn that human essence into art shouldn't be underrated. It's not just the themes of \"The Apu Trilogy\" but how they're conveyed. Just look at the choice of camera position in \"Pather\". Children like Apu and Durga are often shot from above, eyes upward at adults and the brave new world that fascinates them. Adults, especially those outside of the family, are shot from below, visually giving people like Sarbajaya the towering power of a matriarch. Durga, one of the most endearing characters in the Apu films, is a little thief who grows up to be a mindful, solemnly beautiful young lady. Even when she isn't present onscreen, her spirit lingers across the three films in this saga of poor but loving family. There are echoes of her behavior, impish, sweet and compassionate, everywhere in the trilogy. She is the best in us, our loving and adventurous nature. There isn't much new to say about a series that many consider like a loved one, except that they feel new each time—precisely the feeling of wonder and fluttering anticipation you feel when going to meet someone you adore. Apu, his sister Durga, his father Harihar and his mother Sarbajaya haven't aged a day, and the particulars of their story continue to yield astonishing surprises. For example: A friend observed that these films are really all about Apu's mother. There's much evidence to support her claim. So many shots linger upon Sarbajaya mentally weighing the fate of her family against the demands of survival, making decisions that no one else considers but which save them from disaster for another day, at least. Ray records these sacrifices in appropriately reverential way that, this time around, made me think of the first shot of Xavier Dolan's \"Mommy\", in which the camera hovers over the title character, a widower raising a volatile son, as she basks in sunlight—an adoring, sanctifying gesture on the filmmaker's part. This kind of courtly attention to poor, struggling characters can be devastatingly beautiful in a certain context. Here in America, the context is often one of shame and silence regarding the poor. Even in sympathy, the camera tends to glance condescendingly, offering up so little evidence of an individual. In \"Pather Panchali,\" we learn very little about Sarbajaya's past or her dreams, but we get ample time and space to consider them, to see her as we might see our own mother, or ourselves. European and American films helped Ray figure how to convey these moments in an exciting way, but he refined the approach, arguably applying more patience and restraint (particularly in the lighting) than his heroes, Ford, Renoir, De Sica. As a result, it's hard to accept that Karuna Banerjee as Sarbajaya was not among the non-professional cast members but, in fact, a seasoned actress; that we are not watching, in some sense, a documentary. The same goes for the rest of the family. Ray's manner of passing time with them lets them settle in our thoughts as something more than characters. What they do and what happens to them registers with more force yet with less noise than that of a typical drama of the time—in any country. When Harihar, a gentle and decent man of faith, appears out of a crowd of strangers in the beginning of \"Aparajito,\" my heart leaps every time. My friend is back! What's he been up to? How has life been treating him since we last passed the time together? Ray knows that anyone who has watched \"Pather Panchali\" will patiently await the answers, a return on the investment. Apu, of course, is with us for the duration. We attend his birth, his childhood, his coming of age and his unique but (emotionally) universal initiation into manhood. There is much silence and stillness along the way, but never a dull moment. The artfully mixed natural sounds and the music of Ravi Shankar are a river that Apu navigates. The boat is the camera that cinematographer Subrata Mita pilots. Dulal Dutta's editing sends it along the story's tributaries, channels and deltas with a flow modern filmmakers have simply forgotten. When we are left on the bank by the end of it and must let Apu sail on, there is no time for sadness. We walk away with a gift, a keepsake for a lifetime.

Since he started as film critic for the Chicago Sun-Times in 1967, and began covering movies locally and at international film festivals, Roger Ebert has met and interviewed countless movie idols, artists and unknowns -- some of them even before they became famous.

So many shots linger upon Sarbajaya mentally weighing the fate of her family against the demands of survival, making decisions that no one else considers but which save them from disaster for another day, at least. Ray records these sacrifices in appropriately reverential way that, this time around, made me think of the first shot of Xavier Dolan's \"Mommy\", in which the camera hovers over the title character, a widower raising a volatile son, as she basks in sunlight—an adoring, sanctifying gesture on the filmmaker's part.This kind of courtly attention to poor, struggling characters can be devastatingly beautiful in a certain context. Here in America, the context is often one of shame and silence regarding the poor. Even in sympathy, the camera tends to glance condescendingly, offering up so little evidence of an individual. In \"Pather Panchali,\" we learn very little about Sarbajaya's past or her dreams, but we get ample time and space to consider them, to see her as we might see our own mother, or ourselves. European and American films helped Ray figure how to convey these moments in an exciting way, but he refined the approach, arguably applying more patience and restraint (particularly in the lighting) than his heroes, Ford, Renoir, De Sica. As a result, it's hard to accept that Karuna Banerjee as Sarbajaya was not among the non-professional cast members but, in fact, a seasoned actress; that we are not watching, in some sense, a documentary. The same goes for the rest of the family. Ray's manner of passing time with them lets them settle in our thoughts as something more than characters. What they do and what happens to them registers with more force yet with less noise than that of a typical drama of the time—in any country.When Harihar, a gentle and decent man of faith, appears out of a crowd of strangers in the beginning of \"Aparajito,\" my heart leaps every time. My friend is back! What's he been up to? How has life been treating him since we last passed the time together? Ray knows that anyone who has watched \"Pather Panchali\" will patiently await the answers, a return on the investment.Apu, of course, is with us for the duration. We attend his birth, his childhood, his coming of age and his unique but (emotionally) universal initiation into manhood. There is much silence and stillness along the way, but never a dull moment. The artfully mixed natural sounds and the music of Ravi Shankar are a river that Apu navigates. The boat is the camera that cinematographer Subrata Mita pilots. Dulal Dutta's editing sends it along the story's tributaries, channels and deltas with a flow modern filmmakers have simply forgotten. When we are left on the bank by the end of it and must let Apu sail on, there is no time for sadness. We walk away with a gift, a keepsake for a lifetime.

Since he started as film critic for the Chicago Sun-Times in 1967, and began covering movies locally and at international film festivals, Roger Ebert has met and interviewed countless movie idols, artists and unknowns -- some of them even before they became famous. There's hardly a major figure in the history of movies, from the last part of the 20th century into the 21st, that he hasn't encountered. Roger Ebert has attended international film festivals and events for almost half a century, from the Kolkata International Film Festival to the Academy Awards. In addition to his coverage, our contributors report the latest from Cannes, Telluride, Toronto, Sundance and other movie showcases world-wide. \"Life Itself,\" based on Roger Ebert's memoir and directed by Steve James, will open in theaters and be available On Demand on July 4, 2014. The Cannes International Film Festival is the most talked-about film festival of the year, where directors from around the world showcase their newest work, from the most challenging art cinema to the big blockbusters. For many years, Roger Ebert and a team of contributors have covered Cannes, and we are continuing that tradition with start-to-finish coverage from around the festival. A collection of tributes to Roger from various sources. The opening shot of a movie can tell us a lot about how to view and interpret what follows. It can even represent the whole movie in miniature.

Scott 2022 The New York Times Company", " Sunday, December 8, 2013 Alternate title: The Apu Trilogy, The Song of the Little Road, The Masterworks of Satyajit Ray Pather Panchali (Father Panchali), Indian director Satyajit Ray's first feature film, relates the story of an impoverished Bengalese family. When the father (Karuna Bannerjee) leaves for the city to pursue a writing career, the mother (Karuna Banerji) is left with the responsibility of caring for the rest of the brood. Gradually, the film's true central character emerges: Apu (Subir Banerji), the family's son. Though excruciatingly realistic at times, Pather Panchali takes an occasional timeout to dwell on the purely cinematic. For example, when the mother receives a postcard bearing good news, RAY dissolves to a pond, where a pair of water skates scamper about. The music by Ravi Shankar at first seems to be at odds with the action; soon, however, we come to accept the music as a logical outgrowth of the events at hand. A multiple award winner, Pather Panchali was the first of RAY's celebrated \"Apu Trilogy\" (the other two entries were 1956's Aparajito and 1959's The World of Apu). The film was also released as The Song of the Road and The Lament of the Path. ~ Hal Erickson, Rovi Full New York Times Review » Go to Cast & Credits » © 2010 Baseline, All rights reserved. © 2010 All Media Guide, LLC Portions of content provided by All Movie Guide ®, a trademark of All Media Guide, LLC Also in Arts » U.S. Global Movies or Showtimes by ZIP Code Pather Panchali 1955 NYT Critics' Pick | Satyajit Ray NYT Critics' Pick Best 1,000 Adaptation, Drama", "", " British Board of Film Classification Main navigation: Secondary navigation: Search what you want to watch Advanced search Type Feature Approx.

Kolkata - 10 Apr 2018 12:30 IST Updated : 12 Apr 2018 12:41 IST Roushni Sarkar One cannot help but refer to filmmaker Shakti Samanta’s immortal creations when it comes to the romantic classics of the golden era of Hindi cinema. According to Bengali critic Kantiranjan De, the creator of Kashmir Ki Kali (1964), An Evening in Paris (1967), Aradhana (1969), Kati Patang (1970), Amar Prem (1972); thoughtfully catered to all the nuances that are required for successful commercial films, but always made sure he stayed connected to his roots in Bengal. The student of Calcutta University and an aspiring hero, Samanta decided to shift his goal to direction as he started working with Bengali film director Phani Majumdar, who was then considered to be an institution himself, in Bombay. As De would point out, Samanta received his first break with Howrah Bridge (1958), a film with a title that refers to the historical architecture from Bengal and major parts of the film were shot in various locations around Calcutta. With various Hindi commercial hits to his credits, Samanta decided to make films in both Hindi and Bengali in the later phase of his career. National award winning filmmaker Prabhat Roy, director of Shwet Patharer Thala (1992), Lathi (1996) and many other successful commercial Bengali films, joined Shakti Films as an assistant since the making of Charitraheen (1974). He gradually came to play a more important role as Samanta went on to make films in double versions and Roy got assigned with the task of writing the Bengali scripts of Aradhana (1969), Amanush (1975) and Anand Ashram (1977). Roy, who considers working as an assistant director for Samanta’s Anusandhan (1981) to be a turning point in his career, speaks of the motivations and inspirations that prompted the director to work for the Bengali film industry with his ingenious style and also shares fond memories with his mentor. Apart from the ones mentioned above, Samanta also made Anyay Abichar (1985), Andha Bichar (1990) and Devdas (2002) in Bengali. On Samanta's 9th death anniversary (he passed away on 9 April 2009), we spoke to Roy about his mentor's style of working, Bengali roots and fond memories. Excerpts from the interview: Shakti Samanta had already established himself as one of the most successful commercial directors in Hindi cinema. Why did he suddenly decide to make films in the language of his roots? I had started to work with Shakti da since 1973. During that time he suddenly felt the need to dub one of his most successful films Aradhana (1969) in Bengali. There was no prohibition on dubbing big budget Hindi films in Bengali then, unlike the present time. Knowing my aptitude, he asked me to write down the dialogues in Bengali and hence, Aradhana, in which the majority of the artistes were Bengali — Sharmila Tagore, Ashok Kumar and Anita Guha — was released with a Bengali version. The successful initiative pushed Shakti da towards making more films in Bengali. He conceived the idea of Amanush based on acclaimed Bengali writer Shaktipada Rajguru’s story and again I was involved in the script writing. The powerful cast of Uttam Kumar, Sharmila Tagore, Utpal Dutt and Anil Chatterjee delivered a box-office hit. Thus, a new chapter unfolded in Shakti da’s career and he eventually made Anand Ashram again with Uttam Kumar, Sharmila Tagore along with Ashok Kumar and Anusandhan with Amitabh Bachchan, Rakhee Gulzar, Utpal Dutt and Amjad Khan in Bengali. According to Shakti da’s wish, all the actors in Anusandhan (1981) dubbed the dialogues in Bengali in their own voices and I would help them with learning the language. The Hindi version of Anusandhan was later released as Barsaat Ki Ek Raat. Is it true that despite staying focused on establishing himself in the Bombay film industry, Shakti Samanta always wanted to represent his connections with Bengal through a bigger platform? He was always fascinated with Bengali literature and therefore, he made a lot of films on Bengali stories. For example, Anurodh (1997) and Ayaash (1982) were the Hindi adaptations of novels Deya Neya and Stri by Saratchandra Chattopadhyay; and Amar Prem (1971) was based on another celebrated Bengali author Bibhutibhushan Bandopadhyay’s novel, Nishipadma. Shakti da would always tell us that the audience should be able to relate to the storyline of a film and feel a part of it. To him, Bengali stories had the ability to strike the chords in the audience’s hearts. Also most of his crew consisted of Bengali talent.... Exactly so! His brother Girija Samanta was both the production manager and producer of Shakti Films. Apart from me, Ranjan Bose, Sachin Bhowmick and Shailajananda Mukherjee were heavily relied upon by Shakti da for scripts. Art director Shanti Das and cinematographer Alok Dasgupta were Shakti da’s consistent team members throughout his career. He had an intimate friendship with the Bengali father-son duo of music directors Sachin Dev Burman and Rahul Dev Barman who lent distinctive dimensions in Shakti da’s films, making them more appealing to the audience with content specific music and haunting melodies. Also, he would often look forward to casting Bengali actors in supporting roles. Is it true that Shakti Samanta decided to make Amanush after the box office failure of Chhoti Si Mulaqat (1967) in order to assure the position and fame of Uttam Kumar [he produced Chhoti Si Mulaqat] in the Bombay film industry? Shakti da had immense respect for Uttam Kumar and he had always wanted to make a film with him. It is true that after the failure of Chhoti Si Mulaqat, he got the right opportunity to turn his dream into reality. Uttam Kumar would almost be devastated after the loss; however, Shakti da chose to stand by him and with Amanush Uttam Kumar’s true worth was ensured in the Bombay film industry. He also introduced many other Bengali actors came to the Bombay film industry and made them famous... Yes. He definitely introduced Sharmila Tagore and Moushumi Chatterjee to the Bombay film industry. Though Sharmila Tagore had already worked with the legendary film director Satyajit Ray, she would admit it publicly that she got the training to act in commercial films from Shakti da. Sharmila Tagore’s debut appearance in Samanta’s Kashmir Ki Kali (1964) and the success of An Evening in Paris (1967), Amar Prem (1972), Aradhana (1969), Amanush (1975), Anand Ashram (1977) turned her into one of the leading actresses of the 1970s and 1980s. Can you share a few fond memories with your mentor? There are many interesting stories on my association with Shakti da but I would like to share two of them that essentially reflect the strong points of his characteristics as a filmmaker. Shakti da was very brave in his decisions and never wanted to compromise. During the shooting of Amanush (1975), despite being repeatedly warned of the danger in the Sunderbans, he built an entire resort there for the cast and crew. Another story refers to the time when he was admitted in the Lilavati Hospital [in Mumbai] after he suffered a heart attack. When I had gone to visit him, he would point out to me the number of pipes linked to the instruments in the cabin and would ask me to closely observe those so that I can remember and later apply the knowledge in my work. This impeccable power of observation made Shakti da achieve the success in crafting his characters, as well as ensure the realistic depiction of the stories in his films. Whatever I have achieved today is because of all the lessons I learnt from Shakti Da. Without his close association I do not think that I could have earned my name in film direction.

On Samanta's 9th death anniversary (he passed away on 9 April 2009), we spoke to Roy about his mentor's style of working, Bengali roots and fond memories. Prabhat Roy Excerpts from the interview: Shakti Samanta had already established himself as one of the most successful commercial directors in Hindi cinema. Why did he suddenly decide to make films in the language of his roots? I had started to work with Shakti da since 1973. During that time he suddenly felt the need to dub one of his most successful films Aradhana (1969) in Bengali. There was no prohibition on dubbing big budget Hindi films in Bengali then, unlike the present time. Knowing my aptitude, he asked me to write down the dialogues in Bengali and hence, Aradhana, in which the majority of the artistes were Bengali — Sharmila Tagore, Ashok Kumar and Anita Guha — was released with a Bengali version. The successful initiative pushed Shakti da towards making more films in Bengali. He conceived the idea of Amanush based on acclaimed Bengali writer Shaktipada Rajguru’s story and again I was involved in the script writing. The powerful cast of Uttam Kumar, Sharmila Tagore, Utpal Dutt and Anil Chatterjee delivered a box-office hit. Thus, a new chapter unfolded in Shakti da’s career and he eventually made Anand Ashram again with Uttam Kumar, Sharmila Tagore along with Ashok Kumar and Anusandhan with Amitabh Bachchan, Rakhee Gulzar, Utpal Dutt and Amjad Khan in Bengali. According to Shakti da’s wish, all the actors in Anusandhan (1981) dubbed the dialogues in Bengali in their own voices and I would help them with learning the language. The Hindi version of Anusandhan was later released as Barsaat Ki Ek Raat. Is it true that despite staying focused on establishing himself in the Bombay film industry, Shakti Samanta always wanted to represent his connections with Bengal through a bigger platform? He was always fascinated with Bengali literature and therefore, he made a lot of films on Bengali stories. For example, Anurodh (1997) and Ayaash (1982) were the Hindi adaptations of novels Deya Neya and Stri by Saratchandra Chattopadhyay; and Amar Prem (1971) was based on another celebrated Bengali author Bibhutibhushan Bandopadhyay’s novel, Nishipadma. Shakti da would always tell us that the audience should be able to relate to the storyline of a film and feel a part of it. To him, Bengali stories had the ability to strike the chords in the audience’s hearts. Also most of his crew consisted of Bengali talent.... Exactly so! His brother Girija Samanta was both the production manager and producer of Shakti Films. Apart from me, Ranjan Bose, Sachin Bhowmick and Shailajananda Mukherjee were heavily relied upon by Shakti da for scripts. Art director Shanti Das and cinematographer Alok Dasgupta were Shakti da’s consistent team members throughout his career. He had an intimate friendship with the Bengali father-son duo of music directors Sachin Dev Burman and Rahul Dev Barman who lent distinctive dimensions in Shakti da’s films, making them more appealing to the audience with content specific music and haunting melodies. Also, he would often look forward to casting Bengali actors in supporting roles. Is it true that Shakti Samanta decided to make Amanush after the box office failure of Chhoti Si Mulaqat (1967) in order to assure the position and fame of Uttam Kumar [he produced Chhoti Si Mulaqat] in the Bombay film industry? Shakti da had immense respect for Uttam Kumar and he had always wanted to make a film with him. It is true that after the failure of Chhoti Si Mulaqat, he got the right opportunity to turn his dream into reality. Uttam Kumar would almost be devastated after the loss; however, Shakti da chose to stand by him and with Amanush Uttam Kumar’s true worth was ensured in the Bombay film industry. He also introduced many other Bengali actors came to the Bombay film industry and made them famous... Yes. He definitely introduced Sharmila Tagore and Moushumi Chatterjee to the Bombay film industry. Though Sharmila Tagore had already worked with the legendary film director Satyajit Ray, she would admit it publicly that she got the training to act in commercial films from Shakti da. Sharmila Tagore’s debut appearance in Samanta’s Kashmir Ki Kali (1964) and the success of An Evening in Paris (1967), Amar Prem (1972), Aradhana (1969), Amanush (1975), Anand Ashram (1977) turned her into one of the leading actresses of the 1970s and 1980s. Can you share a few fond memories with your mentor? There are many interesting stories on my association with Shakti da but I would like to share two of them that essentially reflect the strong points of his characteristics as a filmmaker. Shakti da was very brave in his decisions and never wanted to compromise. During the shooting of Amanush (1975), despite being repeatedly warned of the danger in the Sunderbans, he built an entire resort there for the cast and crew. Another story refers to the time when he was admitted in the Lilavati Hospital [in Mumbai] after he suffered a heart attack. When I had gone to visit him, he would point out to me the number of pipes linked to the instruments in the cabin and would ask me to closely observe those so that I can remember and later apply the knowledge in my work. This impeccable power of observation made Shakti da achieve the success in crafting his characters, as well as ensure the realistic depiction of the stories in his films. Whatever I have achieved today is because of all the lessons I learnt from Shakti Da. Without his close association I do not think that I could have earned my name in film direction.

It is often said there are only two things that unify the vast hordes of our diverse country, with its rainbow of religions, cultures, languages: cricket, and the Hindi film industry. However, the premise falls flat when considered against the backdrop of some of Bollywood’s abiding afflictions. Among these is the abject failure of male actors from regional cinema to break into the territory monopolised by the Kapoors, Khannas, Deols, Roshans and Bachchans. Although fine actors, even super-stars from regional cinema — the iconic Kamal Hasan, Mohanlal and Mammooty — have sparkled as shooting stars on the Hindi film screen, none of them managing to establish a firm foothold, as a frontrunner. Rajni sir, needless to say. is in a league of his own. Uttam Kumar, numero uno of the deeply entrenched Bengali cinema, is a case in point, as he managed to get roles in only a few Hindi films before his untimely death at the age of 53 in 1980. One only needs to watch Shakti Samantha’s “Amanush” (made simultaneously in Bengali and Hindi) to marvel at the scope of the man’s histrionic capabilities. Kumar shines as Madhusudan Roy Chaudhary, or Madhu, a straightforward scion of a zamindar family settled in a fishing village in the Sunderbans. He reflects angst and anger with understated ease after his life is ripped asunder by the machinations of the family munim , Maheem Ghosal (a superlative performance by veteran Utpal Dutt). Reduced to a penniless drunkard, he is condemned to live the life of an amanush — half human, and half beast. As a debauched vagabond, he raises his voice on behalf of the downtrodden who suffer under the highhanded and corrupt Ghosal. This brings him face to face with the law enforcers, who are often hand in glove with the wily Ghosal. It is in this backdrop that Inspector Bhuvan (Anil Chatterjee) lands in the village, where Ghosal ‘fills his ears’ against Madhu. Bhuvan, without going into merits of the case, acts harshly on Madhu, even whipping him at the police station. However, soon he comes to know the story of Madhu and his estranged love interest, Rekha (Sharmila Tagore). In a flashback, Madhu tells him how he was entrapped in a fake case of theft in his own house, whereon his ailing paternal uncle, under the influence of the munim , handed him over to the police. He is also accused of fathering a child through a prostitute. Before he can prove his innocence the woman is abducted and killed at the behest of Ghosal. On completing his prison sentence, Madhu returns to his village, only to find that his uncle has been murdered by the munim, who shows it as a case of natural death. Thereon, Bhuvan embarks on a mission to reform Madhu and gets him a contract for building a dam in an adjoining village. A determined Madhu, with his two sidekicks, completes the job commendably. He even wins back the confidence of Rekha, whom he saves from drunken streamer operators one night. But the ice is finally broken when the village is endangered by raging flood waters that threaten to breach the dam. All villagers persuade Madhu to take the mantle of saving the village, but he spurns them, blaming them for his misery. Finally, on a visit by Rekha he relents, and saves the dam and the village from havoc. His honour is restored, as is his love interest. Ghosal is arrested for his wrongdoings by Bhuvan, even as he is transferred to a new posting. Shakti Samantha wields the baton with a clear vision. He manages to draw superlative performances from Uttam Kumar and Utpal Dutt. Dutt merges himself into the character like a chameleon. His facial expressions and voice modulation are excellent. It is unfortunate that such an actor was confined to a straitjacket in subsequent years. His role as Ghosal is a benchmark. Sharmila Tagore is commendable as Rekha, although, at times, she looks too polished for what is essentially a village belle running a kindergarten school in a remote village. Other actors like Abhi Bhattacharya (as Dr. Anand, Rekha’s elder brother), Asit Sen as the village priest and Anil Chatterjee are creditable. Prema Narayan as Dhanno, in the major role of a large-hearted prostitute in love with Madhu — that could have given a fillip to her career — is average. She imparts oomph, but is expressionless, like a wall. The film, shot on location by Aloke Dasgupta, infuses life in a small fishing village. The editing by Bijoy Chowdary is slick, and art direction by Shanti Dass excellent. Equally riveting are the dialogues, credited to Kamleshwar, which bring to life the milieu around which the story is woven. Samantha shows his prowess over music, as each of the six numbers set to music by Shymal Mitra and lyrics by Indeevar is a rare gem. The best of the lot is undoubtedly the Kishore Kumar song “Dil Aisa Kisi Ne Mera Toda”, which won him the Filmfare Best Male Playback Award. Indeevar bagged the best lyricist trophy for the same song.

Go to Google Play Now » This book examines the development of television in India since the early 1990s, and its implications for Indian society more widely. Until 1991, India possessed only a single state-owned television channel, but since then there has been a rapid expansion in independent satellite channels which came as a complete break from the statist control of the past. This book explores this transformation, explaining how television, a medium that developed in the industrial West, was adapted to suit Indian conditions, and in turn has altered Indian social practices, making possible new ways of imagining identities, conducting politics and engaging with the state. In particular, satellite television initially came to India as the representative of global capitalism but it was appropriated by Indian entrepreneurs and producers who Indianized it. Considering the full gamut of Indian television - from \"national\" networks in English and Hindi to the state of regional language networks – this book elucidates the transformative impact of television on a range of important social practices, including politics and democracy, sport and identity formation, cinema and popular culture. Overall, it shows how the story of television in India is also the story of India's encounter with the forces of globalisation.

ডেসমন্ড এবার মেয়েটার পিছনে সময় দিতে লাগলো। ওকে গল্প শোনায়- যীশুর গল্প। পাতার বাঁশি বানিয়ে দেয়, বাজিয়ে শোনায়। আরেকদিন গ্রামে খবর এলো, হাটে পাকবাহিনী এসেছে। তারা হাট জ্বালিয়ে দিয়েছে। গ্রামের পর গ্রাম জ্বালিয়ে দিচ্ছে। যাকে পাচ্ছে তাকেই গুলি করে মারছে। আরেক গ্রামের গির্জার ফাদারকে বেয়নেট দিয়ে খুঁচিয়ে মেরেছে। শিশু-বৃদ্ধ, জোয়ান-বুড়ো, ফাদার-জেলে, কাউকে ওরা ছাড়ছে না, সবাইকে মারছে। গ্রামের সব লোক ভয়ে পালাতে লাগলো। গির্জা ছেড়ে পালিয়ে গেলেন স্বয়ং ফাদারও। কেবল থেকে গেলেন বুড়ো ডেসমন্ড আর ঐ ফুটফুটে মেয়েটা। ওদিকে এই জেলেপাড়াতেও পাকবাহিনী এসে পড়লো। ডেসমন্ড মেয়েটাকে বললেন ঘর থেকে না বের হতে। আর নিজে দেখতে গেলেন বাইরের অবস্থা। ওদিকে পাকবাহিনী এসে সবাইকে বাড়ি থেকে বের করে করে মারতে লাগলো। ডেসমন্ড গ্রামে ফিরে দেখেন, পুরো গ্রাম জ্বালিয়ে আর কিছু বাদ রাখেনি পাকবাহিনী। যতো বাড়ি ছিল, সব জ্বালিয়ে দিয়ে গেছে। যতো মানুষ ছিল সবাইকে মেরে রেখে গেছে। কেউ বেঁচে নেই। মেয়েদেরও ওরা মেরে ফেলেছে। আর সেসব লাশেরই মাঝে পড়ে রয়েছে সেই ফুটফুটে বোবা মেয়েটার লাশ। ডেসমন্ড মেয়েটাকে জড়িয়ে ধরে ডুকরে কেঁদে উঠলেন। ওকে কবর দিয়ে ছোট্ট ক্রুশ পুঁতে দিলেন ওর মাথার কাছে। এবার পৃথিবীতে একেবারেই একা হয়ে গেলেন ডেসমন্ড। ওদিকে মাস্টার তো অনেক আগেই যুদ্ধে চলে গেছেন। তাঁর বাহিনীর কয়েকটা ছোটো দলের থাকার জায়গা দরকার। মাস্টার ওদের একটা দলকে পাঠিয়ে দিলেন ডেসমন্ড কাকার কাছে। আর ডেসমন্ড কাকাও অনেক আগেই বুঝে গেছেন, এ যুদ্ধ সবারই যুদ্ধ। এ যুদ্ধ কোনো রাজনৈতিক যুদ্ধ নয়, এ যুদ্ধ তাঁর জীবনের যুদ্ধ। সবাইকেই এখন কিছু না কিছু করতে হবে। ডেসমন্ডও ওদেরকে আশ্রয় দিলেন। তিনি তখনো সেই গির্জার পাশে তার ছোট্ট ঘরে থাকেন। সেখানে ওদেরকেও থাকতে দিলেন। ওদের খাওয়ালেন, ওদের যত্ন নিলেন। আর ওরা এখান থেকে যুদ্ধের প্রস্তুতি নিতে লাগলো। কিছুদিন পরে একটা ছোটোখাটো অপারেশনে বের হলো ওরা। একটা পাকিস্তানি ক্যাম্পে আক্রমণ করতে হবে। খুব একটা বড়ো নয় ক্যাম্পটা। ওদের দলটাই যথেষ্ট অপারেশনটা করতে। ডেসমন্ড কাকার কাছ থেকে দোয়া নিয়ে ওরা বের হয়ে গেলো। আর তারপর প্রচন্ড যুদ্ধ করে হারিয়ে দিলো ক্যাম্পে থাকা পাক আর্মিদের। ওদের সবাইকেই যুদ্ধে মেরে ফেললো ওরা। এবার করা হবে একটা বড়ো অপারেশন। আশেপাশে পাকিস্তানিদের সবচেয়ে বড়ো ক্যাম্প কমলগঞ্জে। ওরা এই ক্যাম্পটাই আক্রমণ করবে। পিছন দিক আর একপাশ থেকে আক্রমণ করবে দুইটা-দুইটা চারটা দল। আরেকপাশে থাকবে ওদের দলসহ তিনটা দল। আর সামনে থেকে আক্রমণে নেতৃত্ব দেবে মাস্টারের দলসহ তিনটা দল। মোট ১০টা দল মিলে সাঁড়াশি আক্রমণ করে ওরা দখল করে নেবে কমলগঞ্জের পাকিস্তানি ক্যাম্প। সব প্রস্তুতি নিয়ে ডেসমন্ড কাকার কাছ থেকে দোয়া নিয়ে ওরা বেরিয়ে পড়লো। কমলগঞ্জ ক্যাম্পে শুরু হলো যুদ্ধ। সে এক ভীষণ যুদ্ধ! ওখানে পাকিস্তানি বাহিনীর ডেরাও ভীষণ মজবুত, কোনোভাবেই দখল করা যাচ্ছে না।কাহিনি সংক্ষেপ: 'একাত্তরের যীশু' (চলচ্চিত্র) তথ্য সংগ্রহ, ৫ই ফেব্রুয়ারি ২০১১ যুদ্ধে জয় হয় মুক্তিযোদ্ধাদের। তারপর সেখান থেকেই ক'জন মুক্তিযোদ্ধা খুশি হয়ে জয় নিয়ে ফিরছিল। পথিমধ্যে অন্ধকার জঙ্গুলে পথে পাকবাহিনীর অ্যাম্বুশে পড়ে তারা। কোনো রকমে পালিয়ে গিয়ে আশ্রয় নেয় গির্জায়। সেখানে মারা যায় কেউ কেউ। যারা বেঁচে যায়, গুলি খরচ করে শেষ করে ফেলে, কিন্তু পাকবাহিনীর সদস্যদের মারতে পারে না। অবশেষে তারা পাক আর্মির কাছে ধরা পড়ে। গির্জার কেয়ারটেকার ডেসমন্ডকে সামনে পেয়ে মুক্তিযোদ্ধাদের পরিচয় জানতে চায় তারা। কিন্তু ডেসমন্ড নিজের প্রাণ বাঁচাতে অস্বীকার করে মুক্তিযোদ্ধাদের পরিচিতি, অথচ এদেরকেই লালন করেছেন তিনি এই ক'দিন। পাক আর্মি, গির্জার সামনে রাখা যীশুর ক্রুশবিদ্ধ মূর্তি দেখে অনুরূপভাবে ক্রুশবিদ্ধ করে এই তিন মুক্তিযোদ্ধাদের, মাঠের মধ্যে টানিয়ে দেয়। প্রচণ্ড বিষাদ নিয়ে কাঁদতে থাকেন ডেসমন্ড। তাঁর কি করার কিছুই ছিল না?", "references": [""]}, {"title": "Introduction", "content": "একাত্তরের যীশু ১৯৯৩ সালে মুক্তিপ্রাপ্ত বাংলাদেশের স্বাধীনতা যুদ্ধ ভিত্তিক একটি বাংলাদেশী চলচ্চিত্র।'একাত্তরের যীশু' (চলচ্চিত্র) তথ্য সংগ্রহ: ৫ ফেব্রুয়ারি ২০১১ লেখক শাহরিয়ার কবির-এর লেখা একাত্তরের যীশু (উপন্যাস)'একাত্তরের যীশু' (উপন্যাস) তথ্যসুত্রঃ দৈনিক কালের কণ্ঠ, ১১ ডিসেম্বর ২০১০, তথ্য সংগ্রহঃ ৫ই ফেব্রুয়ারি ২০১১ অবলম্বনে ছবিটি পরিচালনা করেছেন নাসির উদ্দিন ইউসুফ। ছবির প্রধান প্রধান চরিত্রগুলোতে অভিনয় করেছেন পীযূষ বন্দ্যোপাধ্যায়, হুমায়ুন ফরীদি, জহির উদ্দিন পিয়াল, আবুল খায়ের, আনওয়ার ফারুক, কামাল বায়েজীদ ও শহীদুজ্জামান সেলিম। এছাড়াও বিভিন্ন চরিত্রে অভিনয় করেছেন ইব্রাহিম বিদ্যুৎ, শতদল বড়ুয়া বিলু, সাইফুদ্দিন আহমেদ দুলাল, ফারুক আহমেদ, ইউসুফ খসরু, দেলোয়ার হোসেনসহ আরও অনেকে।", "references": ["", ""]}]}

Agni Pareeksha (1954) was the second film to feature Uttam Kumar and Suchitra Sen in the lead, but it became the first to trigger the tremendous box-office appeal of the pair that endured for two decades. Agni Pareeksha was based on a novel by Jnanpith award-winning littérateur Ashapurna Devi, whose own life story reads like an incredible novel. Ashapurna Devi was a brilliant fiction writer who had never set foot inside a school. She is known for her strong female characters. Some critics played down the importance of her work, calling her a \"kitchen writer\". But she proved them wrong by writing prolifically and courageously while managing a home with a husband and three children. Agni Pareeksha celebrated the sanctity of marriage though the protagonists are married off as children, when they do not even know the meaning of the term. In this sense, Agni Pareeksha, in retrospect, appears to encourage child marriage, in sharp contrast to Ashapurna Devi’s bold and often radical literary oeuvre. The film is filled with moments of melodrama from beginning to end. But the melodrama defines the film’s character and the interaction between and among the main people involved in the story. Tapasi is married off as a girl to teenage zamindar boy Bulu on the insistence of her grandmother and against the wishes of her mother, who learns of it after the wedding has taken place. The mother is fleshed out in negative shades because she is against early marriage and wishes to bring Tapasi up through education and in Westernized ways. Her angry mother brings Tapasi back from the zamindar's ancestral home and her father dies of shock. Destiny catches up when she meets a handsome, educated and Westernized young man, Kiriti, during a visit to a hill station. Though the two fall in love, Tapasi is constantly disturbed by faint and random memories of her marriage. Since she has no knowledge about her childhood groom’s present life, she is torn among thoughts of whether she is a married woman, an unmarried woman or a widow. Tapasi realizes that the emotional bond between herself and Kiriti is getting stronger by the day, and it appears that she has forgotten about her marriage as a child many years ago. Then one day her car stops to let a marriage procession pass. The bride is a little girl. When Tapasi sees the scene her childhood memories come rushing back, and she is traumatized. One does not get to see the bride closely, but the damage is done. Tapasi is almost seized by a strange fear and by feelings of deep guilt. From then on, she stops going out, stops meeting Kiriti, stops dressing up, leaves her hair loose and refuses even to step out of her room. Kiriti comes every day, but Tapasi does not wish to meet him. The change in Tapasi’s life affects the rest of the family. One can glimpse sparks of good acting by Suchitra Sen as Tapasi, though in keeping with the style of the period, there is an element of overacting and exaggeration. As Kiriti, Uttam Kumar’s performance is balanced and credible. Suchitra Sen limited herself because she was conscious of how the camera would capture her face from different angles and with different degrees of light and shadow. It was a time when the beautiful face of the heroine was more important than her acting talent for the director, the cameraman and the actress herself. From the moment she meets Kiriti for the first time at the hill station till the last minute when the two meet in the ancestral village home, Tapasi looks beautiful. Her good-for-nothing brothers are quick to point out that she holds a master's degree in English with a first class, can speak English like an Englishwoman, and can sing like a nightingale. This suits the purpose of the projected love story because Kiriti with his smashing looks, polished manner, high education and the elitist ‘stamp’ of a 10-year stay across the UK, Europe and the USA is considered the perfect match for Tapasi. Kiriti is the same Bulu now an adult, handsome, successful and eligible. Bulu chooses to become an impersonation of himself through Kiriti keeping his identity hidden from Tapasi and her family. This impersonation is triggered by his desire to see Tapasi go through an agni pareeksha — a trial by fire — holding back the truth to be revealed only if and when Tapasi emerges from the ordeal successfully. This ‘doubling’ as someone else, which amounts to misleading the lady he has fallen in love with, is not only marred by strong patriarchal notions but is also a betrayal of the trust Tapasi has placed in him because she does not know this is the same Bulu she was married to. In 1954, when the film was released, divorce was a sacrilegious term in Hindu marriages negotiated by the respective families and believed to be for an eternity or till ‘death do us part.’ No one calls Kiriti’s wilful impersonation a breach of faith because that is how patriarchal values dominated society and this was reflected in cinema. “Through her misrecognition, the narrative dramatizes the confrontation between tradition and modernity as the conflict between the ‘double’ Bulu and Kiriti. Although much of the film unfolds from her point of view, ultimately she remains a pawn in the hands of the primary male subject. Since the audience realizes the truth before the protagonist does, the transgressive potential of her desire for 'another' man is contained; it is her masochistic struggles that become the primary locus of spectatorial pleasure.” (Sarkar, Bhaskar. Mourning the Nation: Indian Cinema in the Wake of Partition, Duke University Press, Orient Blackswan Pvt. Ltd, 2010, p152, chapter 3) In hindsight, Agni Pareeksha threw up the complete screen compatibility of Uttam Kumar and Suchitra Sen, also unwittingly pointing out the differences between the stars in terms of their screen image and command of the craft of acting. Suchitra Sen as the grown-up Tapasi enters the frame after a good 20-odd minutes of the film's runtime. The entire story is from Tapasi’s point of view. Yet, once Kiriti steps in, she becomes the object of the cinematic gaze and the story being manipulated, first, by her mother, brother, aunts and cousins, then by her own traumatic past, and, finally, by Bulu pretending to be someone else. Uttam Kumar as Kiriti takes over smoothly once he enters Tapasi's life. He is suave, charming, attractive and mesmerizing, and in complete command of the drama he has created. Suchitra Sen as Tapasi is like a beautiful counterfoil, in suffering and in pain when her life changes with dark memories superimposed into her present. The child Tapasi, portrayed by Shikha Rani Bag, is a classic performance that reaches beyond the adult Tapasi. The expression of complete puzzlement and confusion on her face as her eyes wander from the bed of the dying zamindar to the chandelier hanging above to her bridegroom, not understanding what is going on, is very convincing. Agni Pareeksha became a super-duper hit at the time because it did not contravene audience expectation of conventional middle-class morality. Tapasi ultimately goes back to the man she was married to as a girl. There is no ideological conflict in this which might have steered the audience the other way. The music and the placing and orchestration of the love songs — 'Ke Tumi Aamare Dako', 'Gaane Mor Kon Indradhanu' and 'Jodi Bhool Korey Bhool Modhur Holo' give an added dimension to the screen romance between Tapasi and Kiriti both before and after Tapasi is disturbed by the trauma of her childhood marriage. The film set the pace for the electric chemistry between the lead pair played by Uttam Kumar and Suchitra Sen and remains a milestone in Bengali cinema. Postscriipt: When Uttam Kumar produced the same Agni Pareeksha as Chhotisi Mulaqat in Hindi in 1967 with Vyjayanthimala playing the role Suchitra Sen had essayed in the original, the film was a miserable flop. Uttam Kumar's fans blamed a conspiracy by some of the big producers in Bombay cinema at the time. But the basic reason was that the topic had become passé. The tale of a girl and a boy who get married as children and meet again when they grow up no longer held the audience captive. Besides, Uttam Kumar had gone past his handsome prime. He had simply chosen the wrong time to try his luck in the Hindi film industry. Uttam Kumar suffered huge losses and had a heart attack. He never tried his luck as a producer in Bombay again.

Agni Pareeksha (1954) was the second film to feature Uttam Kumar and Suchitra Sen in the lead, but it became the first to trigger the tremendous box-office appeal of the pair that endured for two decades. Agni Pareeksha was based on a novel by Jnanpith award-winning littérateur Ashapurna Devi, whose own life story reads like an incredible novel. Ashapurna Devi was a brilliant fiction writer who had never set foot inside a school. She is known for her strong female characters. Some critics played down the importance of her work, calling her a \"kitchen writer\". But she proved them wrong by writing prolifically and courageously while managing a home with a husband and three children. Agni Pareeksha celebrated the sanctity of marriage though the protagonists are married off as children, when they do not even know the meaning of the term. In this sense, Agni Pareeksha, in retrospect, appears to encourage child marriage, in sharp contrast to Ashapurna Devi’s bold and often radical literary oeuvre. The film is filled with moments of melodrama from beginning to end. But the melodrama defines the film’s character and the interaction between and among the main people involved in the story. Tapasi is married off as a girl to teenage zamindar boy Bulu on the insistence of her grandmother and against the wishes of her mother, who learns of it after the wedding has taken place. The mother is fleshed out in negative shades because she is against early marriage and wishes to bring Tapasi up through education and in Westernized ways. Her angry mother brings Tapasi back from the zamindar's ancestral home and her father dies of shock. Destiny catches up when she meets a handsome, educated and Westernized young man, Kiriti, during a visit to a hill station. Though the two fall in love, Tapasi is constantly disturbed by faint and random memories of her marriage. Since she has no knowledge about her childhood groom’s present life, she is torn among thoughts of whether she is a married woman, an unmarried woman or a widow. Tapasi realizes that the emotional bond between herself and Kiriti is getting stronger by the day, and it appears that she has forgotten about her marriage as a child many years ago. Then one day her car stops to let a marriage procession pass. The bride is a little girl. When Tapasi sees the scene her childhood memories come rushing back, and she is traumatized. One does not get to see the bride closely, but the damage is done. Tapasi is almost seized by a strange fear and by feelings of deep guilt. From then on, she stops going out, stops meeting Kiriti, stops dressing up, leaves her hair loose and refuses even to step out of her room. Kiriti comes every day, but Tapasi does not wish to meet him. The change in Tapasi’s life affects the rest of the family. One can glimpse sparks of good acting by Suchitra Sen as Tapasi, though in keeping with the style of the period, there is an element of overacting and exaggeration. As Kiriti, Uttam Kumar’s performance is balanced and credible. Suchitra Sen limited herself because she was conscious of how the camera would capture her face from different angles and with different degrees of light and shadow. It was a time when the beautiful face of the heroine was more important than her acting talent for the director, the cameraman and the actress herself. From the moment she meets Kiriti for the first time at the hill station till the last minute when the two meet in the ancestral village home, Tapasi looks beautiful. Her good-for-nothing brothers are quick to point out that she holds a master's degree in English with a first class, can speak English like an Englishwoman, and can sing like a nightingale. This suits the purpose of the projected love story because Kiriti with his smashing looks, polished manner, high education and the elitist ‘stamp’ of a 10-year stay across the UK, Europe and the USA is considered the perfect match for Tapasi. Kiriti is the same Bulu now an adult, handsome, successful and eligible. Bulu chooses to become an impersonation of himself through Kiriti keeping his identity hidden from Tapasi and her family. This impersonation is triggered by his desire to see Tapasi go through an agni pareeksha — a trial by fire — holding back the truth to be revealed only if and when Tapasi emerges from the ordeal successfully. This ‘doubling’ as someone else, which amounts to misleading the lady he has fallen in love with, is not only marred by strong patriarchal notions but is also a betrayal of the trust Tapasi has placed in him because she does not know this is the same Bulu she was married to. In 1954, when the film was released, divorce was a sacrilegious term in Hindu marriages negotiated by the respective families and believed to be for an eternity or till ‘death do us part.’ No one calls Kiriti’s wilful impersonation a breach of faith because that is how patriarchal values dominated society and this was reflected in cinema. “Through her misrecognition, the narrative dramatizes the confrontation between tradition and modernity as the conflict between the ‘double’ Bulu and Kiriti. Although much of the film unfolds from her point of view, ultimately she remains a pawn in the hands of the primary male subject. Since the audience realizes the truth before the protagonist does, the transgressive potential of her desire for 'another' man is contained; it is her masochistic struggles that become the primary locus of spectatorial pleasure.” (Sarkar, Bhaskar. Mourning the Nation: Indian Cinema in the Wake of Partition, Duke University Press, Orient Blackswan Pvt. Ltd, 2010, p152, chapter 3) In hindsight, Agni Pareeksha threw up the complete screen compatibility of Uttam Kumar and Suchitra Sen, also unwittingly pointing out the differences between the stars in terms of their screen image and command of the craft of acting. Suchitra Sen as the grown-up Tapasi enters the frame after a good 20-odd minutes of the film's runtime. The entire story is from Tapasi’s point of view. Yet, once Kiriti steps in, she becomes the object of the cinematic gaze and the story being manipulated, first, by her mother, brother, aunts and cousins, then by her own traumatic past, and, finally, by Bulu pretending to be someone else. Uttam Kumar as Kiriti takes over smoothly once he enters Tapasi's life. He is suave, charming, attractive and mesmerizing, and in complete command of the drama he has created. Suchitra Sen as Tapasi is like a beautiful counterfoil, in suffering and in pain when her life changes with dark memories superimposed into her present. The child Tapasi, portrayed by Shikha Rani Bag, is a classic performance that reaches beyond the adult Tapasi. The expression of complete puzzlement and confusion on her face as her eyes wander from the bed of the dying zamindar to the chandelier hanging above to her bridegroom, not understanding what is going on, is very convincing. Agni Pareeksha became a super-duper hit at the time because it did not contravene audience expectation of conventional middle-class morality. Tapasi ultimately goes back to the man she was married to as a girl. There is no ideological conflict in this which might have steered the audience the other way. The music and the placing and orchestration of the love songs — 'Ke Tumi Aamare Dako', 'Gaane Mor Kon Indradhanu' and 'Jodi Bhool Korey Bhool Modhur Holo' give an added dimension to the screen romance between Tapasi and Kiriti both before and after Tapasi is disturbed by the trauma of her childhood marriage. The film set the pace for the electric chemistry between the lead pair played by Uttam Kumar and Suchitra Sen and remains a milestone in Bengali cinema. Postscriipt: When Uttam Kumar produced the same Agni Pareeksha as Chhotisi Mulaqat in Hindi in 1967 with Vyjayanthimala playing the role Suchitra Sen had essayed in the original, the film was a miserable flop. Uttam Kumar's fans blamed a conspiracy by some of the big producers in Bombay cinema at the time. But the basic reason was that the topic had become passé. The tale of a girl and a boy who get married as children and meet again when they grow up no longer held the audience captive. Besides, Uttam Kumar had gone past his handsome prime. He had simply chosen the wrong time to try his luck in the Hindi film industry. Uttam Kumar suffered huge losses and had a heart attack. He never tried his luck as a producer in Bombay again.

", "32 Or Ogni Porikkha, if you want to be phonetically correct. Over the last twenty-odd years, I’ve heard countless Bengalis rave about Uttam Kumar and Suchitra Sen as the ultimate onscreen romantic couple. I’ve seen both of them act (separately) in a few (admittedly Hindi) films, and have been very impressed. So, finally: an Uttam Kumar-Suchitra Sen film, and one that was a big hit too. Agni Pariksha: ‘trial by fire’. The story begins in the house of Mr Banerji (Kamal Mitra, identified by Sharmi—I need help identifying the cast in this film! The only people I can recognise are Uttam Kumar and Suchitra Sen). Mr Banerji and his wife Chitra (?) are off to visit her aunt in Mussoorie, while Mr Banerji’s elderly mother (?) is taking her three grandchildren—Mr Banerji’s offspring—with her to their ‘ancestral village’, their hometown. The three children, the teenaged Tapasi (?) and her younger brothers Siddharth ‘Siddhu’ (?) and Amitabh ‘Amit’ (?)—whoever heard of Bengali boys with pet names that were such civilised contractions of their actual names?!—are excited at the thought of going off with Grandma. Tapasi, in fact, decides to borrow some of her mother’s saris on the sly, so that she can wear them in the village. Frocks and skirts, as she tells her father, will be so out of place in the village. Chitra is not at all happy that her mother-in-law is taking the children to the village. Her mother-in-law is, in any case, not a big favourite with Chitra: Chitra thinks the old lady’s a stick-in-the-mud with fuddy-duddy ideas that belong in the 10th century. The fact that Mr Banerji’s father left all his vast wealth to his widow rather than to Mr Banerji just makes Chitra even more bitter. Anyway, Chitra and Mr Banerji go off to Mussoorie, while Grandma arrives in the village with Tapasi, Siddhu and Amit. Here, an old friend of the family, Mr Kanti Mukherji (?), invites Grandma and the children over to his home for some religious ceremonies centring round the installation of some idols. The group lands up at Kanti Mukherji’s palatial home (he’s the area’s wealthiest zamindar, a multi-millionaire landowner who’s highly respected). Mr Mukherji takes one look at Tapasi—who’s dressed up in her mother’s wedding sari for the occasion—and is immediately enchanted. While the children go off to participate in the festivities, Mr Mukherji asks Tapasi’s Grandma for Tapasi’s hand in marriage to Bulu (?, he at least conforms to the principles of pet name selection!), Mr Mukherji’s grandson and his sole surviving heir. Bulu is summoned, and is introduced to Grandma; it turns out he’s studying at the Presidency College in Calcutta. Grandma is rattled by Mr Mukherji’s proposal, but he uses emotional blackmail to finally get her consent. In any case, says Mr Mukherji: it’s not as if Tapasi and Bulu will get married right now; only when they’ve grown up. The festivities over, Grandma and the children have gone back to their own home when a servant comes to fetch them back to Mr Mukherji: he’s dying (he’d admitted earlier that he has cancer). They arrive, and Mr Mukheri springs a surprise: he wants Tapasi and Bulu married, now. Before he dies. Grandma is easily swayed, and before they know it, Tapasi and Bulu are married, and Mr Mukherji is dead. Tapasi’s father arrives in response to his mother’s telegram to him and is flabbergasted to find his little girl married. He takes her back to Calcutta, where Chitra—hastily summoned—arrives, to rave and rant and swear that she’ll wipe out all signs of Tapasi’s idiotic marriage. This traumatic incident has many fallouts. A grieving Grandma bequeaths her entire wealth to Tapasi, whilst allowing Rs 500 to be sent every month to Banaras, where Grandma now retires. Tapasi herself seems to have settled back into life as an urban schoolgirl. The only problem is that when she absently scribbles in her notebook, she goes on writing Bulu’s name. And she’s keen on learning how to drive; in fact, just the other day, she’s been on a drive all the way to Presidency College… …where, though she hasn’t met him since their disastrous wedding, Bulu too is thinking of Tapasi, absently writing her name when a friend asks him to test a new fountain pen. But then, disaster strikes again. Mr Banerji, plagued by sorrows and by Chitra’s incessant nagging, has a heart attack and dies. 12 years pass, and the next we know, Tapasi (now Suchitra Sen) is holidaying in Mussoorie, staying with her siblings and her mother at the house of Chitra’s aunt and her daughter Lily (?). One day, Tapasi’s out in the hills by herself when she meets a stranger (Uttam Kumar). His name’s Kirit Mukherji, and he’s a sweet, gentle man who tells her that the fog’s so thick, she’d better stay put until it clears. Which, of course, could take hours. Tapasi agrees, and when he asks her if she’s the well-known singer Tapasi Banerji (yes, Tapasi’s made a name for herself in the years gone by), she admits to it, and even obliges him by singing a song. Back home, Tapasi finds herself the object of much envy. Her ‘aunt’ Lily is openly jealous that the very wealthy, well-travelled Kirit Mukherji (who’s lived abroad for the past 10 years and has only recently come to Mussoorie) spent 2 whole hours with Tapasi. Lily’s mother tells Tapasi that Tapasi must introduce the entire family to Kirit—in the hope, obviously, that Kirit will fall for Lily. Tapasi’s mother is happy. And who wouldn’t be? Over the days that follow, Tapasi becomes increasingly friendly with Kirit. They spend a lot of time with each other, wandering in the hills, talking, Tapasi singing and Kirit listening. Tapasi tells Lily that she isn’t in love with Kirit; but all evidences point to the contrary. Especially when Tapasi gets a telegram summoning her to Calcutta—and visits Kirit late that evening to bid him farewell for the time being. Doesn’t this mean something more than mere friendship? Kirit thinks so, and from the note that Tapasi leaves for him (giving him her address in Calcutta) it seems she thinks so too. Kirit moves to Calcutta, and is invited to a party at Tapasi’s home. He’s a hit with Tapasi’s friends, and when he invites them to an outdoor party he’s hosting, everyone gladly agrees. Kirit’s party turns a bit sour when a bunch of hooligans, leering at all these fashionable women, tries to gatecrash the party. Kirit shows a bit of muscle and shoos off the miscreants, winning himself much praise—and Tapasi’s thinly-veiled affection. She makes it pretty obvious that she is in love with Kirit, and he reciprocates. Later that evening, though, things turn topsy-turvy. Kirit is driving Tapasi home, and has to stop the car along the way to allow a marriage procession to pass. Tapasi, looking out at the bride and groom—both mere teenagers—recoils in horror, suddenly reminded of her own long-ago wedding. Bulu. Kirit. Husband. Beloved. The past. The present. Which will Tapasi choose? And oh, the symbolism. Like Sita and her agni pariksha, Tapasi (very aptly named; ‘tapasi’ means ‘she who does penance’) Tapasi too ends up going through the flames of misery in order to emerge, hopefully, unscathed. Tapasi’s misery—her tormented existence, caught between a husband she doesn’t know, and a man who means the world to her—is, like Sita’s, not of her own making; it is the result of external forces. In Tapasi’s case, her grandmother’s and Kanti Mukherji’s ludicrous decision, followed by Chitra’s obstinate refusal to accept the marriage. But it is Tapasi, eventually, who must atone for all their sins too and face up to her destiny. This isn’t a path-breaking film (in fact, it can be considered pretty regressive in its condoning of child marriage), but it’s entertaining, and if you’re at all a lover of romances, there’s plenty here to leave you dewy-eyed. Very pretty. What I liked about this film: Uttam Kumar and Suchitra Sen. Include me in the Uttam Kumar-Suchitra Sen fan club, guys! These two are so good together. They look perfect, but more than that, it’s the chemistry between them—the playfulness and affection, the understanding, the emotional bonding, the passion… what more could one want from a convincing romantic couple onscreen? Superb. The music. Lots of lovely songs here, though my favourites are Gaane mor kon indradhanu and Aaj achhi kaal kothai (why does the latter sound familiar? Is there a similar tune in Hindi cinema?) What I didn’t like: The entire premise of the film—the justification of child marriage, that it is all right for people to be pushed around and their lives changed irrevocably simply because they happen to be too young to fend off elders who’re “doing it for your own good”. Ugh. Not nice at all. Some inexplicable flip-flops that characters do in the course of the film. For instance, Amit seems neutral towards Tapasi’s relationship with Kirit through most of the film; then, in one scene, he spews venom and seems to disapprove thoroughly; and the next time we see him, he’s back in Tapasi’s camp. And towards the end of the film, another character does a sudden and unconvincing about-turn that had me rolling my eyes. Little bit of trivia: Agni Pariksha was a big hit the year it was released. Its success prompted Uttam Kumar to, 13 years later (didn’t anyone tell him the number 13 is supposedly unlucky?!), remake it in Hindi as Chhoti si Mulaqat. He produced the film, which was directed by Alo Sircar and starred Vyjyantimala opposite Uttam Kumar. Chhoti si Mulaqat was a resounding flop and nearly bankrupted Uttam Kumar. Comparisons, comparisons: So how does Agni Pariksha compare with Chhoti si Mulaqat? Which is better? And why, possibly, did Chhoti si Mulaqat sink so badly while Agni Pariksha was such a hit? Some thoughts. Considering that 13 years (and what seems to be a fair bit of money) separated Agni Pariksha from Chhoti si Mulaqat, it’s hardly surprising that the latter wins in the more superficial details: more glamorous and obviously more expensive. The scenes in Shimla, for instance, are definitely shot there, on ski slopes and green hills; Agni Pariksha’s outdoor scenes are pretty obviously against backdrops painted with hills. But other than that advantage, Chhoti si Mulaqat falls well behind Agni Pariksha. For instance, its hero, Ashok, is not half as likeable as Kirit. Ashok is rather more the typical Hindi film hero of the 60’s (and to some extent the late 50’s): a self-assured, conceited young man who relentlessly pursues a girl until she cracks. Ashok’s pursuit of Rupa in fact almost smacks of stalking at times. And he emerges, ultimately, as a somewhat manipulative and self-centred individual whose actions are governed to a large extent by concerns other than his love for Rupa. Kirit, on the other hand, is portrayed as a caring, warm gentleman. His relationship with Tapasi is emphatically not of pursuer and pursued; I could easily relate to why Tapasi would fall in love with a man like this: he’s understanding, kind, and doesn’t try to bully her into loving him. And his actions, as he finally reveals, stem largely from his love for Tapasi. On the whole, a far more mature man than Ashok. Agni Pariksha is like that too: more evolved than Chhoti si Mulaqat, more progressive. That child marriage motif is there, of course: but it is suppressed by the highlighting of Tapasi and Kirit’s relationship, which becomes the central focus of the film. Chhoti si Mulaqat goes overboard when it comes to the revelation of Rupa’s past, what with everybody ostracising her. Similarly, the emphasis on a wife being forever bound to her husband—even if merely in name—gets tedious in Chhoti si Mulaqat, with Rupa being lectured (even by Ashok himself) on how nobody can come between a man and his wife—not even if the husband beats the wife, as they witness one day when a fisherwoman is abused by her husband. Agni Pariksha has more to recommend it. Though there are frequent mentions of how a Hindu woman, bound by the shastras to her husband, must always remain his, there is Kirit’s gentleness, Grandma’s own (occasional) remorse, and—most importantly—Kirit and Tapasi’s love story, to balance it. There is also the fact that Agni Pariksha is uncluttered when compared to Chhoti si Mulaqat: it has no irritating comic side plot and no vicious vamp (though Lily does pass some snide remarks) vying for the hero’s affections. And there is the fact that both Tapasi and Bulu are more adolescents than children when married—old enough to be infatuated with each other, even if not in love. My theory is that this somewhat more balanced approach, and the superb chemistry between Uttam Kumar and Suchitra Sen, was what made Agni Pariksha a hit. Also perhaps the fact that this was more than a decade older than Chhoti si Mulaqat—India, I assume, had moved on by 1967 and was less amenable to seeing films that glorified child marriage. If you want to watch Agni Pariksha online, it’s available (with English subtitles) on youtube, starting with part 1. This does sound a whole lot better than Chhoti Si Mulaqat with its stalker “love” story and its determinedly male-chauvinist outlook. A really good romance is enough to make me forgive the child-marriage aspects of it. :-) Speaking of child-marriage in Bollywood movies – wasn’t Balika Badhu one such? I vaguely remember a young Sachin singing Bade achhe lagte hain to his equally young bride. Back to Uttam-Suchitra – considering how believably they conveyed romance on-screen (for over 20 years, in more than 30 films!) isn’t it interesting that they never actually got together in real life?! Agni Pariksha is definitely a lot more progressive as a film than Chhoti si Mulaqat – ironic, considering it was made so much earlier! Kirit even tries to ‘tell’ Tapasi a few times, but she forces him to keep quiet, unaware of what he has to say. He’s a much, much more endearing character than Ashok. For anybody who likes romance, I’d certainly recommend this. I haven’t seen Balika Badhu, but I remember Bade achhe lagte hain: such a lovely song. Incidentally, another very unlikely candidate for the child-marriage element is Sahib Biwi aur Ghulam: it eventually turns out that Jaba and Bhootnath had been married to each other when they were children, so falling in love was such a happy accident! What excellent actors Suchitra Sen and Uttam Kumar were, right? To have never got on offscreen, but to have been so good onscreen – that takes some doing. They’re so convincing, it’s a pleasure to watch! Hey, you’ve written about a very famous Bengali film, a film that most of our parents dote on. Yes, I’ve seen it too. Mr Banerji in the film is Kamal Mitra. He was a very famous character actor those days. There are so many films featuring Uttam-Suchitra as the lead and they are so good!! Welcome to the Uttam-Suchitra lovers club!! Why don’t you try Chawa-Pawa, Pothey Holo Deri and Harano Sur. Very nice films…Great post!! Sharmi, thank you so much for all those recommendations! (and thank you for identifying Mr Banerji for me). Fortunately for me, Seventymm, the DVD rental company I subscribe to, has Pothey Holo Deri and Chawa-Pawa on their catalogue, so as soon as I’d finished watching Agni Pariksha, I put those on my wishlist too. Harano Sur has been recommended to me by a whole bunch of other people – including Tom Daniel, who did the work on that Johnny Walker songs compilation DVD – but Seventymm don’t have that with them. I guess I’ll probably have to order it from Induna. You know there are a host of films that these two actors did together. For instance, Sagarika (not very great). Oh, I forgot Saptapadhi….It’s simply superb. Watch it for Suchitra..she plays an anglo-indian over there. The films starts on a light note and then gets serious!!! Amazing performance by Chhabi Biswas also (he plays Uttam’s dad). Biswas was even bigger than Kamal Mitra. I’ll tell you of a very enjoyable Uttam-Tanuja film with great songs…Dewa-Newa…It’s a jolly good musical..watch it :) I saw Chotti si Mulaaqat quite a long time back and I didn’t like itmuch that time. In Agni Pariksha it seems though the marriage is showed in a better light or let us say it sounds more plausible. Both are teenagers and such. And also that they seem to love each other at time. But I think would still have qualms like you when watching it. How is the music? Chotti si Mulaqat had some good music. BallikaBadhu is also a story of child marriage, but the story takes place during the British Raj,w hen such things were quite common, but it doesn’t propogate it as a desirable marriage form. I thinkk it was done in quite a sensible manner. Sharmi: Deya Neya is already on my wishlist! As soon as I saw that the cast included Tanuja, I decided I had to see it. Looked for Saptapadi as well – Tom had recommended that too – but guess I’ll have to get it from induna. So many films, so little time… harvey: This one’s much better than Chhoti si Mulaqat, more mature and with less emphasis on the ‘tradition’ stuff – the grandmother and the father (while he’s alive) try to say a bit about that, but otherwise the film focuses on the Tapasi-Kirit relationship, and (towards the end of the film) Tapasi’s internal struggles. Best of all, as I mentioned in the review, is the character of Kirit – he’s a very nice person. Plus there’s the fact that Tapasi and Bulu are anyway old enough to feel something for each other; (they’re actually the same age as Rupa and Ashok were when they got married, but then maybe ‘childhood’ in 1954 ended earlier, figuratively, than childhood in 1967). Oh, and the music is very good! BTW: Another film that deals with child marriage is the Joy Mukherji-Rajshree starrer Ji Chahta Hai. Very good music, but a very avoidable film! I ahtwe watching movies on youtube as it does my back in, i have a desktop not a lap top but i might just brave this one out sometime, AS I WANT TO SEE HOW IT ALL ENDS, its nice to see some of these film companies are uploading movies wth Eng subs for free. I absolutely love Suchitra Sen ‘Is mod se jaate hain’ from Aandhi comes to mind when i think of her, such a gorge song and one of my all time fave Lata numbers It seems a lot of films were more “progressive” in tone early on than they became in the 60s and 70s :) Ah well. Everything is a cycle. I have a couple of Suchitra Sen-Uttam Kumar films to watch, must get to them!!! bollywooddeewana: Yes, prolonged sitting in front of a desktop can really mess up your back! My laptop has a 17″ screen, so almost counts as a desktop – but we went and got a special ergonomically designed chair, so I have no problems sitting at it for over 8 or 9 hours a day. I love Suchitra Sen too. Among her earlier films, a few I’d recommend are Devdas (though depressing, she at least has a good role); Bombai ka Babu and Mamta. The latter has fantastic songs too – especially Rahein na rahein hum and Rehte thhe kabhi jinke dil mein. memsaab: Pehchaan certainly sounded way more regressive than a lot of films that were made before 1970!! Tom sent you Harano Sur and was it Saptapadi…? He did mention it to me. I believe Harano Sur is a remake of the Ronald Colman-Greer Garson hit Random Harvest. Very highly praised by all my Bengali friends and relatives! This sounds good. I haven’t seen Chhoti Si Mulaquat . So I guess I’ll go ahead with this rather than the Hindi version. I have heard lots of people rave about Uttam-Suchitra chemistry…so really wanted to see them together at least in one movie. Whoever heard of Bengali boys with pet names that were such civilised contractions of their actual names – ROTFL Hehe! sunheriyaadein, I was wondering if anyone would bother to read that link! :-) It’s so cute – and so true. I am part Bengali, plus my sister is married to a Bengali, so I have platoons of relatives and ‘connections by marriage’ with the most outlandish pet names! The worst was when I had accompanied my sister and brother-in-law to Kolkata, and my brother-in-law took us to meet one of his cousins. The man is very well respected, a judge in the Calcutta High Court, but was introduced to me by his (very weird) pet name! I couldn’t bring myself to even address him by the name. Only learnt much later that his actual name is a very dignified one… Yeah…I remember you mentioning the judge – Doddy uncle, right? ;-) We had discussed about bengali nicknames sometime back here – https://dustedoff.wordpress.com/2009/10/30/samadhi-1950/ Bingo! Yes, Doddy Uncle. :-) And we have everybody from a Gulgul to a Gaga to a Gudul in the family. People with otherwise absolutely normal, often very dignified names, but everybody knows them only by their completely crazy pet names. Actually, in a way, it doesn’t support child marriage – just the sanctity of marriage once it is done. The hero says he did not want to claim the heroine by dint of the past; he did want to gain her acceptance and love by dint of who he is now. I wouldn’t call that a progressive agenda, but still. The main thing about the movie (and other Uttam Suchitra movies) is how much empathy they show for each other. Since they are so convincing, one comes back with the conclusion that they are really good at their craft. hey,back after a long time.was going through some really bad times,so could not keep in touch. well,you must watch Harano Sur,even though it has plot similarities with random harvest.The reason you should watch Harano sur is because it’s way better than Random Harvest [I’ am saying this after watching both the films.].Anyways,the fact that a film is a remake should never deter one from watching the film.After all, Saheb Biwi Aur Ghulam,Chupke Chupke,Bawarchi,Mere Apne,Angoor,Padosan,Prempatra,Safar,Khamoshi,Kala Pani,Hum Dono,Mamta,Kabuliwala etc are all remakes of Bengali originals,but that does not stop us from watching,loving and appreciating these hindi films. Hi Raunak, good to have you back here! I hope things have settled down for you now. I agree completely with you regarding remakes – just because a film is a remake (which can be, in some ways, I think a possibly good way of sharing a fine story with a wider audience) – doesn’t mean that a remake must be avoided. I must admit that other than Agni Pariksha, I’ve not seen the originals of any of the films you’ve named, but I’ll keep an eye out for it. I’ve especially been wanting to see Harano Sur – but, oh – if only I could find the time to first finish watching the heap of DVDs I already have at home! I am a fan of Suchitra Sen Uttam Kumar fan since seeing them in Pothe Holo Deri. What a lovely heartwarming pair. Since then I have seen them in Agnipriksha, ChawaPawa. Shap Mochan, Harano Sur, Shilpi, Deep jole jay, Sagorika, SabarUparey, Sare Chuhatar etc. Nexttime I am in Kolkata I wish to pay respects to this legend of bangla cinema. I donot tire of seeing this pair’s movies. I have been really wanting to watch Sagarika – I loved the Hindi remake of it (Prem Patra), so I am certain I’ll love the original too. Plus Harano Sur and Deep Jele Jai… all have been recommended to me. Chaowa Pawa I enjoyed a lot, and Saare Chuattar is lying in my to-watch pile. Will get around to it someday soon! Uttam Kumar and Suchitra Sen are really a joy to watch. :-) When you look at the bengali movies of those times (or even these times) look for the directors, Uttam and Suchitra had many bad (in my opinion, which may differ) , say Shapmochon, even Bipasha I consider average (but that is biased since I had read the novel, and then that had affected my judgement by comparison) movies too. Ajoy Kar, Agradoot, etc few had superbly used their capabilities. Uttam as any Bong would say is once in a history legend. Of the heroine, I flipflop between Suchitra and Sabitri with excellent movies there too Marutirtha Hinglaj (a Classic with capital C or may be all-caps), Nishipadma etc come to mind). I am not sure how many are there with subtitles. If I go for equivalence, Suchitra=Madhubala and Meena Kumari= Sabitri Thank you. You’ve actually enlightened me quite a bit, so I’m grateful for that. Especially since I don’t really recall seeing any of Sabitri Chatterjee’s films (though I have heard of her, obviously). Must amend that soon, perhaps with one of the films you suggest. I just hope I can get one with subtitles. Sabitri is part of the famous Triple-S heroines of Uttam (Suchitra, Sabitri, Supriya). Sabitri of these may be the most talented. Marutirtha Hinglaj I could see in Youtube to be in subtitled. The DVD of course too is with probably with subtitle, but since I keep the feature off, it distracts, so I can’t guarantee. There are certain excellent ones with Kaberi Bose (Shayamali, Ami Se O Sakha), Anjana Bhowmick (Nayika Sambad- excellent movie but equally poor print both in You as well as the official DVD) . Difficult to list them all. Thank you! Will look for the films you’ve suggested. Failing all else, I’m pretty sure Induna will have the subtitled DVDs of these films – they invariably do. My DVDs are usually from Induna, because of their huge collection and also because of the service and behavior.Very prompt in replacement and sometime they even go overboard (don’t even wait to get the defective back, add the replacement in my next order). There are some other plus points I saw there – in case of repeated errors in a product, they have withdrawn the disc from catalog etc which shows a customer-centric approach that I didn’t find Biggies doing. Only when a disc isn’t available with them and available elsewhere would I go out. A few times I suffer , currently I am waiting for my delivery from another supplier for an order of 7th, a simultaneous (next day) from Induna has been already delivered and watched. I haven’t ordered that often from Induna, but whenever I have, the experience has been very good. Very professional, very prompt and responsive. Others should learn from them! And with a Bong touch. The names don’t show them to be Bong though but they have made a “dada” of me (I would be more of a “Kaku” or “Jethu” – the uncles :-) in age. Hence a warning, if you become regular, you can soon be made a didi. Hehe. Or, once they discover my age, possibly a pishi. ;-) At the very least, a kaki. Just saw this film now, and I must admit the romance scenes between Uttam and Suchitra made me yawn. And the part where Kirit turns out to actually be Bulu was fairly predictable. However, it was quite a welcome break after watching all those Tamil / Malayalam artsy stuff. Plus, I must say that it was interesting watching Uttam Kumar’s first blockbuster. “However, it was quite a welcome break after watching all those Tamil / Malayalam artsy stuff. ” You have me at a disadvantage, there. The only artsy Malayalam or Tamil film I’ve seen has been Chemmeen. Such a paucity of old films that are subtitled. :-( Bengali films seem to be more easily available with subs. Try einthusan.com, that’s a place where you can watch several subtitled movies of Tamil and Malayalam. And the artsy movies that I am talking about are all pretty much from this decade. Most of the South Indian movies from the 60s are more or less Shammi Kapoor kind of films, with the only difference being that their far more gaudy and louder lol. I tried einthusan.com, but it’s been blocked. :-( Such is life. Fill in your details below or click an icon to log in: You are commenting using your WordPress.com account.

Over the last twenty-odd years, I’ve heard countless Bengalis rave about Uttam Kumar and Suchitra Sen as the ultimate onscreen romantic couple. I’ve seen both of them act (separately) in a few (admittedly Hindi) films, and have been very impressed. So, finally: an Uttam Kumar-Suchitra Sen film, and one that was a big hit too. Agni Pariksha: ‘trial by fire’. The story begins in the house of Mr Banerji (Kamal Mitra, identified by Sharmi—I need help identifying the cast in this film! The only people I can recognise are Uttam Kumar and Suchitra Sen). Mr Banerji and his wife Chitra (?) are off to visit her aunt in Mussoorie, while Mr Banerji’s elderly mother (?) is taking her three grandchildren—Mr Banerji’s offspring—with her to their ‘ancestral village’, their hometown. The three children, the teenaged Tapasi (?) and her younger brothers Siddharth ‘Siddhu’ (?) and Amitabh ‘Amit’ (?)—whoever heard of Bengali boys with pet names that were such civilised contractions of their actual names?!—are excited at the thought of going off with Grandma. Tapasi, in fact, decides to borrow some of her mother’s saris on the sly, so that she can wear them in the village. Frocks and skirts, as she tells her father, will be so out of place in the village. Chitra is not at all happy that her mother-in-law is taking the children to the village. Her mother-in-law is, in any case, not a big favourite with Chitra: Chitra thinks the old lady’s a stick-in-the-mud with fuddy-duddy ideas that belong in the 10th century. The fact that Mr Banerji’s father left all his vast wealth to his widow rather than to Mr Banerji just makes Chitra even more bitter. Anyway, Chitra and Mr Banerji go off to Mussoorie, while Grandma arrives in the village with Tapasi, Siddhu and Amit. Here, an old friend of the family, Mr Kanti Mukherji (?), invites Grandma and the children over to his home for some religious ceremonies centring round the installation of some idols. The group lands up at Kanti Mukherji’s palatial home (he’s the area’s wealthiest zamindar, a multi-millionaire landowner who’s highly respected). Mr Mukherji takes one look at Tapasi—who’s dressed up in her mother’s wedding sari for the occasion—and is immediately enchanted. While the children go off to participate in the festivities, Mr Mukherji asks Tapasi’s Grandma for Tapasi’s hand in marriage to Bulu (?, he at least conforms to the principles of pet name selection!), Mr Mukherji’s grandson and his sole surviving heir. Bulu is summoned, and is introduced to Grandma; it turns out he’s studying at the Presidency College in Calcutta. Grandma is rattled by Mr Mukherji’s proposal, but he uses emotional blackmail to finally get her consent. In any case, says Mr Mukherji: it’s not as if Tapasi and Bulu will get married right now; only when they’ve grown up. The festivities over, Grandma and the children have gone back to their own home when a servant comes to fetch them back to Mr Mukherji: he’s dying (he’d admitted earlier that he has cancer). They arrive, and Mr Mukheri springs a surprise: he wants Tapasi and Bulu married, now. Before he dies. Grandma is easily swayed, and before they know it, Tapasi and Bulu are married, and Mr Mukherji is dead. Tapasi’s father arrives in response to his mother’s telegram to him and is flabbergasted to find his little girl married. He takes her back to Calcutta, where Chitra—hastily summoned—arrives, to rave and rant and swear that she’ll wipe out all signs of Tapasi’s idiotic marriage. This traumatic incident has many fallouts. A grieving Grandma bequeaths her entire wealth to Tapasi, whilst allowing Rs 500 to be sent every month to Banaras, where Grandma now retires. Tapasi herself seems to have settled back into life as an urban schoolgirl. The only problem is that when she absently scribbles in her notebook, she goes on writing Bulu’s name. And she’s keen on learning how to drive; in fact, just the other day, she’s been on a drive all the way to Presidency College… …where, though she hasn’t met him since their disastrous wedding, Bulu too is thinking of Tapasi, absently writing her name when a friend asks him to test a new fountain pen. But then, disaster strikes again. Mr Banerji, plagued by sorrows and by Chitra’s incessant nagging, has a heart attack and dies. 12 years pass, and the next we know, Tapasi (now Suchitra Sen) is holidaying in Mussoorie, staying with her siblings and her mother at the house of Chitra’s aunt and her daughter Lily (?). One day, Tapasi’s out in the hills by herself when she meets a stranger (Uttam Kumar). His name’s Kirit Mukherji, and he’s a sweet, gentle man who tells her that the fog’s so thick, she’d better stay put until it clears. Which, of course, could take hours. Tapasi agrees, and when he asks her if she’s the well-known singer Tapasi Banerji (yes, Tapasi’s made a name for herself in the years gone by), she admits to it, and even obliges him by singing a song. Back home, Tapasi finds herself the object of much envy. Her ‘aunt’ Lily is openly jealous that the very wealthy, well-travelled Kirit Mukherji (who’s lived abroad for the past 10 years and has only recently come to Mussoorie) spent 2 whole hours with Tapasi. Lily’s mother tells Tapasi that Tapasi must introduce the entire family to Kirit—in the hope, obviously, that Kirit will fall for Lily. Tapasi’s mother is happy. And who wouldn’t be? Over the days that follow, Tapasi becomes increasingly friendly with Kirit. They spend a lot of time with each other, wandering in the hills, talking, Tapasi singing and Kirit listening. Tapasi tells Lily that she isn’t in love with Kirit; but all evidences point to the contrary. Especially when Tapasi gets a telegram summoning her to Calcutta—and visits Kirit late that evening to bid him farewell for the time being. Doesn’t this mean something more than mere friendship? Kirit thinks so, and from the note that Tapasi leaves for him (giving him her address in Calcutta) it seems she thinks so too. Kirit moves to Calcutta, and is invited to a party at Tapasi’s home. He’s a hit with Tapasi’s friends, and when he invites them to an outdoor party he’s hosting, everyone gladly agrees. Kirit’s party turns a bit sour when a bunch of hooligans, leering at all these fashionable women, tries to gatecrash the party. Kirit shows a bit of muscle and shoos off the miscreants, winning himself much praise—and Tapasi’s thinly-veiled affection. She makes it pretty obvious that she is in love with Kirit, and he reciprocates. Later that evening, though, things turn topsy-turvy. Kirit is driving Tapasi home, and has to stop the car along the way to allow a marriage procession to pass. Tapasi, looking out at the bride and groom—both mere teenagers—recoils in horror, suddenly reminded of her own long-ago wedding. Bulu. Kirit. Husband. Beloved. The past. The present. Which will Tapasi choose? And oh, the symbolism. Like Sita and her agni pariksha, Tapasi (very aptly named; ‘tapasi’ means ‘she who does penance’) Tapasi too ends up going through the flames of misery in order to emerge, hopefully, unscathed. Tapasi’s misery—her tormented existence, caught between a husband she doesn’t know, and a man who means the world to her—is, like Sita’s, not of her own making; it is the result of external forces. In Tapasi’s case, her grandmother’s and Kanti Mukherji’s ludicrous decision, followed by Chitra’s obstinate refusal to accept the marriage. But it is Tapasi, eventually, who must atone for all their sins too and face up to her destiny. This isn’t a path-breaking film (in fact, it can be considered pretty regressive in its condoning of child marriage), but it’s entertaining, and if you’re at all a lover of romances, there’s plenty here to leave you dewy-eyed. Very pretty. What I liked about this film: Uttam Kumar and Suchitra Sen. Include me in the Uttam Kumar-Suchitra Sen fan club, guys! These two are so good together. They look perfect, but more than that, it’s the chemistry between them—the playfulness and affection, the understanding, the emotional bonding, the passion… what more could one want from a convincing romantic couple onscreen? Superb. The music. Lots of lovely songs here, though my favourites are Gaane mor kon indradhanu and Aaj achhi kaal kothai (why does the latter sound familiar? Is there a similar tune in Hindi cinema?) What I didn’t like: The entire premise of the film—the justification of child marriage, that it is all right for people to be pushed around and their lives changed irrevocably simply because they happen to be too young to fend off elders who’re “doing it for your own good”. Ugh. Not nice at all. Some inexplicable flip-flops that characters do in the course of the film. For instance, Amit seems neutral towards Tapasi’s relationship with Kirit through most of the film; then, in one scene, he spews venom and seems to disapprove thoroughly; and the next time we see him, he’s back in Tapasi’s camp. And towards the end of the film, another character does a sudden and unconvincing about-turn that had me rolling my eyes. Little bit of trivia: Agni Pariksha was a big hit the year it was released. Its success prompted Uttam Kumar to, 13 years later (didn’t anyone tell him the number 13 is supposedly unlucky?!), remake it in Hindi as Chhoti si Mulaqat. He produced the film, which was directed by Alo Sircar and starred Vyjyantimala opposite Uttam Kumar. Chhoti si Mulaqat was a resounding flop and nearly bankrupted Uttam Kumar. Comparisons, comparisons: So how does Agni Pariksha compare with Chhoti si Mulaqat? Which is better? And why, possibly, did Chhoti si Mulaqat sink so badly while Agni Pariksha was such a hit? Some thoughts. Considering that 13 years (and what seems to be a fair bit of money) separated Agni Pariksha from Chhoti si Mulaqat, it’s hardly surprising that the latter wins in the more superficial details: more glamorous and obviously more expensive. The scenes in Shimla, for instance, are definitely shot there, on ski slopes and green hills; Agni Pariksha’s outdoor scenes are pretty obviously against backdrops painted with hills. But other than that advantage, Chhoti si Mulaqat falls well behind Agni Pariksha. For instance, its hero, Ashok, is not half as likeable as Kirit. Ashok is rather more the typical Hindi film hero of the 60’s (and to some extent the late 50’s): a self-assured, conceited young man who relentlessly pursues a girl until she cracks. Ashok’s pursuit of Rupa in fact almost smacks of stalking at times. And he emerges, ultimately, as a somewhat manipulative and self-centred individual whose actions are governed to a large extent by concerns other than his love for Rupa. Kirit, on the other hand, is portrayed as a caring, warm gentleman. His relationship with Tapasi is emphatically not of pursuer and pursued; I could easily relate to why Tapasi would fall in love with a man like this: he’s understanding, kind, and doesn’t try to bully her into loving him. And his actions, as he finally reveals, stem largely from his love for Tapasi. On the whole, a far more mature man than Ashok. Agni Pariksha is like that too: more evolved than Chhoti si Mulaqat, more progressive. That child marriage motif is there, of course: but it is suppressed by the highlighting of Tapasi and Kirit’s relationship, which becomes the central focus of the film. Chhoti si Mulaqat goes overboard when it comes to the revelation of Rupa’s past, what with everybody ostracising her. Similarly, the emphasis on a wife being forever bound to her husband—even if merely in name—gets tedious in Chhoti si Mulaqat, with Rupa being lectured (even by Ashok himself) on how nobody can come between a man and his wife—not even if the husband beats the wife, as they witness one day when a fisherwoman is abused by her husband. Agni Pariksha has more to recommend it. Though there are frequent mentions of how a Hindu woman, bound by the shastras to her husband, must always remain his, there is Kirit’s gentleness, Grandma’s own (occasional) remorse, and—most importantly—Kirit and Tapasi’s love story, to balance it. There is also the fact that Agni Pariksha is uncluttered when compared to Chhoti si Mulaqat: it has no irritating comic side plot and no vicious vamp (though Lily does pass some snide remarks) vying for the hero’s affections. And there is the fact that both Tapasi and Bulu are more adolescents than children when married—old enough to be infatuated with each other, even if not in love. My theory is that this somewhat more balanced approach, and the superb chemistry between Uttam Kumar and Suchitra Sen, was what made Agni Pariksha a hit. Also perhaps the fact that this was more than a decade older than Chhoti si Mulaqat—India, I assume, had moved on by 1967 and was less amenable to seeing films that glorified child marriage. If you want to watch Agni Pariksha online, it’s available (with English subtitles) on youtube, starting with part 1.

A really good romance is enough to make me forgive the child-marriage aspects of it. :-) Speaking of child-marriage in Bollywood movies – wasn’t Balika Badhu one such? I vaguely remember a young Sachin singing Bade achhe lagte hain to his equally young bride. Back to Uttam-Suchitra – considering how believably they conveyed romance on-screen (for over 20 years, in more than 30 films!) isn’t it interesting that they never actually got together in real life?! Reply dustedoff June 7, 2010 at 5:26 am Agni Pariksha is definitely a lot more progressive as a film than Chhoti si Mulaqat – ironic, considering it was made so much earlier! Kirit even tries to ‘tell’ Tapasi a few times, but she forces him to keep quiet, unaware of what he has to say. He’s a much, much more endearing character than Ashok. For anybody who likes romance, I’d certainly recommend this. I haven’t seen Balika Badhu, but I remember Bade achhe lagte hain: such a lovely song. Incidentally, another very unlikely candidate for the child-marriage element is Sahib Biwi aur Ghulam: it eventually turns out that Jaba and Bhootnath had been married to each other when they were children, so falling in love was such a happy accident! What excellent actors Suchitra Sen and Uttam Kumar were, right? To have never got on offscreen, but to have been so good onscreen – that takes some doing. They’re so convincing, it’s a pleasure to watch! Reply Sharmi June 7, 2010 at 7:54 am Hey, you’ve written about a very famous Bengali film, a film that most of our parents dote on. Yes, I’ve seen it too. Mr Banerji in the film is Kamal Mitra. He was a very famous character actor those days. There are so many films featuring Uttam-Suchitra as the lead and they are so good!! Welcome to the Uttam-Suchitra lovers club!! Why don’t you try Chawa-Pawa, Pothey Holo Deri and Harano Sur. Very nice films…Great post!! Reply dustedoff June 7, 2010 at 10:34 am Sharmi, thank you so much for all those recommendations! (and thank you for identifying Mr Banerji for me). Fortunately for me, Seventymm, the DVD rental company I subscribe to, has Pothey Holo Deri and Chawa-Pawa on their catalogue, so as soon as I’d finished watching Agni Pariksha, I put those on my wishlist too. Harano Sur has been recommended to me by a whole bunch of other people – including Tom Daniel, who did the work on that Johnny Walker songs compilation DVD – but Seventymm don’t have that with them. I guess I’ll probably have to order it from Induna. Reply Sharmi June 7, 2010 at 2:39 pm You know there are a host of films that these two actors did together. For instance, Sagarika (not very great). Oh, I forgot Saptapadhi….It’s simply superb. Watch it for Suchitra..she plays an anglo-indian over there. The films starts on a light note and then gets serious!!! Amazing performance by Chhabi Biswas also (he plays Uttam’s dad). Biswas was even bigger than Kamal Mitra. I’ll tell you of a very enjoyable Uttam-Tanuja film with great songs…Dewa-Newa…It’s a jolly good musical..watch it :) Reply harvey June 7, 2010 at 6:27 pm I saw Chotti si Mulaaqat quite a long time back and I didn’t like itmuch that time. In Agni Pariksha it seems though the marriage is showed in a better light or let us say it sounds more plausible. Both are teenagers and such. And also that they seem to love each other at time. But I think would still have qualms like you when watching it. How is the music? Chotti si Mulaqat had some good music. Reply harvey June 7, 2010 at 6:29 pm BallikaBadhu is also a story of child marriage, but the story takes place during the British Raj,w hen such things were quite common, but it doesn’t propogate it as a desirable marriage form. I thinkk it was done in quite a sensible manner. Reply dustedoff June 8, 2010 at 3:53 am Sharmi: Deya Neya is already on my wishlist! As soon as I saw that the cast included Tanuja, I decided I had to see it. Looked for Saptapadi as well – Tom had recommended that too – but guess I’ll have to get it from induna. So many films, so little time… harvey: This one’s much better than Chhoti si Mulaqat, more mature and with less emphasis on the ‘tradition’ stuff – the grandmother and the father (while he’s alive) try to say a bit about that, but otherwise the film focuses on the Tapasi-Kirit relationship, and (towards the end of the film) Tapasi’s internal struggles. Best of all, as I mentioned in the review, is the character of Kirit – he’s a very nice person. Plus there’s the fact that Tapasi and Bulu are anyway old enough to feel something for each other; (they’re actually the same age as Rupa and Ashok were when they got married, but then maybe ‘childhood’ in 1954 ended earlier, figuratively, than childhood in 1967). Oh, and the music is very good! BTW: Another film that deals with child marriage is the Joy Mukherji-Rajshree starrer Ji Chahta Hai. Very good music, but a very avoidable film! Reply bollywooddeewana June 8, 2010 at 3:19 pm I ahtwe watching movies on youtube as it does my back in, i have a desktop not a lap top but i might just brave this one out sometime, AS I WANT TO SEE HOW IT ALL ENDS, its nice to see some of these film companies are uploading movies wth Eng subs for free. I absolutely love Suchitra Sen ‘Is mod se jaate hain’ from Aandhi comes to mind when i think of her, such a gorge song and one of my all time fave Lata numbers Reply memsaab June 8, 2010 at 7:42 pm It seems a lot of films were more “progressive” in tone early on than they became in the 60s and 70s :) Ah well. Everything is a cycle. I have a couple of Suchitra Sen-Uttam Kumar films to watch, must get to them!!! Reply dustedoff June 9, 2010 at 4:59 am bollywooddeewana: Yes, prolonged sitting in front of a desktop can really mess up your back! My laptop has a 17″ screen, so almost counts as a desktop – but we went and got a special ergonomically designed chair, so I have no problems sitting at it for over 8 or 9 hours a day. I love Suchitra Sen too. Among her earlier films, a few I’d recommend are Devdas (though depressing, she at least has a good role); Bombai ka Babu and Mamta. The latter has fantastic songs too – especially Rahein na rahein hum and Rehte thhe kabhi jinke dil mein. memsaab: Pehchaan certainly sounded way more regressive than a lot of films that were made before 1970!! Tom sent you Harano Sur and was it Saptapadi…? He did mention it to me. I believe Harano Sur is a remake of the Ronald Colman-Greer Garson hit Random Harvest. Very highly praised by all my Bengali friends and relatives! Reply sunheriyaadein June 12, 2010 at 7:51 pm This sounds good. I haven’t seen Chhoti Si Mulaquat . So I guess I’ll go ahead with this rather than the Hindi version. I have heard lots of people rave about Uttam-Suchitra chemistry…so really wanted to see them together at least in one movie. Whoever heard of Bengali boys with pet names that were such civilised contractions of their actual names – ROTFL Reply dustedoff June 13, 2010 at 9:25 am Hehe! sunheriyaadein, I was wondering if anyone would bother to read that link! :-) It’s so cute – and so true. I am part Bengali, plus my sister is married to a Bengali, so I have platoons of relatives and ‘connections by marriage’ with the most outlandish pet names! The worst was when I had accompanied my sister and brother-in-law to Kolkata, and my brother-in-law took us to meet one of his cousins. The man is very well respected, a judge in the Calcutta High Court, but was introduced to me by his (very weird) pet name! I couldn’t bring myself to even address him by the name. Only learnt much later that his actual name is a very dignified one… Reply sunheriyaadein June 14, 2010 at 7:28 pm Yeah…I remember you mentioning the judge – Doddy uncle, right? ;-) We had discussed about bengali nicknames sometime back here – https://dustedoff.wordpress.com/2009/10/30/samadhi-1950/ Reply dustedoff June 15, 2010 at 4:03 am Bingo! Yes, Doddy Uncle. :-) And we have everybody from a Gulgul to a Gaga to a Gudul in the family. People with otherwise absolutely normal, often very dignified names, but everybody knows them only by their completely crazy pet names. Reply Sue February 7, 2011 at 7:22 pm Actually, in a way, it doesn’t support child marriage – just the sanctity of marriage once it is done. The hero says he did not want to claim the heroine by dint of the past; he did want to gain her acceptance and love by dint of who he is now. I wouldn’t call that a progressive agenda, but still. The main thing about the movie (and other Uttam Suchitra movies) is how much empathy they show for each other. Since they are so convincing, one comes back with the conclusion that they are really good at their craft. Reply raunak August 19, 2012 at 11:56 am hey,back after a long time.was going through some really bad times,so could not keep in touch. well,you must watch Harano Sur,even though it has plot similarities with random harvest.The reason you should watch Harano sur is because it’s way better than Random Harvest [I’ am saying this after watching both the films.].Anyways,the fact that a film is a remake should never deter one from watching the film.After all, Saheb Biwi Aur Ghulam,Chupke Chupke,Bawarchi,Mere Apne,Angoor,Padosan,Prempatra,Safar,Khamoshi,Kala Pani,Hum Dono,Mamta,Kabuliwala etc are all remakes of Bengali originals,but that does not stop us from watching,loving and appreciating these hindi films. Reply dustedoff August 20, 2012 at 4:29 am Hi Raunak, good to have you back here! I hope things have settled down for you now. I agree completely with you regarding remakes – just because a film is a remake (which can be, in some ways, I think a possibly good way of sharing a fine story with a wider audience) – doesn’t mean that a remake must be avoided. I must admit that other than Agni Pariksha, I’ve not seen the originals of any of the films you’ve named, but I’ll keep an eye out for it. I’ve especially been wanting to see Harano Sur – but, oh – if only I could find the time to first finish watching the heap of DVDs I already have at home! Reply Rahman November 6, 2013 at 1:47 pm I am a fan of Suchitra Sen Uttam Kumar fan since seeing them in Pothe Holo Deri. What a lovely heartwarming pair. Since then I have seen them in Agnipriksha, ChawaPawa. Shap Mochan, Harano Sur, Shilpi, Deep jole jay, Sagorika, SabarUparey, Sare Chuhatar etc. Nexttime I am in Kolkata I wish to pay respects to this legend of bangla cinema. I donot tire of seeing this pair’s movies. Reply dustedoff November 7, 2013 at 4:17 am I have been really wanting to watch Sagarika – I loved the Hindi remake of it (Prem Patra), so I am certain I’ll love the original too. Plus Harano Sur and Deep Jele Jai… all have been recommended to me. Chaowa Pawa I enjoyed a lot, and Saare Chuattar is lying in my to-watch pile. Will get around to it someday soon! Uttam Kumar and Suchitra Sen are really a joy to watch. :-) Reply sbasu September 24, 2015 at 11:26 am When you look at the bengali movies of those times (or even these times) look for the directors, Uttam and Suchitra had many bad (in my opinion, which may differ) , say Shapmochon, even Bipasha I consider average (but that is biased since I had read the novel, and then that had affected my judgement by comparison) movies too. Ajoy Kar, Agradoot, etc few had superbly used their capabilities. Uttam as any Bong would say is once in a history legend. Of the heroine, I flipflop between Suchitra and Sabitri with excellent movies there too Marutirtha Hinglaj (a Classic with capital C or may be all-caps), Nishipadma etc come to mind). I am not sure how many are there with subtitles. If I go for equivalence, Suchitra=Madhubala and Meena Kumari= Sabitri Reply dustedoff September 25, 2015 at 3:42 am Thank you. You’ve actually enlightened me quite a bit, so I’m grateful for that. Especially since I don’t really recall seeing any of Sabitri Chatterjee’s films (though I have heard of her, obviously). Must amend that soon, perhaps with one of the films you suggest. I just hope I can get one with subtitles. Reply sbasu September 27, 2015 at 6:45 pm Sabitri is part of the famous Triple-S heroines of Uttam (Suchitra, Sabitri, Supriya). Sabitri of these may be the most talented. Marutirtha Hinglaj I could see in Youtube to be in subtitled. The DVD of course too is with probably with subtitle, but since I keep the feature off, it distracts, so I can’t guarantee. There are certain excellent ones with Kaberi Bose (Shayamali, Ami Se O Sakha), Anjana Bhowmick (Nayika Sambad- excellent movie but equally poor print both in You as well as the official DVD) . Difficult to list them all. Reply dustedoff September 28, 2015 at 3:34 am Thank you! Will look for the films you’ve suggested. Failing all else, I’m pretty sure Induna will have the subtitled DVDs of these films – they invariably do. Reply sbasu September 29, 2015 at 2:32 am My DVDs are usually from Induna, because of their huge collection and also because of the service and behavior.Very prompt in replacement and sometime they even go overboard (don’t even wait to get the defective back, add the replacement in my next order). There are some other plus points I saw there – in case of repeated errors in a product, they have withdrawn the disc from catalog etc which shows a customer-centric approach that I didn’t find Biggies doing. Only when a disc isn’t available with them and available elsewhere would I go out. A few times I suffer , currently I am waiting for my delivery from another supplier for an order of 7th, a simultaneous (next day) from Induna has been already delivered and watched. Reply dustedoff September 29, 2015 at 7:23 am I haven’t ordered that often from Induna, but whenever I have, the experience has been very good. Very professional, very prompt and responsive. Others should learn from them! Reply sbasu September 29, 2015 at 11:47 am And with a Bong touch. The names don’t show them to be Bong though but they have made a “dada” of me (I would be more of a “Kaku” or “Jethu” – the uncles :-) in age. Hence a warning, if you become regular, you can soon be made a didi. Reply dustedoff September 30, 2015 at 3:50 am Hehe. Or, once they discover my age, possibly a pishi. ;-) At the very least, a kaki. Reply Vishwanathan February 15, 2020 at 11:18 pm Just saw this film now, and I must admit the romance scenes between Uttam and Suchitra made me yawn. And the part where Kirit turns out to actually be Bulu was fairly predictable. However, it was quite a welcome break after watching all those Tamil / Malayalam artsy stuff. Plus, I must say that it was interesting watching Uttam Kumar’s first blockbuster. Reply dustedoff February 16, 2020 at 11:29 am “However, it was quite a welcome break after watching all those Tamil / Malayalam artsy stuff. ” You have me at a disadvantage, there. The only artsy Malayalam or Tamil film I’ve seen has been Chemmeen. Such a paucity of old films that are subtitled. :-( Bengali films seem to be more easily available with subs. Reply Vishwanathan February 16, 2020 at 8:14 pm Try einthusan.com, that’s a place where you can watch several subtitled movies of Tamil and Malayalam. And the artsy movies that I am talking about are all pretty much from this decade. Most of the South Indian movies from the 60s are more or less Shammi Kapoor kind of films, with the only difference being that their far more gaudy and louder lol. Reply dustedoff February 17, 2020 at 11:42 am I tried einthusan.com, but it’s been blocked. :-( Such is life.

It is a simple tale of a rich boy and poor girl, coming from different religious background, cementing their childhood association with the wedding bond. We have seen many such plots in Hindi cinema but this one is so brilliantly delivered, thanks to the directorial skills of Shakti Samanta. For Uttam Kumar, adhering to the demands of the script was a natural phenomenon. He had given a sterling performance in “Amanush”, which was also a Samanta offering with Sharmila Tagore as his lady love which again like “Anand Ashram” was a double version film in Hindi and Bangla by the director. But “Anand Ashram” throws light on the acting prowess of a star line up that includes Ashok Kumar and Asit Sen with Rakesh Roshan and Moushami Chatterjee completing the cast. Uttam Kumar and Sharmila Tagore gave their best when working with Satyajit Ray. Uttam achieved a legendary status with “Nayak” while Sharmila, after initial forays in Bengali cinema, ventured into the world of Hindi films, bagging plenty of glamorous roles but reserved her finest for “Amar Prem” and “Aradhana”, both coming from the stable of Samanta. “Anand Ashram” was aimed at giving the message that rural India needed the services of good doctors and the protagonist of the story Deepak (Uttam Kumar) dreams of a similar project. In the process he encounters Asha and they are wedded even as Deepak faces a stern father Pratap Narayan (Ashok Kumar) who would not accept a Christian as her daughter-in-law. The broad-minded son defies his father’s dictates and walks out of the house to chase his drams in a village. Deepak’s world is shattered when Asha dies during a complicated delivery. Faced with the tough task of raising his son, Deepak accedes to request from an elderly help Girdhari (Asit Sen) who raises the child as Prakash (Rakesh Roshan) without revealing his identity to his grandfather. Prakash goes on to become a doctor and also travels overseas for studies, thus fulfilling a wish of his late mother. Deepak follows his son’s progress like a proud father but confronts him when the former commits to work in a pharmaceutical company. Deepak coaxes the young doctor to spare his services for the needy in rural areas and Prakash comes to accept the noble suggestion out of respect for the elderly person, still unaware of their relationship. Circumstances lead Prakash to Kiran (Moushami Chatterjee) and ultimately his father’s identity is known to him when Girdhari spills the secret to Pratap Narayan. The emotional climax is in keeping with Samanta’s style but what stands out is each individual emerging with a neat show. For old timers, used to watching Asit Sen’s comic acts, this is a refreshing change as he makes his presence felt brilliantly. It is Uttam Kumar’s commanding performance that leaves an impression on the viewer, especially the latter stage of his character when he carries himself with distinction. At no point does he indulge in histrionics. The director in fact does not allow anyone to drift from the balanced narration. The scene where Deepak parts from his father, citing ideological differences, is a Samanta special, emotions in control and no high-pitch dialogues for creating an impact. Uttam Kumar’s work was immensely appreciated by critics and fans because of his ability to hold his place against a stalwart like Ashok Kumar. The cast was a recipe for success even though the film did not quite conquer the box office, not even its Bangla version, but it was a quality product nevertheless by a collection of distinguished artists. The presence of Uttam Kumar and Ashok Kumar ensured class on the screen, not to forget the cameo of Utpal Dutt, as Kiran’s father and sponsor of the young Deepak’s dream of setting up medical facilities in a rural area. The banter between Rakesh Roshan and Moushami Chatterjee rekindled memories of similar Rajesh Khanna-Farida Jalal encounters from “Aradhana”, which saw Samanta extract a memorable contribution from Sharmila Tagore. Shyamal Mitra, an under-rated music director, lent some lilting compositions where Kishore Kumar’s “Rahi Naye Naye Rasta Naya Naya” and his duet with Asha Bhosle “Sara Pyaar Tumhara Maine” stood out for melody. Regardless of the general response from the fans this is a film worth a revisit.

Kolkata - 10 Apr 2018 12:30 IST Updated : 12 Apr 2018 12:41 IST Roushni Sarkar One cannot help but refer to filmmaker Shakti Samanta’s immortal creations when it comes to the romantic classics of the golden era of Hindi cinema. According to Bengali critic Kantiranjan De, the creator of Kashmir Ki Kali (1964), An Evening in Paris (1967), Aradhana (1969), Kati Patang (1970), Amar Prem (1972); thoughtfully catered to all the nuances that are required for successful commercial films, but always made sure he stayed connected to his roots in Bengal. The student of Calcutta University and an aspiring hero, Samanta decided to shift his goal to direction as he started working with Bengali film director Phani Majumdar, who was then considered to be an institution himself, in Bombay. As De would point out, Samanta received his first break with Howrah Bridge (1958), a film with a title that refers to the historical architecture from Bengal and major parts of the film were shot in various locations around Calcutta. With various Hindi commercial hits to his credits, Samanta decided to make films in both Hindi and Bengali in the later phase of his career. National award winning filmmaker Prabhat Roy, director of Shwet Patharer Thala (1992), Lathi (1996) and many other successful commercial Bengali films, joined Shakti Films as an assistant since the making of Charitraheen (1974). He gradually came to play a more important role as Samanta went on to make films in double versions and Roy got assigned with the task of writing the Bengali scripts of Aradhana (1969), Amanush (1975) and Anand Ashram (1977). Roy, who considers working as an assistant director for Samanta’s Anusandhan (1981) to be a turning point in his career, speaks of the motivations and inspirations that prompted the director to work for the Bengali film industry with his ingenious style and also shares fond memories with his mentor. Apart from the ones mentioned above, Samanta also made Anyay Abichar (1985), Andha Bichar (1990) and Devdas (2002) in Bengali. On Samanta's 9th death anniversary (he passed away on 9 April 2009), we spoke to Roy about his mentor's style of working, Bengali roots and fond memories. Excerpts from the interview: Shakti Samanta had already established himself as one of the most successful commercial directors in Hindi cinema. Why did he suddenly decide to make films in the language of his roots? I had started to work with Shakti da since 1973. During that time he suddenly felt the need to dub one of his most successful films Aradhana (1969) in Bengali. There was no prohibition on dubbing big budget Hindi films in Bengali then, unlike the present time. Knowing my aptitude, he asked me to write down the dialogues in Bengali and hence, Aradhana, in which the majority of the artistes were Bengali — Sharmila Tagore, Ashok Kumar and Anita Guha — was released with a Bengali version. The successful initiative pushed Shakti da towards making more films in Bengali. He conceived the idea of Amanush based on acclaimed Bengali writer Shaktipada Rajguru’s story and again I was involved in the script writing. The powerful cast of Uttam Kumar, Sharmila Tagore, Utpal Dutt and Anil Chatterjee delivered a box-office hit. Thus, a new chapter unfolded in Shakti da’s career and he eventually made Anand Ashram again with Uttam Kumar, Sharmila Tagore along with Ashok Kumar and Anusandhan with Amitabh Bachchan, Rakhee Gulzar, Utpal Dutt and Amjad Khan in Bengali. According to Shakti da’s wish, all the actors in Anusandhan (1981) dubbed the dialogues in Bengali in their own voices and I would help them with learning the language. The Hindi version of Anusandhan was later released as Barsaat Ki Ek Raat. Is it true that despite staying focused on establishing himself in the Bombay film industry, Shakti Samanta always wanted to represent his connections with Bengal through a bigger platform? He was always fascinated with Bengali literature and therefore, he made a lot of films on Bengali stories. For example, Anurodh (1997) and Ayaash (1982) were the Hindi adaptations of novels Deya Neya and Stri by Saratchandra Chattopadhyay; and Amar Prem (1971) was based on another celebrated Bengali author Bibhutibhushan Bandopadhyay’s novel, Nishipadma. Shakti da would always tell us that the audience should be able to relate to the storyline of a film and feel a part of it. To him, Bengali stories had the ability to strike the chords in the audience’s hearts. Also most of his crew consisted of Bengali talent.... Exactly so! His brother Girija Samanta was both the production manager and producer of Shakti Films. Apart from me, Ranjan Bose, Sachin Bhowmick and Shailajananda Mukherjee were heavily relied upon by Shakti da for scripts. Art director Shanti Das and cinematographer Alok Dasgupta were Shakti da’s consistent team members throughout his career. He had an intimate friendship with the Bengali father-son duo of music directors Sachin Dev Burman and Rahul Dev Barman who lent distinctive dimensions in Shakti da’s films, making them more appealing to the audience with content specific music and haunting melodies. Also, he would often look forward to casting Bengali actors in supporting roles. Is it true that Shakti Samanta decided to make Amanush after the box office failure of Chhoti Si Mulaqat (1967) in order to assure the position and fame of Uttam Kumar [he produced Chhoti Si Mulaqat] in the Bombay film industry? Shakti da had immense respect for Uttam Kumar and he had always wanted to make a film with him. It is true that after the failure of Chhoti Si Mulaqat, he got the right opportunity to turn his dream into reality. Uttam Kumar would almost be devastated after the loss; however, Shakti da chose to stand by him and with Amanush Uttam Kumar’s true worth was ensured in the Bombay film industry. He also introduced many other Bengali actors came to the Bombay film industry and made them famous... Yes. He definitely introduced Sharmila Tagore and Moushumi Chatterjee to the Bombay film industry. Though Sharmila Tagore had already worked with the legendary film director Satyajit Ray, she would admit it publicly that she got the training to act in commercial films from Shakti da. Sharmila Tagore’s debut appearance in Samanta’s Kashmir Ki Kali (1964) and the success of An Evening in Paris (1967), Amar Prem (1972), Aradhana (1969), Amanush (1975), Anand Ashram (1977) turned her into one of the leading actresses of the 1970s and 1980s. Can you share a few fond memories with your mentor? There are many interesting stories on my association with Shakti da but I would like to share two of them that essentially reflect the strong points of his characteristics as a filmmaker. Shakti da was very brave in his decisions and never wanted to compromise. During the shooting of Amanush (1975), despite being repeatedly warned of the danger in the Sunderbans, he built an entire resort there for the cast and crew. Another story refers to the time when he was admitted in the Lilavati Hospital [in Mumbai] after he suffered a heart attack. When I had gone to visit him, he would point out to me the number of pipes linked to the instruments in the cabin and would ask me to closely observe those so that I can remember and later apply the knowledge in my work. This impeccable power of observation made Shakti da achieve the success in crafting his characters, as well as ensure the realistic depiction of the stories in his films. Whatever I have achieved today is because of all the lessons I learnt from Shakti Da. Without his close association I do not think that I could have earned my name in film direction.
