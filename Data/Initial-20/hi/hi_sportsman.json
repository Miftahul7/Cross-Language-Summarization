व्यापक रूप से खेल के इतिहास में सबसे महान गेंदबाजों में से एक माना जाता है। 1992 में शेन वॉर्न ने अपना पहला टेस्ट मैच खेला था और श्रीलंका के मुथैया मुरलीधरन के बाद वह दूसरे गेंदबाज बने थे जिन्होंने 1000 अंतरराष्ट्रीय विकेट (टेस्ट और वनडे मैचों में) लिये। वॉर्न के 708 विकेट टेस्ट क्रिकेट में किसी भी गेंदबाज द्वारा लिये गए सर्वाधिक विकेट थे, जब तक कि मुरलीधरन ने इससे ज्यादा विकेट नहीं ले लिये थे। वॉर्न उपयोगी निचले क्रम के बल्लेबाज भी थे। वह एकमात्र खिलाड़ी है जिन्होंने 3000+ टेस्ट रन बनाए लेकिन कभी शतक नहीं जड़ा। उनका करियर मैदान के बाहर विवादों से ग्रस्त रहा। इन में प्रतिबंधित पदार्थ के लिए सकारात्मक परीक्षण पाए जाने पर क्रिकेट से प्रतिबंध शामिल था। साथ ही सट्टेबाजों से पैसा स्वीकार करके खेल को बदनामी में लाने का आरोप और भी कई विवाद। वह जनवरी 2007 में ऑस्ट्रेलिया की इंग्लैंड पर 5-0 की द एशेज की जीत के अंत में अंतर्राष्ट्रीय क्रिकेट से सेवानिवृत्त हुए। उस समय ऑस्ट्रेलियाई टीम के अभिन्न अंग में से तीन अन्य खिलाड़ी भी रिटायर हुए- ग्लेन मैकग्रा, डेमियन मार्टिन और जस्टिन लैंगर। अंतरराष्ट्रीय क्रिकेट से अपनी सेवानिवृत्ति के बाद वॉर्न ने हैम्पशायर काउंटी क्रिकेट क्लब के लिये प्रथम श्रेणी क्रिकेट खेला। 2008 में आईपीएल की टीम राजस्थान रॉयल्स के कोच और कप्तान की भूमिका निभाई और टीम को जीत दिलाई। कुल मिलाकर उन्होंने 1992 से 2007 तक 145 टेस्ट मैच खेलें थे जिसमें उन्होंने 25.41 की गेंदबाज़ी औसत से 708 विकेट लिये। 1993 से 2005 तक उन्होंने 194 एक दिवसीय अंतर्राष्ट्रीय में 293 विकेट लिये। 1999 क्रिकेट विश्व कप की विजेता टीम में उनका अहम योगदान था।", "references": ["नयी दिल्‍ली : ऑस्‍ट्रेलिया के पूर्व दिग्‍गज स्पिनर और दुनिया के लगभग सभी बल्‍लेबाजों में खौफ पैदा करने वाले

We can't expect them to suddenly stop believing and switch offRohit Brijnath03-Oct-2008 Once more into the breach, for old time's sake © AFP Young men in sport are always rightly granted a leniency that older men are not. So this autumn, at the first uncertain innings by India's cricketing aged, at the first legspin spell with no reward, one word will surreptitiously creep into every conversation. Retirement.These men, whose names stay in the memory just behind family, are clearly older as athletes, their skills fading gently like the evening light, but the question always is: how much of The Gift remains? The faithful will say, look at thousands of runs, hundreds of wickets, behind them. The critics will say: precisely, greatness is behind them. Should they go, stay, wait, make a deal? There is no perfect end anyway to a sporting life. Maybe only Pete Sampras got close on that evening at the 2002 US Open when he shouted savagely into the noise of victory, \"I f***ing did it.\"Every day pragmatism and sentimentality collide in India's cricketing universe. Once, I incorrectly thought Sachin Tendulkar should retire, then I changed my mind, now I just watch. Goodbye is awfully hard, for them and us, but it is getting closer.We met the Great One in 1989, when he introduced himself to us with high notes hit by bat and vocal chord. Tendulkar may have two children, but for my generation he is always favourite son. Then the rest came. In 1990, The Precise One, a scholarly warrior who unveiled his spinning craft with devotion; in 1992, The Defiant One, a steely, stylish man of amusing, aristocratic belligerence; in 1996, The Intense One, cricket's student who batted like a monk upholding a vow of discipline; and finally The Elegant One, who was a Japanese haiku master in a previous life.They were, and are, our champions, our companions, our obsessions, our sporting best days and our very worst, a part of the calendar of our lives. Remembering the last time I went home to Kolkata requires no thought: it's when VVS Laxman wrote his finest concerto. Whenever life seemed to get away from us, when the water dried in the tap on a hot day, and bosses stank, there was always them. When Tendulkar stood on tiptoe to drive, as if God had him by the collar, or Sourav Ganguly hit an off-side drive with such style he might well have been wearing a tuxedo, life somehow got better.But if these men once exuded a certainty, now it is less so. Confidence comes, then it dries. Tendulkar has no control over his body's misbehaviour, Rahul Dravid no idea why technique abandoned him for a while without even a farewell note, Ganguly no certain explanation why timing briefly eluded him. Mind and body are in a slow divorce. These men have fought and defeated everything: selectors, derision, pitches, Australians, but age is beyond beating. Of course there are five-wicket hauls left in them, and strong centuries, and even great series, but they will arrive at a slower frequency. So why not go, leave to an applauding nation; why sit, in cricketing middle age, alone at home, as Ganguly must have, waiting for a phone call? He was reprieved, but still it's intriguing how many heroes become tragedies. Competition is an addiction that keeps them here, that brings them back, an addiction so deep that even the perfect ending is somehow imperfect. In a way, this makes sense: how can finishing what you love most ever be satisfactory? But in sport the fairytale ending is mostly an illusion. Mostly men just fade from the memory. Or exit a shambles. Or go to a sigh of relief as Kapil Dev did. From our safe distance in jobs where we can work till we're 60, where no public calls for us to go, it is wondered: why do they still play, what for, what's left, aren't there enough runs and rupees? It is, in fact, an ignorant question: they play because they love it, because they ache for competition, because they don't do anything else as well, because they can still play, as Laxman might tell you. They achieved greatness because they believed in themselves, because they didn't give up, because they were problem solvers, it's inscribed in their DNA; so perhaps we can't expect them now to suddenly stop believing, give up, run from the problem.There is more. Men in their 60s often struggle with retirement, their lives suddenly without adequate purpose, minds still active but not constantly activated. In the morning there is nowhere to go, and it can be debilitating. So what of men in their 30s, so young yet reminded constantly of their use-by dates, men who have known only cricket and are unsure what life holds for them. In trousers not coloured white, Tendulkar is mortal. So, of course, they play on.When Marilyn Monroe returned from entertaining the troops in Korea, she told her husband, the New York Yankees star, Joe DiMaggio, \"Joe, you never heard such cheering.\" Dryly he replied: \"Yes I have.\" This life athletes lead, this ability to bend a nation in praise of you with a few strokes of the bat, is an intoxication without parallel (which is why sex is constantly used as a comparison in sport). It is a tremendous power, accompanied by the knowledge that nothing will compare to this in their lives, everything else will be second best. To play on is to know that high is still possible.Competition is an addiction that keeps them here, that brings them back, an addiction so deep that even the perfect ending is somehow imperfect. In a way, this makes sense: how can finishing what you love most ever be satisfactory? Michael Jordan faked an opponent to the floor, elevated, sank a jumper that won the Bulls and him a sixth NBA championship. We swooned, he retired. Then, inexplicably to the rational mind, which saw a neatness to his exit, he returned; which makes you wonder whether this \"go-out-on-top\" business is more an obsession with us, the unathletic. Indeed, a cricketer says, \"If I get dropped, so be it, it's part of sport,\" and perhaps some part of them wants someone else to make the call, not them. Tendulkar and Ganguly: men in their 30s; young but reminded constantly of their use-by dates © AFP Ego drove Jordan, as it does all of them. Athletes arrive at greatness by believing, then proving, they are better than the rest. Muhammad Ali just had the chutzpah to say aloud what his kind think: I am the greatest. At his hearing over the incident at the Belgian Grand Prix, Lewis Hamilton would haughtily say to his interrogator: \"I know pretty much every single manoeuvre in the book and that's why I'm the best at my job.\" For such men to admit they're not good enough, that other men (in the cricketers' case, younger men) are better, is indigestible. When they go, eventually, they'll gallantly say, \"It's time to make way for younger men,\" but they're not really in the giving-way-to-anyone business. They've built their lives by leaping and scrambling over others.And so these men play. They still seem to love the field; it is the getting ready for the field that must be exhausting: the travelling, the unpacking, the practice, the hotel-room walls, the family left behind (which is what eventually might make them fold). They were good enough to be the best in India; now they must remain good enough to play for India. They have changed. They might compromise, gently and subconsciously: where once 80 was a minimum, now they might settle for 20 fewer. This deal is somewhat understandable. What is not is the appalling suggestion that they will be \"accommodated\" in the team as long as they agree to retire soon, so as to be given a fitting send-off. It puts individual before team, and these men surely will not stand for it.They are exceptional, these five, great players and good men, and this is not easily found in sport. I was, for a long while, just another Indian journalist to their cricketer (now I live elsewhere), and found them articulate, well-mannered, interesting, generous, devoted (to team), mainly devoid of arrogance. Yes, they were imperfect too. There is a reluctance now among sportspeople to play the role model, as if it is some unreasonable, excessive burden, but these men wore that responsibility with a fine dignity at most times. India is lucky to have had them.I am less enamoured of world cricket these days. It is a noisy game, full of boastful official chatter, where manners on the field have become disposable, and Twenty20 threatens to derail everything else. The best love affairs, anyway, come in our youth, and these men I grew up with. Always I watched them. Now especially, even though occasionally it is painful to see them lurch and stagger, feet mixed up and bat late. But I have to watch. Because they're Great, Precise, Defiant, Intense, Elegant. Because soon enough, a few months, a year, whether they walk away or must be pushed, there will be an Indian team without the names Tendulkar, Ganguly, Dravid, Laxman, Kumble. Imagine that?

They still seem to love the field; it is the getting ready for the field that must be exhausting: the travelling, the unpacking, the practice, the hotel-room walls, the family left behind (which is what eventually might make them fold). They were good enough to be the best in India; now they must remain good enough to play for India. They have changed. They might compromise, gently and subconsciously: where once 80 was a minimum, now they might settle for 20 fewer. This deal is somewhat understandable. What is not is the appalling suggestion that they will be \"accommodated\" in the team as long as they agree to retire soon, so as to be given a fitting send-off. It puts individual before team, and these men surely will not stand for it. They are exceptional, these five, great players and good men, and this is not easily found in sport. I was, for a long while, just another Indian journalist to their cricketer (now I live elsewhere), and found them articulate, well-mannered, interesting, generous, devoted (to team), mainly devoid of arrogance. Yes, they were imperfect too. There is a reluctance now among sportspeople to play the role model, as if it is some unreasonable, excessive burden, but these men wore that responsibility with a fine dignity at most times. India is lucky to have had them. I am less enamoured of world cricket these days. It is a noisy game, full of boastful official chatter, where manners on the field have become disposable, and Twenty20 threatens to derail everything else. The best love affairs, anyway, come in our youth, and these men I grew up with. Always I watched them. Now especially, even though occasionally it is painful to see them lurch and stagger, feet mixed up and bat late. But I have to watch. Because they're Great, Precise, Defiant, Intense, Elegant. Because soon enough, a few months, a year, whether they walk away or must be pushed, there will be an Indian team without the names Tendulkar, Ganguly, Dravid, Laxman, Kumble. Imagine that? I'd rather not.

We can't expect them to suddenly stop believing and switch off Rohit Brijnath October 3, 2008 Once more into the breach, for old time's sake © AFP Young men in sport are always rightly granted a leniency that older men are not. So this autumn, at the first uncertain innings by India's cricketing aged, at the first legspin spell with no reward, one word will surreptitiously creep into every conversation. Retirement. These men, whose names stay in the memory just behind family, are clearly older as athletes, their skills fading gently like the evening light, but the question always is: how much of The Gift remains? The faithful will say, look at thousands of runs, hundreds of wickets, behind them. The critics will say: precisely, greatness is behind them. Should they go, stay, wait, make a deal? There is no perfect end anyway to a sporting life. Maybe only Pete Sampras got close on that evening at the 2002 US Open when he shouted savagely into the noise of victory, \"I f***ing did it.\" Every day pragmatism and sentimentality collide in India's cricketing universe. Once, I incorrectly thought Sachin Tendulkar should retire, then I changed my mind, now I just watch. Goodbye is awfully hard, for them and us, but it is getting closer. We met the Great One in 1989, when he introduced himself to us with high notes hit by bat and vocal chord. Tendulkar may have two children, but for my generation he is always favourite son. Then the rest came. In 1990, The Precise One, a scholarly warrior who unveiled his spinning craft with devotion; in 1992, The Defiant One, a steely, stylish man of amusing, aristocratic belligerence; in 1996, The Intense One, cricket's student who batted like a monk upholding a vow of discipline; and finally The Elegant One, who was a Japanese haiku master in a previous life. They were, and are, our champions, our companions, our obsessions, our sporting best days and our very worst, a part of the calendar of our lives. Remembering the last time I went home to Kolkata requires no thought: it's when VVS Laxman wrote his finest concerto. Whenever life seemed to get away from us, when the water dried in the tap on a hot day, and bosses stank, there was always them. When Tendulkar stood on tiptoe to drive, as if God had him by the collar, or Sourav Ganguly hit an off-side drive with such style he might well have been wearing a tuxedo, life somehow got better. But if these men once exuded a certainty, now it is less so. Confidence comes, then it dries. Tendulkar has no control over his body's misbehaviour, Rahul Dravid no idea why technique abandoned him for a while without even a farewell note, Ganguly no certain explanation why timing briefly eluded him. Mind and body are in a slow divorce. These men have fought and defeated everything: selectors, derision, pitches, Australians, but age is beyond beating. Of course there are five-wicket hauls left in them, and strong centuries, and even great series, but they will arrive at a slower frequency. So why not go, leave to an applauding nation; why sit, in cricketing middle age, alone at home, as Ganguly must have, waiting for a phone call? He was reprieved, but still it's intriguing how many heroes become tragedies. Competition is an addiction that keeps them here, that brings them back, an addiction so deep that even the perfect ending is somehow imperfect. In a way, this makes sense: how can finishing what you love most ever be satisfactory? But in sport the fairytale ending is mostly an illusion. Mostly men just fade from the memory. Or exit a shambles. Or go to a sigh of relief as Kapil Dev did. From our safe distance in jobs where we can work till we're 60, where no public calls for us to go, it is wondered: why do they still play, what for, what's left, aren't there enough runs and rupees? It is, in fact, an ignorant question: they play because they love it, because they ache for competition, because they don't do anything else as well, because they can still play, as Laxman might tell you. They achieved greatness because they believed in themselves, because they didn't give up, because they were problem solvers, it's inscribed in their DNA; so perhaps we can't expect them now to suddenly stop believing, give up, run from the problem. There is more. Men in their 60s often struggle with retirement, their lives suddenly without adequate purpose, minds still active but not constantly activated. In the morning there is nowhere to go, and it can be debilitating. So what of men in their 30s, so young yet reminded constantly of their use-by dates, men who have known only cricket and are unsure what life holds for them. In trousers not coloured white, Tendulkar is mortal. So, of course, they play on. When Marilyn Monroe returned from entertaining the troops in Korea, she told her husband, the New York Yankees star, Joe DiMaggio, \"Joe, you never heard such cheering.\" Dryly he replied: \"Yes I have.\" This life athletes lead, this ability to bend a nation in praise of you with a few strokes of the bat, is an intoxication without parallel (which is why sex is constantly used as a comparison in sport). It is a tremendous power, accompanied by the knowledge that nothing will compare to this in their lives, everything else will be second best. To play on is to know that high is still possible. Competition is an addiction that keeps them here, that brings them back, an addiction so deep that even the perfect ending is somehow imperfect. In a way, this makes sense: how can finishing what you love most ever be satisfactory? Michael Jordan faked an opponent to the floor, elevated, sank a jumper that won the Bulls and him a sixth NBA championship. We swooned, he retired. Then, inexplicably to the rational mind, which saw a neatness to his exit, he returned; which makes you wonder whether this \"go-out-on-top\" business is more an obsession with us, the unathletic. Indeed, a cricketer says, \"If I get dropped, so be it, it's part of sport,\" and perhaps some part of them wants someone else to make the call, not them. Tendulkar and Ganguly: men in their 30s; young but reminded constantly of their use-by dates © AFP Ego drove Jordan, as it does all of them. Athletes arrive at greatness by believing, then proving, they are better than the rest. Muhammad Ali just had the chutzpah to say aloud what his kind think: I am the greatest. At his hearing over the incident at the Belgian Grand Prix, Lewis Hamilton would haughtily say to his interrogator: \"I know pretty much every single manoeuvre in the book and that's why I'm the best at my job.\" For such men to admit they're not good enough, that other men (in the cricketers' case, younger men) are better, is indigestible. When they go, eventually, they'll gallantly say, \"It's time to make way for younger men,\" but they're not really in the giving-way-to-anyone business. They've built their lives by leaping and scrambling over others. And so these men play. They still seem to love the field; it is the getting ready for the field that must be exhausting: the travelling, the unpacking, the practice, the hotel-room walls, the family left behind (which is what eventually might make them fold).

And certainly its a pain to end what one loves the most and has lived in and with it. Its a trend with top sports celebrities, to end the day when in top contention to make way for fresh talent and push the teams and the nations' success to the helm. With technological advancements and constant match and player reviews of the strengths and weaknesses, it becomes a challenge for these demi gods live up to the dreams of winning every championship played and also prove their fitness. It would be hard for me to see a team without the famous 5. I just wish that like my favorite hero Kapil Dev, these gentlemen of Cricket do end the their day in the gentleman's game in a good fashion and continue to love what they have been associated with in the likes of Javagal Srinath, Venkatraghavan, Venkatesh Prasad and all those heroes who ruled during times. Posted by kapokkid on October 05 2008, 10:24 AM GMT Change in many ways is inevitable and cricket is not going to be any different. T20 is a product of its times sitting comfortably and fashionably alongside fast food joints, celeb-pop culture, reality shows and page 3 tabloids. I grew up watching these men light up cricket not just with their cricketing abilities but also with the character that they brought to the game. These men made cricket what it was for me. I am now 27 and I consider myself fortunate to have witnessed one of the great ages for Indian Test cricket. The pragmatist inside me tells me that they should make way for the younger generation. However, the pragmatist inside me also told me that I shouldn't be missing classes to follow Test cricket. They have, as a few have pointed out, not been as successful as compared to an Australian team. I for one however would not have liked it any other way. The manner in which they played the game is much more important and they didn't disappoint in that regard !! Posted by curryrice81 on October 05 2008, 03:23 AM GMT I remember reading 'Sportsworld' in the early 90s as an cricket maniac kid and mr.Brijnath elated me many times with his wonderful pieces. He's done it again now. Kudos to you, Sir. There was another thing I did in the 90s - I invested heavily in these stalwarts. I gave them a lot of my time, my thoughts and of course plenty of my emotions. Today in 2008 as a 27 year old, I am left disappointed by these gentlemen. They were artists and troopers as cricketers, they fought hard when the chips were down - but they never really delivered as a team. They did not give us a world cup - not in 92, not in 96, not in 99, not in 2003 and certainly not in 2007. Time and time again I (and millions others) would hope and struggle to keep the television on even after SR Tendulkar had departed but they would collapse like a heap of cards more often than not. I've invested too much and the 'market' has not really paid off. Posted by sundarrao on October 05 2008, 02:08 AM GMT Rohit...This one isn't about the article itself. EVERYBODY here have loved it and its content...and totally unique style which tells us it's Rohit-our-man. WHAT in the world are you doing writing about criceffingket? You're such a gifted chap and that's been obvious ever since we chaps of Calcutta (76-79 B.Com Xavier's Cal) read you in India Today..which was eons ago. Time to tell us about the \"creative freedom\" in S'pore. Or about the \"Speaker's Corner\" horse manure they have in that city. Any chance they'll raid you at 12 midnight because that bounder for a Senior-Mentor-Minister has read this? And something about the burning of churches in Orissa, now, and then in Gujarat. Pls to do it soonest. This cricket thing is upto there in the gills. Rohit you fab-man. Let's now try the patriotic one: Your country NEEDS you. mailpsr@yahoo.com Will reveal our ITC brotherhood at that stage. Bye, and hoping you convert. Sundar Rao, now at Hyderabad Posted by pratapa on October 04 2008, 19:01 PM GMT Amazing article!!Thank you for providing us with a peek into how the mind of a Great Cricketer works. The fact that its not for the money that these great men play the game, but its for who they are.. they are born cricketers and cricket is embedded in their DNA. Someday, they will eventually have to leave the game, either on their own terms or on someone else's. Until that moment, I will enjoy every moment of their game, be it for one more series or for one more world cup. Their legacy will remain forever in the game! Thanks again, Rohit. Posted by balaji_05 on October 04 2008, 16:05 PM GMT K excuse me, but who's the defiant one of 1992? I read the article (which i think is brilliant by the way) and I've been pulling out my hair ever since. So sorry, but I'm 17 and have no idea who that is! I've tried researching, and the only famous one was Shane Warne! Not an Indian! Somebody help me! Posted by naveendada on October 04 2008, 10:56 AM GMT Hello Mr.Brijnath Thanks for such a beautiful article. It is the best i have ever read. You have expressed all our feelings and the emotions attached with these great FIVE. This team will not be same once these guys move out. Its a bit dissappointing that people have got very short memory. Now a days if any youngster plays well in a match they expect that he is the new king of the team and they start cheering for them forgetting the past that how our national team would have been if these guys were not in the team. The important all of us need to learn is respect these cricketing legends. One thing i don't agree with you is there will be no commpromise formula once they feel they are not treated the way they need to they themselves will move out of the team. ONCE AGAIN GREAT PIECE OF ARTICLE. YOU TOUCHED ALL OF US. Posted by Nata on October 04 2008, 08:35 AM GMT This is one of the best articles ever read. Excellent one sir! Posted by sonalsingh81 on October 04 2008, 07:07 AM GMT Thank you, Mr. Brijnath - you have said so beautifully what many of us mean to say when we maintain that at least some of the senior players deserve to stay on. Anyone who appreciates your piece will understand just why we are so keen on having them stay on, at least for some more time - they represent a time and world when cricket was still cricket, and so different from the way things now are Posted by krik8crazy on October 04 2008, 02:45 AM GMT Every great player has his time. But once time passes, greatness leaves them too. Michael Jordan came back a second time and didn't even make the play offs. Mohammed Ali got badly beat up as he tried to make yet another come back to the ring. Roger Federer looked like an impostor all year until he redeemed himself at the US open this year. No matter how great a player is, they need to time their exit well otherwise humiliation is inevitable. Not by selectors, but on the playing field itself.

His captain then is now the Chairman of the national selection committee -- Krish Srikkanth spoke to Nishant Arora on his memories of the master. Krish Srikkanth: I think I am very lucky because God made me his first captain when he made his debut. It is an awesome feeling now when you see that same Sachin Tendulkar scoring highest number of runs in Test cricket. And you are the Chairman of selectors, and I can't tell you it is such a proud feeling. I can't really explain the feeling I can only experience it. He has played for 19 long years and he has still got that passion which is what amazes me. He is mentally and physically tired and still when he goes out to play he plays like the same way as when he made his debut in 1989 - running around, talking to people, doing something and one great quality in him is the fact that he has always been a team man. CNN-IBN: How is the dressing room feeling about it? How are the teammates reacting to it? Krish Srikkanth: It is an awesome feeling, as I said. But the most important point is he has got One-Day record, he has got Test record, he has got all the records in the world -- number of centuries, number of fifties. And don't forget that he is going to continue playing and I have always believed that he should continue playing for at least minimum of 2-3 years because we are going through a transition phase and this is the time when you need guys like Sachin Tendulkar to guide all the youngsters. CNN-IBN: Tell us something about your first impression about him like facing Wasim Akram, Waqar Younis, Imran Khan etc -- all the legends of the game? It was a great Pakistani bowling attack. Krish Srikkanth: He never showed any signs of nervousness, even if he was feeling nervousness inside but he never showed it outside, which is a great sign. When you are playing bowlers of such reputation and you don't show a sign of nervousness - in fact, he played pretty well, he played very confidently and that is what it is more important. CNN-IBN: Could you make out that this guy would go down in the history as one of the greatest batsmen? Krish Srikkanth: In fact, I told him straight away that day that -- 'My dear friend, one day you are going to make it big but don't ever forget that I am your first captain. And by the way, I keep reminding him about it even today. Total Comments: 0 Read All Comments | Post Comment search byPlayerYearOfficialGround Copyright © 2008, Web18 Software Services Ltd.

India has had the edge on this changing Australian team for a while now and things may stay that way for some time, though there is no doubt the Australians will be stung by the humiliating loss in the second Test and will come out determined to make amends in Delhi. India has an ageing batting line-up, but plenty in reserve to continue its push to the top. Sourav Ganguly has done well to claw his way back into the team after a bitter falling out under the Greg Chappell regime. Ganguly may not be popular in Australia, but he is treated like a prince in India, loved and respected by the masses. He has announced that this is his last series and I wouldn't be surprised if V. V. S Laxman is heading down the same path. Rahul Dravid and the master, Sachin Tendulkar, are rapidly approaching the end as well. India must stagger their departures to avoid a mass exodus. The frightening thing for world cricket is that India has some super talent - with both bat and ball - waiting in the wings. Make no mistake, the Board of Control for Cricket in India is the most powerful body in world cricket and its introduction of the hugely successful Indian Premier League earlier this year was a masterstroke. Not only was it a monumental financial windfall but, even more importantly, it exposed and unearthed young talent, albeit in the Twenty20 version of the game. The traditionalists will argue that this \"Mickey Mouse\" game is detrimental to developing batting technique and crucifies bowlers. This is narrow-minded thinking and totally incorrect. The best players will adjust their games, something that was clearly evident throughout the IPL tournament. In terms of batsmen, watch out for some of the following in the not too-distant future- Suresh Raina, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Yusuf Pathan and Shikhar Dhawan. Raina and Sharma can really play and it wouldn't surprise if one or two appeared before this Test series is finished, especially if India can secure the Border-Gavaskar trophy in Delhi. India's bowling stocks are also impressive - Zaheer Khan swings it prodigiously and Ishant Sharma is tall, fast, bouncy and can move it off the pitch - and there is more of the same in the background waiting for a chance. Munaf Patel, 25, has already had a taste at the top and will be better next time around. Tall and strong, with the ability to move the ball both in the air and off the wicket, he is reminiscent of Paul Reiffel - unassuming and underrated but a mighty fine bowler. Shanthakumaran Sreesanth is another, a genuine swinger of the ball, and along with R. P. Singh, the back-up quicks are top quality. Also pencil in Pradeep Sangwan as one to watch. He's a young left-armer fresh out of the under-19s who was impressive at times during the IPL. Anil Kumble has been a champion but his time is also coming to an end. Amit Mishra was superb on debut in Mohali and now the Indian selectors have a tough call to make on two fronts. Kumble the spinner and Kumble the captain. Don't be surprised if Delhi is a dust bowl and India plays all three spinners. Laxman would lose his spot moving M. S. Dhoni up to No. 6 in the batting order. Mishra will take plenty of Test wickets. They also have another little beauty by the name of Piyush Chawla, another leggie with magic in his fingers. Harbhajan Singh is a quality off-spinner with plenty of time left in the game. Matthew Hayden recently referred to him as an obnoxious little weed, but the Aussies need more than the Zero wand to wipe him out. Dhoni is the new prince in India. He is massive. He should inherit the captaincy sooner rather than later. His tactical nous is very good, his ability unquestioned. It is time to stop the revolving door of Indian captains and let Dhoni settle in for the long haul. His glovework is inconsistent - sometimes brilliant, other times awful as we have witnessed during this series. However, he can really bat and, just like Adam Gilchrist, can change the complexion of a game in the space of a few overs. Indian cricket has long craved to be the best in the world and at various times it has seriously threatened. It has a habit of being derailed mainly due to instability and political unrest in and around the team. It appears it may finally be on the brink of a golden era.

The traditionalists will argue that this \"Mickey Mouse\" game is detrimental to developing batting technique and crucifies bowlers. This is narrow-minded thinking and totally incorrect. The best players will adjust their games, something that was clearly evident throughout the IPL tournament. In terms of batsmen, watch out for some of the following in the not too-distant future- Suresh Raina, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Yusuf Pathan and Shikhar Dhawan. Raina and Sharma can really play and it wouldn't surprise if one or two appeared before this Test series is finished, especially if India can secure the Border-Gavaskar trophy in Delhi. India's bowling stocks are also impressive - Zaheer Khan swings it prodigiously and Ishant Sharma is tall, fast, bouncy and can move it off the pitch - and there is more of the same in the background waiting for a chance. Munaf Patel, 25, has already had a taste at the top and will be better next time around. Tall and strong, with the ability to move the ball both in the air and off the wicket, he is reminiscent of Paul Reiffel - unassuming and underrated but a mighty fine bowler. Shanthakumaran Sreesanth is another, a genuine swinger of the ball, and along with R. P. Singh, the back-up quicks are top quality. Also pencil in Pradeep Sangwan as one to watch. He's a young left-armer fresh out of the under-19s who was impressive at times during the IPL. Anil Kumble has been a champion but his time is also coming to an end. Amit Mishra was superb on debut in Mohali and now the Indian selectors have a tough call to make on two fronts. Kumble the spinner and Kumble the captain. Don't be surprised if Delhi is a dust bowl and India plays all three spinners. Laxman would lose his spot moving M. S. Dhoni up to No. 6 in the batting order. Mishra will take plenty of Test wickets. They also have another little beauty by the name of Piyush Chawla, another leggie with magic in his fingers. Harbhajan Singh is a quality off-spinner with plenty of time left in the game. Matthew Hayden recently referred to him as an obnoxious little weed, but the Aussies need more than the Zero wand to wipe him out. Dhoni is the new prince in India. He is massive. He should inherit the captaincy sooner rather than later. His tactical nous is very good, his ability unquestioned. It is time to stop the revolving door of Indian captains and let Dhoni settle in for the long haul. His glovework is inconsistent - sometimes brilliant, other times awful as we have witnessed during this series. However, he can really bat and, just like Adam Gilchrist, can change the complexion of a game in the space of a few overs. Indian cricket has long craved to be the best in the world and at various times it has seriously threatened. It has a habit of being derailed mainly due to instability and political unrest in and around the team. It appears it may finally be on the brink of a golden era.

Kohli had a stunning game, but his runs only served to highlight the chasm between him and the rest of India's batsmen. It wasn't the first time he had played the lone hand in an overseas Test either: the story was similar on the tour to South Africa earlier this year. In fact, the narrative looks remarkably like the 1990s, when Sachin Tendulkar used to be the one prolific and consistent batsman in series outside Asia.ESPNcricinfo LtdIn the 10-year period between November 1991 and December 2001, Tendulkar played 23 Tests in Australia, England, New Zealand and South Africa, and his numbers in those matches are very similar to Kohli's stats in the 17 Tests he has played in these countries since the start of the South Africa tour in December 2013.Kohli has the slightly better average, but there is little to choose between their conversion rates, or the manner in which both dominated their batting line-ups, scoring a fifth of their team's runs off the bat. (In terms of results, Kohli's India has done better with a 2-10 win-loss record in these 17 games, compared to 0-13 during Tendulkar's 23 Tests.)ESPNcricinfo LtdLooking at the numbers series-wise, what stands out for Tendulkar is his consistency: in each of the seven series he played in these countries (excluding the one-off Test in New Zealand in 1994), he scored at least one century. Kohli, on the other hand, has been outstanding in each of these series except one, but that one failure was glaring, in England in 2014, when his contribution dropped to less than 6% of India's bat runs. Exclude that series, and Kohli's contribution to India's runs goes up from 20.2% to 25.45%, which means Kohli has scored a quarter of India's bat runs in the remaining 12 Tests.ESPNcricinfo LtdIn both eras, what has stood out is the gulf between the lead batsman and the rest. While Kohli has averaged 54.48 in these 17 Tests, the rest of India's top seven batsmen (Nos. 1-7) have averaged 28.13, which means Kohli's average is 1.94 times that of the other Indian top order. In fact, Kohli has scored as many hundreds as the rest of the batsmen put together. For Tendulkar, the difference is marginally higher at 1.98, because the rest of the batsmen averaged only 26.48.ESPNcricinfo LtdLooking at the individual batsmen list in each period, what stands out is the number of batsmen who struggled to perform in these conditions. During the Tendulkar decade, while Rahul Dravid, Sourav Ganguly and VVS Laxman averaged more than 40, there were a host of others - including Mohammad Azharuddin (25.24), Sanjay Manjrekar (23.94), Navjot Sidhu (23.45), and Dilip Vengsarkar (17.55) - who averaged less than 26.ESPNcricinfo LtdSimilarly, in the Kohli era, Cheteshwar Pujara, Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma and KL Rahul have all clearly been underwhelming, while Murali Vijay's recent stats are extremely disappointing too. In fact, Bhuvneshwar Kumar has a higher average (30.61) than Pujara, Dhawan, Rohit and Rahul, which suggests India missed more than just his bowling at Edgbaston.ESPNcricinfo LtdIndia's over-reliance on Tendulkar reduced significantly from the start of 2002, when Dravid became a champion in overseas conditions, and Laxman, Ganguly, Gautam Gambhir and Virender Sehwag all came up with useful contributions in at least one series. Starting in 2002, Tendulkar played 34 more Tests in these four countries, and while he still averaged more than anyone else in these Tests - 51.42, which was marginally higher than Dravid's 50.50, and very close to his own 52.39 in the 1990s - in percentage terms, his contribution to India's bat runs dropped to 16.67%.ESPNcricinfo LtdThe ideal situation for India over the next few years would be if Kohli's percentage contribution drops similarly, despite him being nearly as prolific as he is now.

They are the only batsmen to reach this landmark with centuries. With Kohli smashing Tendulkar's record of fastest to 10,000 ODI runs in terms of innings, it is a good time to compare Kohli's current stats with Tendulkar's, at the time the latter reached the landmark.The overall numbersWhen looking at the stats in isolation, there's little doubt that Kohli bosses the numbers. In terms of innings to reach the 10,000-run mark, he is 21% better than Tendulkar; in terms of average and innings per century, he is 40% better; his strike rate advantage is relatively lower at 7%.ESPNcricinfo LtdBased on these numbers, there is no doubt who wins the contest, but some of those comparisons are a bit unfair to Tendulkar. It's clear that ODIs are far more high-scoring now than they were when Tendulkar scored his first 10,000 runs; any comparison of numbers, especially strike rates, needs to take that into account.In the 266 matches that Tendulkar played to reach the 10,000-run landmark, the average strike rate by other batsmen was 71.51; in Kohli's era it is 85.99. The average for other batsmen during Tendulkar's first 266 matches was 27.90; for Kohli it is 31.73. Taking that into account, it is clear that Tendulkar exceeds the average strike rate of his era by a much higher margin than Kohli, though Kohli remains better in terms of the ratio of averages. Tendulkar also won more Man-of-the-Match awards, but that is, to some extent, also a factor of the quality of his team-mates during that period.Kohli v TendulkarAttribute Virat Kohli Tendulkar (till 10k) Tendulkar (Mar '94-2001)** Inns 205 259 193 Ave 59.62 42.63 46.37 Ave factor^ 1.88 1.53 1.61 SR 92.51 86.52 89.61 SR factor* 1.08 1.21 1.22 Inns/100 5.54 9.25 6.89 ^ Ratio of batsman's ave to ave of all other batsmen in those matches* Ratio of batsman's SR to SR of all other batsmen in those matches** Since Tendulkar first opened, till he reached 10kThen, there is also the first 66 innings of Tendulkar's career, when he played in the middle order and wasn't the force he became when he started opening the batting. Exclude those matches, and his average in 193 innings after he started opening the batting (till March 31, 2001) goes up to 46.37, and his strike rate to 89.60. Factoring in the average and strike rate of other batsmen in those matches, his average factor goes up to 1.61, and the strike rate is clearly ahead of Kohli's. Also, Tendulkar's innings-per-century improves considerably.The century machinesKohli has racked up hundreds for fun in his ODI career so far, but the numbers below indicate Tendulkar was well ahead of his peers on this factor too. During the period after he started opening the batting, Tendulkar scored a hundred every 6.86 innings when batting in the top four, compared to other top-four batsmen who scored one every 24.7 innings. That means Tendulkar was around 3.6 times better than the others batting in the top four during that period. For Kohli, that ratio is about 3.11, which shows clearly that scoring hundreds has become a lot easier now than in the first half of Tendulkar's era. These ratios indicate just how remarkable both batsmen have been in their rates of scoring hundreds, but Tendulkar was at an even higher level compared to his peers, than Kohli has been in the current era.Innings per 100 when batting in the top 4* All other batsmen in the top 4 in all ODIs during Kohli's career/ between March 1994-2001The chase mastersKohli's numbers in run-chases are outstanding, but in that 1994-2001 period Tendulkar's stats in chases were pretty good too: he averaged 50.28, at a strike rate of 94.65, to Kohli's average of 68.54 at a scoring rate of 94.51. Applying the same yardstick in case of the overall numbers, Tendulkar's strike rate ratio is better, but Kohli's greatest strength has been his ability to make big scores in run-chases and stay unbeaten. Kohli has remained not-out 28 times in 116 innings when batting second, giving him a much higher average, and hence a higher average ratio.Kohli v Tendulkar, in chasesAttribute Virat Kohli Tendulkar (Mar '94-2001) Inns 116 97 Ave 68.54 50.29 Ave factor^ 2.2 1.75 SR 94.51 94.66 SR factor* 1.11 1.29 ^ Average of all other batsmen in those matches* SR of all other batsmen in those matchesThe presence of other big-hitters in the line-up has allowed Kohli to often bat in a more measured manner, but Kohli's special skill is his ability to play long innings at more-than-acceptable scoring rates, while cutting out the risks and increasing the success percentage.

They are the only batsmen to reach this landmark with centuries. With Kohli smashing Tendulkar's record of fastest to 10,000 ODI runs in terms of innings, it is a good time to compare Kohli's current stats with Tendulkar's, at the time the latter reached the landmark. The overall numbers When looking at the stats in isolation, there's little doubt that Kohli bosses the numbers. In terms of innings to reach the 10,000-run mark, he is 21% better than Tendulkar; in terms of average and innings per century, he is 40% better; his strike rate advantage is relatively lower at 7%. ESPNcricinfo Ltd ESPNcricinfo Ltd ESPNcricinfo Ltd Based on these numbers, there is no doubt who wins the contest, but some of those comparisons are a bit unfair to Tendulkar. It's clear that ODIs are far more high-scoring now than they were when Tendulkar scored his first 10,000 runs; any comparison of numbers, especially strike rates, needs to take that into account. In the 266 matches that Tendulkar played to reach the 10,000-run landmark, the average strike rate by other batsmen was 71.51; in Kohli's era it is 85.99. The average for other batsmen during Tendulkar's first 266 matches was 27.90; for Kohli it is 31.73. Taking that into account, it is clear that Tendulkar exceeds the average strike rate of his era by a much higher margin than Kohli, though Kohli remains better in terms of the ratio of averages. Tendulkar also won more Man-of-the-Match awards, but that is, to some extent, also a factor of the quality of his team-mates during that period.

Factoring in the average and strike rate of other batsmen in those matches, his average factor goes up to 1.61, and the strike rate is clearly ahead of Kohli's. Also, Tendulkar's innings-per-century improves considerably. The century machines Kohli has racked up hundreds for fun in his ODI career so far, but the numbers below indicate Tendulkar was well ahead of his peers on this factor too. During the period after he started opening the batting, Tendulkar scored a hundred every 6.86 innings when batting in the top four, compared to other top-four batsmen who scored one every 24.7 innings. That means Tendulkar was around 3.6 times better than the others batting in the top four during that period. For Kohli, that ratio is about 3.11, which shows clearly that scoring hundreds has become a lot easier now than in the first half of Tendulkar's era.

Founder and chairman of pro-democracy organisation United Civil Front, Kasparov has been a figurehead in opposition to Putin's government. When standing outside the court in Moscow where members of the protest band Pussy Riot were being sentenced in 2012, Kasparov was arrested and beaten by police. He also spent five days in a Russian jail after he co-led an opposition march against Putin in Moscow in 2007. His application for citizenship received support from politicians and organisations within Croatia. After they met in January, the Croatian president, Ivo Josipović, praised Kasparov for providing \"great moral support to Croatia\" during the country's war of independence between 1991-95. Kasparov is widely perceived in the country as having been a vocal supporter of Croatian independence. The Croatian war veterans' association has encouraged issuing him a passport. Kasparov and Josipović also played a game of chess together, after which the president boasted on social media that he held the grandmaster off for 33 moves. This week in the Croatian holiday town of Opatija, Kasparov discussed the idea of launching a local chess club with the minister of education and sports, leading to speculation in local media that he might settle in the town now that he has citizenship. In a letter published in Croatian media, Kasparov also spoke of his desire to represent Croatia if he decides to run for presidency of the World Chess Federation (Fide) in 2014, as is widely expected. The news of his Croatian passport follows an earlier request for citizenship in Latvia last year, which he said at the time would help him to feel more secure as he pursued political activities in Russia.

Our editors will review what you’ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article. Garry Kasparov is a Soviet-born chess master who became the world chess champion in 1985. Kasparov was the youngest world chess champion (at 22 years of age), and he is also known for his matches against a computer known as Deep Blue in 1996 and 1997. He became an outspoken critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin in the 21st century. In an essay that Garry Kasparov wrote in 2018 for the Encyclopædia Britannica Anniversary Edition: 250 Years of Excellence, he expressed less concern about dystopian visions of artificial intelligence than about political polarization and the rise of authoritarianism around the world: “The political center is being hollowed out, with extremist positions leading to backlash and whiplash.” Garry Kasparov, in full Garri Kimovich Kasparov, original name Garri Weinstein or Harry Weinstein, (born April 13, 1963, Baku, Azerbaijan, U.S.S.R. [now Baku, Azerbaijan]), Soviet-born chess master who became the world chess champion in 1985. Kasparov was the youngest world chess champion (at 22 years of age) and the first world chess champion to be defeated by a supercomputer in a competitive match. Kasparov was born to a Jewish father and an Armenian mother. He began playing chess at age 6, by age 13 was the Soviet youth champion, and won his first international tournament at age 16 in 1979. Kasparov became an international grandmaster in 1980. From 1973 to 1978 he studied under former world champion Mikhail Botvinnik. Kasparov first challenged the reigning world champion Anatoly Karpov in a 1984–85 match, after he survived the Fédération Internationale des Échecs (FIDE; the international chess federation) series of elimination matches. Kasparov lost four out of the first nine games but then adopted a careful defensive stance, taking an extraordinarily long series of drawn games with the champion. With Kasparov finally having won three games from the exhausted Karpov, FIDE halted the series after 48 games, a decision protested by Kasparov. In the two players’ rematch in 1985, Kasparov narrowly defeated Karpov in a 24-game series and thereby became the youngest official champion in the history of the game. In 1993 Kasparov and the English grandmaster Nigel Short left FIDE and formed a rival organization, the Professional Chess Association (PCA). In response, FIDE stripped the title of world champion from Kasparov, who defeated Short that same year to become the PCA world champion. In 1995 he successfully defended his PCA title against Viswanathan Anand of India; the PCA disbanded in 1996. In 1996 Kasparov defeated a powerful IBM custom-built chess computer known as Deep Blue in a match that attracted worldwide attention. Kasparov and the team of Deep Blue programmers agreed to have a rematch in 1997. Deep Blue’s intelligence was upgraded, and the machine prevailed. Kasparov resigned in the last game of the six-game match after 19 moves, granting the win to Deep Blue. In 2000 Kasparov lost a 16-game championship match to Vladimir Kramnik of Russia. Kasparov retired from competitive chess in 2005, though not from involvement in chess. In particular, he produced an acclaimed series of books, Kasparov on My Great Predecessors (2003–06), that covered all the world chess champions from Wilhelm Steinitz through Karpov, as well as many other great players. In Deep Thinking: Where Machine Intelligence Ends and Human Creativity Begins (2017), Kasparov offered details of his 1997 match with Deep Blue while praising technological progress. Following his retirement, Kasparov continued to participate in exhibition matches and to coach other players still active in competitive chess. Kasparov also remained in the public eye with his decision in 2005 to start a political organization, the United Civil Front, to oppose Russian Pres. Vladimir Putin.

He was baptized and in November 1918 accompanied Canon Cosgrave back to England - the Canon having retired from the Ranchi school to take up the parish of Darlington. Jaipal Singh arrived in England in the aftermaths of the First World War and initially stayed in Darlington with the Canon. Three wealthy unmarried women, the Forsters, helped to take care of Jaipal Singh financially. He was sent to St Augustine's College in Canterbury to train for the priesthood, but after two terms, Bishop Arthur Mesacknight, the warden, sent him to Oxford - using his connections with Dr James, the president of St John's College. Jaipal Singh matriculated at St John's College, Oxford, in Michaelmas 1922. He was awarded the Hertfordshire Scholarship of forty pounds by Bishop Knight and the Forsters bore most of the rest of his Oxford bills. Jaipal Singh studied PPE and was awarded a 4th in 1926. He was elected Secretary in 1924 and then President in 1925 of the St John's College Debating Society.

Jaipal Singh started the Oxford Hermits - a sports society for 'Asiatics' in Oxford - they mainly played hockey. Jaipal Singh then took the Indian Civil Service (ICS) exams, and was a probationary student at St John's. In the meantime, Singh was involved in Indian students' hockey tours of Europe and the formation of the India Hockey Federation. In 1928, he captained the India Hockey Team at the Amsterdam Olympics. They won all their games without conceding a goal, and were awarded the gold medal. He often frequented Veeraswamy's restaurant in Regent Street and the victorious team were also feted at the restaurant and at 21 Cromwell Road. Having taken part in the Olympics, Singh's ICS training was delayed and he then decided to quit the ICS. Through the Darlington MP, Lord Pake Pense, Singh was introduced to Viscount Bearstead, Chairman of Shell Transport and Trading Company who arranged for a job for Singh with the Burnham-Shell Oil Storage and Distributing Company of India. He was the first Indian to be appointed to a covenanted mercantile assistant in Royal Dutch Shell group, and after a probationary period in London was sent to Calcutta. In Calcutta, Singh met many British officials, clergymen and Indians through his contacts from his time in Britain. He met and married Tara Majumdar, the daughter of P. K. and Agnes Majumdar and grand-daughter of W. C. Bonnerjee. Singh took up a number of educational posts, including a position teaching commerce at Achimota College, Gold Coast, and then soon got involved in politics back in India.

He often frequented Veeraswamy's restaurant in Regent Street and the victorious team were also feted at the restaurant and at 21 Cromwell Road. Having taken part in the Olympics, Singh's ICS training was delayed and he then decided to quit the ICS. Through the Darlington MP, Lord Pake Pense, Singh was introduced to Viscount Bearstead, Chairman of Shell Transport and Trading Company who arranged for a job for Singh with the Burnham-Shell Oil Storage and Distributing Company of India. He was the first Indian to be appointed to a covenanted mercantile assistant in Royal Dutch Shell group, and after a probationary period in London was sent to Calcutta. In Calcutta, Singh met many British officials, clergymen and Indians through his contacts from his time in Britain. He met and married Tara Majumdar, the daughter of P. K. and Agnes Majumdar and grand-daughter of W. C. Bonnerjee. Singh took up a number of educational posts, including a position teaching commerce at Achimota College, Gold Coast, and then soon got involved in politics back in India.

He studied at St Paul's School in Ranchi (Bihar) and was taken under the wing of the Principal, Canon Cosgrave. He was baptized and in November 1918 accompanied Canon Cosgrave back to England - the Canon having retired from the Ranchi school to take up the parish of Darlington. Jaipal Singh arrived in England in the aftermaths of the First World War and initially stayed in Darlington with the Canon. Three wealthy unmarried women, the Forsters, helped to take care of Jaipal Singh financially. He was sent to St Augustine's College in Canterbury to train for the priesthood, but after two terms, Bishop Arthur Mesacknight, the warden, sent him to Oxford - using his connections with Dr James, the president of St John's College. Jaipal Singh matriculated at St John's College, Oxford, in Michaelmas 1922. He was awarded the Hertfordshire Scholarship of forty pounds by Bishop Knight and the Forsters bore most of the rest of his Oxford bills. Jaipal Singh studied PPE and was awarded a 4th in 1926. He was elected Secretary in 1924 and then President in 1925 of the St John's College Debating Society. He was a member of the Essay Society, a member of the college football XI in 1925-6, and the college hockey XI throughout his time at the college. Jaipal Singh also represented the University Hockey XI in Varsity matches from 1924 to 1926 and hence was awarded a hockey Blue. Jaipal Singh started the Oxford Hermits - a sports society for 'Asiatics' in Oxford - they mainly played hockey. Jaipal Singh then took the Indian Civil Service (ICS) exams, and was a probationary student at St John's. In the meantime, Singh was involved in Indian students' hockey tours of Europe and the formation of the India Hockey Federation. In 1928, he captained the India Hockey Team at the Amsterdam Olympics.

In the meanwhile “the government has made a necessary change in the eligibility criteria for a person getting the India’s highest civilian honour”1 in any field of “human endeavour”. There have been extensive discussions and media campaign for conferment of Bharat Ratna favouring certain sports personalities. Strangely, not once did the Indian media, print and/or electronic, ever recall the role and sacrifice of the legendary hockey player Jaipal Singh during the CWG or in the post-CWG period. When I focused the case of Jaipal Singh for the award of Bharat Ratna in online comments of a leading English daily recently, there was a counter-question: “Who was that?” The person who asked the question and many like him do not know Jaipal Singh or his role as a hockey player in colonial India. This is the real crux. We are very knowledgeable people in many respects. At the same time we are equally forgetful of inconvenient achievers. The case of Jaipal Singh falls in this category, though India, under his stewardship, reached the pinnacle of glory at the Amsterdam Summer Olympics in 1928: it won its first ever Olympic Gold. Indeed that was Asia’s first Olympic Gold too. Ignorance Cannot be Basis for Denial of Justice to Jaipal Singh JAIPAL was born on January 3, 1903 at Tapkara village under Khunti subdivision (now a full-fledged district) in Ranchi district in Jharkhand. Takpara is a Munda village and Jaipal was Munda, a tribe of the sylvan country. His family had embraced Christianity. Sparks of his talent coupled with leadership qualities were noticed early in the day by the missionaries of SPG Mission Church of England. After initial schooling, Jaipal shifted from his village to Ranchi and studied at St. Paul’s run by the said missionaries. His character and qualities enamoured almost all whoever came in touch with him. A hockey player of exceptional calibre and abilities, he exhibited his mark quite early in his youth. The Principal of St. Paul’s sent him to the Oxford University for higher education. Jaipal did not take much time to demonstrate his mettle as an ace hockey player in the celebrated University and soon charmed his way into the Oxford University Hockey Team. “The hallmarks of his game as a deep defender were his clean tackling, sensible game-play and well-directed hard hits. He was the most versatile player in the Oxford University Hockey Team. His contribution to the University Hockey Team was recognised and he became the first Indian student to be conferred the ‘Oxford Blue’ in Hockey.”2 He was a prolific columnist on sports, particularly hockey. Leading English newspapers used to publish regularly his columns on the game, which were widely acclaimed by readers. In 1928, he was selected for captaincy of the Indian Hockey Team for the Amsterdam Summer Olympics. It was both a unique honour and tough challenge that called for his sacrifice. Conflict between Personal Interest and National Dignity: Jaipal Sacrificed his Personal Interest A student of Economics (Honours) at Oxford University, Jaipal passed his examinations with flying colours. He took the ICS examination, which was the dream of every Indian youth in the colonial era. He cleared it with the highest marks in the interview. While he was under-going training in England as an ICS probationer, he was selected as the captain of the Indian team for the Amsterdam Summer Olympics. It was a call from his motherland that presented to him the defining moment. He was asked to reach Amsterdam and join the team immediately. When he applied for leave of absence to take up the charge of captaincy, the India Office, London rejected his prayer outright. He defied the refusal order of the India Office which conducted the affairs of the Government of India from London. The import of his disobedience was pregnant with severe consequences. Undaunted, Jaipal proceeded to Amsterdam and joined the hockey team for practice. He was well aware that his conscious decision and calculated move was fraught with the inevitable disciplinary action: he had qualified himself by his defiance for major punishment. Charges of disobedience and indiscipline against an ICS probationer were too serious to overlook by the colonial masters. Jaipal was without parallel in this behalf by responding to his patriotic impulse as well as conscience. He was indeed peerless, though history is yet to accord due importance to this event. The Imperial Service was known for its strict rules, rigid discipline and unplugging adherence to unbending procedures. Jaipal nonchalantly flouted the mighty authorities. The Indian Hockey Team for Amsterdam had the following members: Jaipal Singh (Captain), Richard Allen, Dhyan Chand, Maurice Gateley, William Goodsir-Cullen, Leslie Hammond, Feroze Khan, George Marthins, Rex Norris, Broome Pinniger (Vice-Captain), Michael Rocque, Frederic Seaman, Ali Shaukat and Sayed Yusuf.3 Nine countries divided into two Divisions A and B participated in the Olympic Hockey. In all, 31 players scored 69 goals in 18 matches. Of them, India [in Division A] scored 29 goals—the largest number by Major Dhyan Chand, 14, followed by Feroze Khan and George Martins, five each, Frederic Seaman, three, Ali Saukat and Maurice Gateley, one each. In the final match, India defeated Holland by 3-0 goals. Germany and Belgium had to contend with the third and fourth positions. In the final against Holland, however, Jaipal Singh did not play. Serious differences of opinion had cropped up between the team manager A. B. Rossier and the Captain. As a result, Jaipal Singh opted out of the final match. The Vice-Captain Broome Pinniger stewarded the team to victory by inflicting a crashing defeat on the rival Holland team. Part-II A Bengali Son-in-law: a Visionary AT the close of the Games, Jaipal returned to England. He was personally congratulated by the then Viceroy of India, Lord Irwin, for his excellent captaincy and the team performance. The India Office appeared to have relented under the Olympic glow and softened down their stubborn attitude. Jaipal was asked to rejoin his training with the stipulation that he would undergo it for an extra year. This implied that his probation was extended by a year. He felt that his dignity and self-esteem were compromised by this stipulation. So he did not rejoin the ICS training; instead he returned to India. A British oil major, Burmah Shell, offered him a very lucrative job while he was in England. Jaipal joined the company at Calcutta. There at Calcutta Jaipal Singh met his future wife, Tara Winfred Majumdar. She was the grand-daughter (daughter’s daughter) of Womesh Chunder Bonnerjee, the first President of the Indian National Congress (1885). Their marriage, however, did not last long. Educational assignments took Jaipal away from Calcutta to the Gold Coast in Ghana, Africa and to Raipur (the present capital of Chhattisgarh) in the then Central Provinces and Berar. He further moved to Rajputana where he was appointed the Coloni-sation Minister and Revenue Commissioner in the Princely State of Bikaner. His unimpeachable performance as the Minister and Revenue Commissioner earned him further rewards.. He was elevated to the post of Foreign Secretary of the state of Bikener. At this stage, he felt a profound urge to do something for his people, the neglected and exploited tribal communities in Chhota Nagpur in Bihar. He returned to Bihar and met the President, Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee, Dr Rajendra Prasad, at Sadaquat Ashram, Patna. The Sadaquat Ashram gave a cold reception to Jaipal. A sportsman does not take defeat as a defeat; instead he takes it as a challenge and turns it into an opportunity. Jaipal was a sportsman to the core. When one door closes before a determined man, another opens up simultaneously. At this juncture, the Governor of Bihar and Orissa, Sir Maurice Hallet, offered membership of his Legislative Council to Jaipal. He politely declined it. Then the Governor as also Robert Russel, the Chief Secretary, advised him to take up the cause of the tribal people who were already in a restive mood. Jaipal Singh went to Ranchi and there he was received tumultuously by the tribals. The rest is history. His dream for a separate tribal State fructified in the midnight of November 15, 2000—a new State of Jharkhand came into being. Jaipal Singh was a man of many parts—an accomplished writer, iconic hockey captain, excellent orator, visionary, patriot, and an indefatigable champion for the tribal cause. When he was selected as the captain for the Indian hockey squad for the Olympics, the authorities in The India Office refused him leave to play at the Amsterdam Olympics. He had limited options: either Olympic hockey or ICS. “I did not get leave! I decided to defy the ruling and take the consequences,” he said later. By opting for the former, he brought the first Olympic laurels for India. His countrymen, it seems, have forgotten him. Subhas Chandra Bose earned his first feather in his patriotic cap by resigning from the ICS. He is cheered all through as courageous and spirited for that step. Surendranath Banerjea, who was dismissed from the ICS (1874) for misconduct, has been lionised in history. They held that the Britishers’ loss was India’s gain because he (Surendranath) joined politics and led the anti-partition agitation of Bengal and the swadeshi movement (1905-11). Though Jaipal voluntarily took up the hockey captaincy in the teeth of official refusal for grant of leave from training schedules during his ICS probation, his countrymen do not count or even recall this as a unique sacrifice. Bengalis have swept under the carpet the fact that the Munda youth was one of their most shinning sons-in-law. Nothing is ever attempted officially or otherwise at the national level to refresh public memories over Jaipal Singh’s contributions and accomplish-ments in various fields. His dream of a tribal State has materialised partially into reality. His vision for the Adivasi State was bigger, that was to comprise the tribal districts of Bengal and Madhya Pradesh, besides those of Bihar and Orissa. Evaluation of a person in India is influenced more by the social class and identity he bears on his sleeves. If one is from the lower social strata, he stands to face and embrace prejudice from the entrenched privileged Indians, irrespective of his contribution to the nation. Prejudice becomes insurmountable for them; even their patriotic sacrifices are not to be counted. Jaipal Singh Munda is another case in point. Let ignorance in certain quarters not be the touchstone for injustice against him. It will be a national shame.

टेनिस खेलना शुरू किया। उनके पिता के पास इतने पैसे नहीं थे जो उन्हें पेशेवर ट्रेनिंग दिलवा सकें। इसके लिए उनके पिता ने कुछ बड़े व्यापारिक समुदायों से स्पान्सर्शिप ली, जिसमें प्रमुख हैं जीवेके इंड्रस्ट्रीज और एडीडास। इन दोनों कंपनियों ने उन्हें 12 साल की उम्र से ही स्पान्सर करना शुरु कर दिया। उसके बाद उनके पिता ने उनकी ट्रेनिंग का जिम्मा लिया। महेश भूपति के पिता सी. के. भूपति की देखरेख में

A broken service game is one thing, but a broken engagement or a broken heart, is quite another. ( Watch Video ) Earlier in the week, the 23-year-old's father Imran, who coaches Sania and manages her career, called off his daughter's engagement to Mohammed Sohrab Mirza. Sania was formally engaged to the fellow Hyderabadi and longtime friend, now studying business in the United Kingdom, at a luxury hotel near her home last July. The Indian star categorically refused to get into the why and what of the matter, but confirmed her engagement was off. \"We were friends for half a decade, but found ourselves incompatible during our engagement period. I wish Sohrab the best in life,\" she said. Even before the two got engaged, questions were doing the rounds about whether Mohammed could cope with the demands of being life-partner to a widely-travelled, hugely-popular athlete. Sania, who has been struggling with the differences for the last couple of months, hasn't taken the break-up well as her results on court show. However, she's doing what she always does at a time of crisis - surround herself with family and friends. As it stands, Sania will have to turn her focus to the courts, and in time might find comfort there. She flies out to Kuala Lumpur late on Friday, where she leads India's challenge in the Fed Cup Asia Oceania Group II competition, starting February 2.

A broken service game is one thing, but a broken engagement or a broken heart, is quite another. ( Watch Video ) Earlier in the week, the 23-year-old's father Imran, who coaches Sania and manages her career, called off his daughter's engagement to Mohammed Sohrab Mirza. Sania was formally engaged to the fellow Hyderabadi and longtime friend, now studying business in the United Kingdom, at a luxury hotel near her home last July. The Indian star categorically refused to get into the why and what of the matter, but confirmed her engagement was off. \"We were friends for half a decade, but found ourselves incompatible during our engagement period. I wish Sohrab the best in life,\" she said. Even before the two got engaged, questions were doing the rounds about whether Mohammed could cope with the demands of being life-partner to a widely-travelled, hugely-popular athlete. Sania, who has been struggling with the differences for the last couple of months, hasn't taken the break-up well as her results on court show. However, she's doing what she always does at a time of crisis - surround herself with family and friends. As it stands, Sania will have to turn her focus to the courts, and in time might find comfort there. She flies out to Kuala Lumpur late on Friday, where she leads India's challenge in the Fed Cup Asia Oceania Group II competition, starting February 2.

जन्म: 15 नवम्बर 1986, मुंबई ,महाराष्ट्र) भारत की एक टेनिस खिलाड़ी हैं। 2003 से 2013 में लगातार एक दशक तक उन्होने महिला टेनिस संघ (डब्ल्यू टी ए) के एकल और डबल में शीर्ष भारतीय टेनिस खिलाड़ी के रूप में अपना स्थान बनाए रखने में सफल रही और उसके बाद एकल प्रतियोगिता से उनकी सेवानिवृत्ति के बाद शीर्ष स्थान पर अंकिता रैना विराजमान हुई। मात्र 18 वर्ष की आयु में वैश्विक स्तर पर चर्चित होने वाली इस खिलाड़ी को 2006 में 'पद्मश्री' सम्मान प्रदान किया गया। वे यह सम्मान पाने वाली सबसे कम उम्र की खिलाड़ी है। उन्हें 2006 में अमेरिका में विश्व की टेनिस की दिग्गज हस्तियों के बीच डब्लूटीए का 'मोस्ट इम्प्रेसिव न्यू कमर एवार्ड' प्रदान किया गया था। अपने कॅरियर की शुरुआत उन्होंने 1999 में विश्व जूनियर टेनिस चैम्पियनशिप में हिस्सा लेकर किया। इसके बाद उन्होंने कई अंतररार्ष्ट्रीय मैचों में हिस्सा लिया और सफलता भी

However, if anyone had suggested going into that fourth Test match against Michael Vaughan’s side that Lara would manage to score even a consolation century, then they would have been reminded in no uncertain terms that top-level sport has no place for sentiment. As for the first time ever against England, and in the great man’s career as a whole, Lara had started to look vulnerable against pace in that series in the Caribbean, with his once seemingly razor-sharp reflexes now nowhere to be seen as whispers began to be heard about his future in the game. Lara had already overseen a trio of crushing and demoralising defeats in the first three Tests, and now he stood on the brink of a humiliating and ignominious home series whitewash at the hands of England, a totally unfathomable situation for the once proud West Indies team. And, as if to make matters worse, the skipper and team’s best and most important batsman was also struggling badly for runs against a rampant English fast-bowling attack, with Lara having registered disappointing scores of 23, 0, 0, 8, 36 and 33 in the three Tests leading up to the final match in Antigua. The captain had tried everything to regain just a semblance of form, moving himself up and down the order, tweaking his back lift, but the likes of pacemen Steve Harmison, Matthew Hoggard, Andrew Flintoff and Simon Jones all appeared very much to have the one-time world’s best batsman’s number. In fact, going into that fourth Test the only things that the left-hander really had left to hold on to were the good memories and positive vibes that the pitch at the Recreation Ground had provided him with in the past. And that was because this was the very same venue where in his pomp, Lara had once set the world record for the highest score in Test cricket, also against England and almost exactly 10 years to the day of this very contest. But it is safe to say that not even a man of Lara’s extreme self-belief and confidence would have dared let his mind wander to the possibility of a repeat showing as he went out to toss the coin with his opposite number on the morning of April 10 2004. Within less than an hour’s play though, the captain was already making his way out to the middle after Flintoff had removed opener Daren Ganga for only 10, with the score at 33 for 1. Fourth Test Scorecard Now while the strip at St John’s has always been regarded as being the best pitch to bat on in world cricket, and the tourists’ bowling attack may also have taken their collective foot off the gas a touch with the series already in the bag, no one at the ground or following the match around the world could have predicted just what was about to take place during the course of the next 778 minutes of Test cricket. Lara, do not forget, had also seemingly lost forever the world-record 375 that he had set against England on April 16 1994 when Australia opener Matthew Hayden had made 380 against Zimbabwe in Perth just six months earlier. However, now he set about trying to scale that mountain top one more time, firstly putting on 65 for the second wicket with opener Chris Gayle, followed by a mammoth 332 for the third wicket with Ramnaresh Sarwan as the game moved into the afternoon on day two, with Lara now past a hundred and finally looking somewhere near his best again. But it was probably not until Lara reached stumps on day two though, unbeaten on 313, that people really began to think that history could be about to repeat itself, with the ground heaving and in a state of nervous tension on the morning of the third day. Of course Lara, being Lara, was not to be denied his record-breaking moment in the sun again, and at 11.43 Eastern Caribbean Time, Trinidad’s most famous son swept England off-spinner Gareth Barry for his 42nd boundary to take his own personal score on to 384 not out, and with that he had reclaimed the world record for the highest innings in Test cricket. And, not done there, the left-hander then proceeded to become the first man in the history of the game to score 400 as West Indies declared on a mammoth 751 for five from their 202 overs at the crease, with Lara himself batting for 13 hours, during which time he hit an incredible 43 fours and four sixes. When Lara reached the landmark, he took off his helmet, jumped up in the air, whirled his bat above his head, before kneeling down and kissing the pitch, much as he had also done 10 years previously, although the scenes were far less chaotic the second time around. Maybe it was relief, maybe it was shock, probably a mixture of both, but either way Lara had somehow managed to yet again defy the odds, his fading reflexes and England’s vaunted pace attack to produce one final great innings that re-established the West Indian’s place at the summit of the Test-match batting arena.

Over 40 local students, who have completed programmes in Education at the University of Sheffield, will also be presented to the University´s Vice-Chancellor, Professor Bob Boucher at the degree ceremony. The ceremony will take place at the Trinidad Hilton, Port of Spain at 6pm on Wednesday 10 January 2007. Brian Lara was educated at St Joseph´s Roman Catholic Primary School and subsequently at Fatima College. In 1990, he made his Test debut for the West Indies against Pakistan and in 1994 he demolished the English bowling attack at Antigua, making 375 and so breaking Sir Gary Sobers´ Test record score of 365, which had stood since 1958. Forty-nine days later, he rewrote the record books again by hitting 501 not out for Warwickshire against Durham in the English County Championship, to achieve the highest score in first-class cricket, beating Hanif Mohammad´s 499 made in 1959. On 12 April 2004, Brian took his score to 400 to reclaim the world Test batting record – a feat that places him alongside Shane Warne as the most gifted cricketer of this or any other era. Brian will have the honour of captaining his team in the ICC Cricket World Cup, which is being held in the Caribbean for the first time later this year. Off the cricket ground, Brian established the Pearl and Bunty Lara Foundation, a charitable organisation which he set up in memory of his parents to address health and social care issues that were close to their hearts. He is also Ambassador for Sport for the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, travelling on a diplomatic passport to promote his country throughout the world.Professor Bob Boucher, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Sheffield, said: \"Brian Lara is one of the most talented cricketers in the world today and I am delighted to be awarding him an honorary degree on behalf of the University of Sheffield. His achievements – both cricketing and humanitarian – have brought honour and distinction to the islands of Trinidad and Tobago.\" Notes for Editors: Photo opportunities will be available.

Lara, and six others, had earlier been excluded from the squad for the Guyana Test owing to the sponsorship row between Digicel, the team sponsors, and Cable & Wireless, the players' sponsors.According to a Press Trust of India report, in a letter to Roger Braithwaite, the Chief Executive Officer of West Indies Cricket Board, Lara said: \"In the circumstances, where neither my loyalty to the players nor my loyalty to West Indies cricket can be denied, I confirm that I am ready, willing and able to continue participating in West Indies cricket, provided that, even at this late stage, the best team will be selected with an assurance from all of the parties that the outstanding issues would be brought to the table and discussed.\"The exclusion of the talismanic Lara from the squad sent shock waves around the West Indies and even several South African players hoped for the issue to be settled at the earlier and the best team to be selected. Lara continued: \"I would also like to see an amicable resolution to the outstanding issues in an atmosphere of mutual compromise and respect, which would all redound to uplifting the morale and pride of the West Indian people who are passionate about the sport.\"The West Indies Players' Association also backed Lara's stand and the president, Dinanath Ramnarine, said, \"WIPA strongly deprecates the manner in which the Board issued an invitation to Brian Lara to make himself available for selection to the squad for the first Test match.\"Brian LaraWest IndiesSouth Africa tour of West Indies Matches (11) Matches (11) (11) SL v PAK (1) SL v PAK (1) (1) SA-W in ENG (1) SA-W in ENG (1) (1) County DIV1 (5) County DIV1 (5) (5) County DIV2 (3) County DIV2 (3) (3) TNPL (1) TNPL (1) (1) Live • 2nd TEST • Galle • 2nd TEST (15.1 ov) & Day 3 - Session 2: Sri Lanka lead by 206 runs.

In pursuit of 301, Pietersen reached 100 with a six, but when he fell next ball, 32 were still needed. Paul Nixon hit four fours in 38 but was out with three runs required, leaving Stuart Broad to hit the winning blow. Earlier Chris Gayle smashed three sixes in a dazzling 79 but to the crowd's dismay Lara was run out for 18. On a day of high emotion as Duncan Fletcher bowed out as England coach, Michael Vaughan, who had earlier taken 3-39 with the ball, hit six fours and two sixes to get England into a good position. But after he was run out for 79, they lost Paul Collingwood, Andrew Flintoff and Jamie Dalrymple in quick succession to leave Pietersen much to do. In partnership with the combative Nixon, however, Pietersen reduced the equation to 54 from the final 36 balls. The showman moved into the 90s with a boundary and reached three figures with a memorable swipe over mid-wicket off Jerome Taylor for six, but attempting to repeat the stroke to the next delivery he lost his leg-stump. Nixon hit three fours in four balls and took England within three runs but fell to a slower ball from Dwayne Bravo as the Windies scented victory, but 20-year-old Broad, on his World Cup debut, had the final say. Pietersen's extravagant shots put England on course Given that his side struggled to post a total against South Africa, Vaughan opted to field first when he won the toss for the sixth time in succession. Gayle had failed to make a half-century in eight previous matches in the tournament. But the pace and bounce in the wicket proved ideal for his flowing blade and 22 came in one over from Liam Plunkett. There were some blistering shots to delight the crowd, including one bouncer he deftly cut to the boundary. One savage straight drive might well have decapitated a less nimble umpire than Simon Taufel. England took the second powerplay after 22 overs, boldly recalling the erratic James Anderson, who might have had a wicket if Plunkett had reached Gayle's thick edge diving forward at third man. But in the next over from Flintoff, Gayle was caught, smartly taken in similar fashion by the alert Broad, to end an opening stand of 131 and bring Lara out to a tumultuous reception. Smith fell to one of the great catches, Paul Collingwood thrusting out his right hand at full stretch, but after a fluent drive off the back foot and a deft leg glance there was the dismissal that the vast majority of those present did not want. 606: DEBATE What a fantastic finish but sad to see the back of that man Mr Lara FB Lara set off for a run but Marlon Samuels sent him back and Pietersen swooped at mid-on, leaving the legendary left-hander in mid-pitch. After Lara saluted the crowd the atmosphere changed completely, as if someone had turned a volume switch off, but instead of crumbling under the gravity of the situation, Samuels became inspired. Plunkett disappeared for 24 in another over as Samuels began to atone for his grievous blunder. He recorded the fifty partnership with Chanderpaul from only 27 balls. One shot matched Gayle's for ingenuity, clipping a leg-side full toss from Flintoff between his pads to the square-leg boundary. The announcement of his fifty from 37 balls was cheered enthusiastically by the crowd to show there was no lasting animosity towards Samuels, a player they hope will be a new hero in the post-Lara era.

The showman moved into the 90s with a boundary and reached three figures with a memorable swipe over mid-wicket off Jerome Taylor for six, but attempting to repeat the stroke to the next delivery he lost his leg-stump. Nixon hit three fours in four balls and took England within three runs but fell to a slower ball from Dwayne Bravo as the Windies scented victory, but 20-year-old Broad, on his World Cup debut, had the final say. Pietersen's extravagant shots put England on course Given that his side struggled to post a total against South Africa, Vaughan opted to field first when he won the toss for the sixth time in succession. Gayle had failed to make a half-century in eight previous matches in the tournament. But the pace and bounce in the wicket proved ideal for his flowing blade and 22 came in one over from Liam Plunkett. There were some blistering shots to delight the crowd, including one bouncer he deftly cut to the boundary. One savage straight drive might well have decapitated a less nimble umpire than Simon Taufel. England took the second powerplay after 22 overs, boldly recalling the erratic James Anderson, who might have had a wicket if Plunkett had reached Gayle's thick edge diving forward at third man. But in the next over from Flintoff, Gayle was caught, smartly taken in similar fashion by the alert Broad, to end an opening stand of 131 and bring Lara out to a tumultuous reception. Smith fell to one of the great catches, Paul Collingwood thrusting out his right hand at full stretch, but after a fluent drive off the back foot and a deft leg glance there was the dismissal that the vast majority of those present did not want. 606: DEBATE What a fantastic finish but sad to see the back of that man Mr Lara FB Lara set off for a run but Marlon Samuels sent him back and Pietersen swooped at mid-on, leaving the legendary left-hander in mid-pitch. After Lara saluted the crowd the atmosphere changed completely, as if someone had turned a volume switch off, but instead of crumbling under the gravity of the situation, Samuels became inspired. Plunkett disappeared for 24 in another over as Samuels began to atone for his grievous blunder. He recorded the fifty partnership with Chanderpaul from only 27 balls.

In pursuit of 301, Pietersen reached 100 with a six, but when he fell next ball, 32 were still needed. Paul Nixon hit four fours in 38 but was out with three runs required, leaving Stuart Broad to hit the winning blow. Earlier Chris Gayle smashed three sixes in a dazzling 79 but to the crowd's dismay Lara was run out for 18. On a day of high emotion as Duncan Fletcher bowed out as England coach, Michael Vaughan, who had earlier taken 3-39 with the ball, hit six fours and two sixes to get England into a good position. But after he was run out for 79, they lost Paul Collingwood, Andrew Flintoff and Jamie Dalrymple in quick succession to leave Pietersen much to do. In partnership with the combative Nixon, however, Pietersen reduced the equation to 54 from the final 36 balls.

The announcement of his fifty from 37 balls was cheered enthusiastically by the crowd to show there was no lasting animosity towards Samuels, a player they hope will be a new hero in the post-Lara era. In pursuit of 301, Pietersen reached 100 with a six, but when he fell next ball, 32 were still needed. Paul Nixon hit four fours in 38 but was out with three runs required, leaving Stuart Broad to hit the winning blow. Earlier Chris Gayle smashed three sixes in a dazzling 79 but to the crowd's dismay Lara was run out for 18. On a day of high emotion as Duncan Fletcher bowed out as England coach, Michael Vaughan, who had earlier taken 3-39 with the ball, hit six fours and two sixes to get England into a good position. But after he was run out for 79, they lost Paul Collingwood, Andrew Flintoff and Jamie Dalrymple in quick succession to leave Pietersen much to do. In partnership with the combative Nixon, however, Pietersen reduced the equation to 54 from the final 36 balls. The showman moved into the 90s with a boundary and reached three figures with a memorable swipe over mid-wicket off Jerome Taylor for six, but attempting to repeat the stroke to the next delivery he lost his leg-stump. Nixon hit three fours in four balls and took England within three runs but fell to a slower ball from Dwayne Bravo as the Windies scented victory, but 20-year-old Broad, on his World Cup debut, had the final say. Pietersen's extravagant shots put England on course Given that his side struggled to post a total against South Africa, Vaughan opted to field first when he won the toss for the sixth time in succession. Gayle had failed to make a half-century in eight previous matches in the tournament. But the pace and bounce in the wicket proved ideal for his flowing blade and 22 came in one over from Liam Plunkett. There were some blistering shots to delight the crowd, including one bouncer he deftly cut to the boundary. One savage straight drive might well have decapitated a less nimble umpire than Simon Taufel. England took the second powerplay after 22 overs, boldly recalling the erratic James Anderson, who might have had a wicket if Plunkett had reached Gayle's thick edge diving forward at third man. But in the next over from Flintoff, Gayle was caught, smartly taken in similar fashion by the alert Broad, to end an opening stand of 131 and bring Lara out to a tumultuous reception. Smith fell to one of the great catches, Paul Collingwood thrusting out his right hand at full stretch, but after a fluent drive off the back foot and a deft leg glance there was the dismissal that the vast majority of those present did not want. 606: DEBATE What a fantastic finish but sad to see the back of that man Mr Lara FB Lara set off for a run but Marlon Samuels sent him back and Pietersen swooped at mid-on, leaving the legendary left-hander in mid-pitch. After Lara saluted the crowd the atmosphere changed completely, as if someone had turned a volume switch off, but instead of crumbling under the gravity of the situation, Samuels became inspired.

But in the next over from Flintoff, Gayle was caught, smartly taken in similar fashion by the alert Broad, to end an opening stand of 131 and bring Lara out to a tumultuous reception. Smith fell to one of the great catches, Paul Collingwood thrusting out his right hand at full stretch, but after a fluent drive off the back foot and a deft leg glance there was the dismissal that the vast majority of those present did not want. 606: DEBATE What a fantastic finish but sad to see the back of that man Mr Lara FB Lara set off for a run but Marlon Samuels sent him back and Pietersen swooped at mid-on, leaving the legendary left-hander in mid-pitch. After Lara saluted the crowd the atmosphere changed completely, as if someone had turned a volume switch off, but instead of crumbling under the gravity of the situation, Samuels became inspired. Plunkett disappeared for 24 in another over as Samuels began to atone for his grievous blunder. He recorded the fifty partnership with Chanderpaul from only 27 balls. One shot matched Gayle's for ingenuity, clipping a leg-side full toss from Flintoff between his pads to the square-leg boundary.

[18] 1998 के अंत में उन्होंने जिम्बाब्वे के खिलाफ एक टेस्ट मेच में अपना दूसरा शतक बनाया, दोनों परियों में 148 और 44 रन का अधिकतम स्कोर बना कर भी, वे भारत को हारने से नहीं रोक पाए [19]. 1999 में न्यूजीलैण्ड के खिलाफ नव वर्ष के टेस्ट मेच में दोनों परियों में शतक बनाने वाले तीसरे व्यक्ति बन गए, इससे पहले ये रिकॉर्ड विजय हजारे और सुनील गावस्कर ने बनाया था, उन्होंने 190 और 103 * रन बनाये, एक टेस्ट मेच की दोनों पारियों में शतक: न्यूजीलैंड बनाम भारत हैमिल्टन, 2-6 जनवरी 1999. 1999 की शुरुआत में उपमहाद्वीप में उनका दौरा मध्यम रहा, उन्होंने 38.42 के औसत के साथ 269 रन बनाये, इसके बाद 1999 के अंत में न्यूजीलेंड के खिलाफ एक शतक सहित 39.8 के औसत पर 239 रन बनाये। [20] इसके बाद ऑस्ट्रेलिया के खिलाफ श्रृंखला में उनका प्रदर्शन खराब रहा। एक और घरेलू श्रृंखला में दक्षिण अफ्रीका के खिलाफ उनका प्रदर्शन खराब रहा जिसमें उन्होंने केवल 18.7 के औसत पर 187 रन बनाये। उसके बाद उन्होंने 200* का स्कोर बनाया। यह दिल्ली में जिम्बाब्वे के खिलाफ उनका पहला दोहरा शतक था और साथ ही दूसरी पारी में भी 70* रन बनाते हुए उन्होंने भारत को विजय प्राप्त करने में मदद की। 12 महीनों में पहली बार उन्होंने 50 को पार किया और इसके अगले टेस्ट में 162 रन बनाये, उन्होंने 43 के औसत पर दो मेच श्रृंखलाओं में 432 रन बनाए [21]. thumb|2008 में गाले में श्रीलंका के खिलाफ एक टेस्ट मैच के दौरान क्षेत्ररक्षण करते समय द्रविड़ के इशारे.2001 में कोलकाता में ऑस्ट्रेलिया के खिलाफ तीन टेस्ट मैच की श्रृंखला के दूसरे टेस्ट में द्रविड़ ने वीवीएस लक्ष्मण के साथ मिलकर खेल के इतिहास में सबसे बड़ी जीत की वापसी की। इसे जारी रखते हुए, इस जोड़े ने मेच की दूसरी पारी में पांचवें विकेट के लिए 376 रन बनाए। द्रविड़ ने 180 का स्कोर बनाया जबकि लक्ष्मण ने 281 रन बनाये। क्रिकइन्फो-दूसरा टेस्ट: भारत बनाम ऑस्ट्रेलिया कोल्कता में, 11-15 मार्च 2001 हालाँकि द्रविड़ ने दूसरा सबसे अच्छा प्रदर्शन किया, यह उस दिन तक उनके सबसे अच्छे प्रदर्शनों में से एक रहा। बाद में इसी वर्ष में दक्षिण अफ्रीका के खिलाफ पोर्ट एलिजाबेथ में उन्होंने दूसरी पारी में 87 रन बनाते हुए, दक्षिण अफ्रीका की जीत को हार में बदल दिया। यह एक बहुत ही महत्वपूर्ण मेच रहा। क्रिकइन्फो - दूसरा टेस्ट दक्षिण अफ्रीका बनाम भारत, पोर्ट एलिजाबेथ में, 16-20 नवम्बर 2001. 2002 वह वर्ष था जब द्रविड़ ने तेंडुलकर की छाया से उभरना शुरू किया और अपने आप को भारत के प्रमुख टेस्ट बल्लेबाज के रूप में स्थापित कर लिया। अप्रेल के महीने में, जॉर्ज टाउन, वेस्ट इंडीज में श्रृंखला के पहले टेस्ट मेच में, उन्होंने नाबाद 144 रन बनाए क्रिकइन्फो-पहला टेस्ट:वेस्ट इंडीज बनाम भारत, जोर्ज टाउन में, 11-15 अप्रैल 2002. इसकी पहली पारी में मर्विन डिल्लन की डिलीवरी पर आउट हो गए थे। बाद में उसी वर्ष में उन्होंने इंग्लैंड (3) और वेस्ट इंडीज (1) के खिलाफ लगातार चार शतक लगाये. अगस्त 2002, में, इंग्लैंड के खिलाफ हेडिंग्ले स्टेडियम, लीड्स में श्रृंखला के तीसरे मैच में पहली पारी में 148 का स्कोर बना कर उन्होंने भारत को प्रसिद्द जीत दिलायी. क्रिकइन्फो- तीसरा टेस्ट: इंग्लेंड बनाम भारत लीड्स में, 22-26 अगस्त 2002 उन्हें इस प्रदर्शन के लिए मेन ऑफ़ दी मैच का पुरस्कार मिला। इंग्लैंड के खिलाफ चार टेस्ट मैच की श्रृंखला में कुल 602 रन बना कर उन्होंने मेन ऑफ़ दी सीरीज का पुरस्कार भी जीता। 2003- 2004 के दौरे में, द्रविड़ ने तीन दोहरे शतक लगाये, न्यूजीलैंड, ऑस्ट्रेलिया और पाकिस्तान प्रत्येक के खिलाफ एक एक. ऑस्ट्रेलिया के खिलाफ एडिलेड में चार मैच की श्रृंखला के दूसरे मैच में, द्रविड़ और वीवीएस लक्ष्मण की बल्लेबाजी जोड़ी ऑस्ट्रेलिया पर भारी पड़ी, ऑस्ट्रेलिया के विशाल 556 के स्कोर के जवाब में भारत ने 4 विकेट पर केवल 85 रन बनाए थे जब इस जोड़ी ने हाथ मिलाया। जब उनकी साझेदारी को तोड़ा गया तब तक वे 303 रन बना चुके थे। लक्ष्मण 148 पर आउट हो गया लेकिन द्रविड़ ने अपनी पारी को जारी रखते हुए 233 रन बनाए। उस समय, यह विदेश में किसी भारतीय के द्वारा बनाया गया अधिकतम व्यक्तिगत स्कोर था। जिस समय द्रविड़ वापस लौटा तब भारत को ऑस्ट्रेलिया की पहली परी के स्कोर तक पहुँचने के लिए 33 रन और चाहिए थे। इसके बाद द्रविड़ ने दूसरी पारी में बहुत ज्यादा दबाव के चलते नाबाद 72 रन बना कर एक प्रसिद्द विजय दिलाई. क्रिकइन्फो- दूसरा टेस्ट: ऑस्ट्रेलिया बनाम भारत, एडिलेड, 12-16 दिसम्बर 2003 द्रविड़ ने ऑस्ट्रेलिया के खिलाफ चार मैच की श्रृंखला में, 103.16 के औसत पर 619 रन का स्कोर बनाया और मेन ऑफ़ दी सीरीज का पुरस्कार जीता। इस दौरे के बाद के भाग में, द्रविड़ ने गांगुली की अनुपस्थिति में, मुल्तान में पहले टेस्ट मैच में भारत को पकिस्तान पर विजय दिलायी. रावलपिंडी में इस श्रृंखला के तीसरे और फाइनल मैच में, द्रविड़ ने अद्वितीय 270 का स्कोर बना कर भारत को पकिस्तान पर एक ऐतिहासिक जीत दिलायी.", "references": ["SL PAK Day 3 - Session 2: Sri Lanka lead by 206 runs.

साबित हुए. उनकी प्रारम्भिक छवि एक रक्षात्मक बल्लेबाज की बन गई थी जिसे केवल टेस्ट क्रिकेट तक ही सीमित होना चाहिए, उन्हें एक दिवसीय अंतरराष्ट्रीय मैचों से हटा दिया गया क्योंकि उनकी रन बनाने की गति बहुत धीमी थी। हालांकि, अपने कैरियर में वे लगातार एकदिवसीय मैचों में रन बनाने लगे, उन्हें वर्ष के आईसीसी खिलाड़ी का पुरस्कार भी मिला। उनका उपनाम 'द वॉल' रिबॉक विज्ञापनों में अब उनकी स्थिरता को ही बताता है। द्रविड़ ने 55.11 के औसत के साथ टेस्ट क्रिकेट में 26 शतक बनाये हैं, जिनमें 5 दोहरे शतक शामिल हैं। एक दिवसीय मैचों में हालांकि उनका औसत 39.49 का रहा है और रन रेट 71.22 की रही है। वे ऐसे कुछ ही भारतीयों में से एक हैं जो घर के बजाय बाहर अधिक औसत बनाते हैं, भारतीय पिच के मुकाबले में विदेशी पिच पर उनका औसत 10 रन अधिक का रहता है। 9 अगस्त 2006 को विदेशी टेस्ट में द्रविड़ का औसत 65.28 रहा जबके उनका कुल औसत 55.4 था। और उनका एकदिवसीय के अलावा औसत 42.03 है जबकि एकदिवसीय का औसत 39.49 है। जिन मैचों में भारत ने जीत हासिल की उनमें द्रविड़ का औसत टेस्ट में 78.72 और एकदिवसीय में 53.40 रहा है। द्रविड़ का एकमात्र टेस्ट विकेट था रिडले जेकब, यह 2001-2002 की श्रृंखला में वेस्ट इंडीज के खिलाफ चौथे टेस्ट के दौरान रहा। द्रविड़ ने कभी गेंदबाजी नहीं की है, पर भारत के लिए एकदिवसीय मैचों में अक्सर विकेट कीपिंग की है। उन्होंने अपने विकेट कीपिंग के दस्तानों को पहले पार्थिव पटेल को सौंपा और हाल ही में महेंद्र सिंह धोनी ने विकेट कीपिंग करना शुरू कर दिया है। द्रविड़ अब पूरी तरह एक बल्लेबाज है, जिन्होंने 1 जनवरी 2000 के बाद से खेले गए मैचों में 63.51 का औसत बनाया है। द्रविड़ एकदिवसीय मैचों में सबसे ज्यादा भागीदारी के दो मैचों में शामिल थे: सौरव गांगुली के साथ 318 रन का साझा, यह पहला जोड़ा था जिसने 300 रन की साझेदारी की और उसके बाद सचिन तेंदुलकर के साथ 331 रन की साझेदारी जो वर्तमान विश्व रिकॉर्ड है। शुरू से लेकर एक डक के लिए आउट होने तक, परियों की सबसे ज्यादा संख्या का रिकॉर्ड भी उनके नाम पर दर्ज है, एकदिवसीय मैचों और टेस्ट मैचों में क्रमशः उनका अधिकतम स्कोर 153 और 270 हैं। अद्वितीय रूप से, टेस्टों में उनका प्रत्येक दोहरा शतक उनके पिछले दोहरे शतकों से अधिक स्कोर रहा। (200*, 217, 222, 233, 270). साथ ही, एक ही कप्तान की कप्तानी के तहत मैचों में रनों के स्कोर के उच्चतम प्रतिशत योगदान का रिकॉर्ड भी द्रविड़ के नाम पर दर्ज है, जिनमें कप्तान ने 20 से अधिक टेस्ट जीते। क्रिकइन्फो- दी मेन फ्राईडेज 21 वें टेस्ट मैच में भारत ने सौरव गांगुली के नेतृत्व में जीत हासिल की। द्रविड़ ने इन जीटोंमें अपनी भूमिका निभाई, उन्होंने 102,84 का रिकॉर्ड औसत बनाया और 2571 रन पूरे किये जिनमें 32 परियों में 9 शतक, तीन दोहरे शतक और 10 अर्द्ध शतक रहे। उन्होंने उन 21 मैचों में भारत के द्वारा बनाये गए कुल रनों में लगभग 23 प्रतिशत का योगदान दिया, जो टीम के द्वारा बनाये गए रनों में से प्रत्येक 4 में से 1 रन है।

में से एक की उपाधि दी गई। हालाँकि मुख्य रूप से एक रक्षात्मक बल्लेबाज द्रविड़ ने 15 नवम्बर 2003 को हैदराबाद में न्यूजीलैण्ड के खिलाफ 22 गेंदों पर नाबाद 50 रन (स्ट्राइक दर-227.27) बनाये, यह भारतीयों में दूसरा सबसे तेज अर्द्ध शतक है। केवल अजित आगरकर इस दृष्टि से द्रविड़ से आगे हैं। उन्होंने केवल 21 गेंदों पर 67 रन बनाये हैं। 2004 में, द्रविड़ को भारत सरकार द्वारा पद्म श्री से सम्मानित किया गया। 7 सितम्बर 2004 को, उन्हें अंतरराष्ट्रीय क्रिकेट परिषद, आईसीसी द्वारा वर्ष के इनाग्रल खिलाडी और वर्ष के टेस्ट खिलाडी का पुरस्कार दिया गया, (इससे सम्बंधित चित्र नीचे दिया गया है।) पिछले वर्ष में द्रविड़ के 95.46 के औसत ने उन्हें एकमात्र भारतीय बना दिया जो वर्ष की टेस्ट टीममें बने रहे। 18 मार्च 2006 को, द्रविड़ ने मुंबई में इंग्लैंड के खिलाफ अपना सौवां टेस्ट खेला। 2005 में,देवेन्द्र प्रभुदेसाई के द्वारा लिखी गई राहुल द्रविड़ की एक जीवनी प्रकाशित हुई, 'दी नाईस गाय हू फिनिश्ड फस्ट' 2005 आईसीसी पुरस्कारों में वे एकमात्र भारतीय थे जिनका नाम वर्ल्ड वन डे इलेवन के लिए दिया गया। 2006 में, यह घोषित किया गया कि वे वेस्ट इंडीज में 2007 के विश्व कप तक भारतीय टीम के कप्तान रहेंगे. हालांकि इंग्लैंड सीरीज के बाद, व्यक्तिगत कारणों की वजह से उन्होंने भारतकी कप्तानी को छोड़ दिया। महेंद्र सिंह धोनी ने वनडे कप्तान के रूप में कमान संभाली. और अनिल कुंबले ने उन्हें टेस्ट मैचों में प्रतिस्थापित किया। 2007 में ऑस्ट्रेलिया के खिलाफ श्रृंखला में खराब प्रदर्शन के कारण उन्हें एकदिवसीय दस्ते से हटा दिया गया। द्रविड़ रणजी ट्रॉफी में कर्नाटक के लिए खेलने के लिए गए और उन्होंने मुंबई के खिलाफ 218 का स्कोर बनाया। 2008 में उन्होंने पर्थ टेस्ट की पहली पारी में, 93 रन बनाये, यह मैच का अधिकतम स्कोर था, इसने भारत को जीतने में और श्रृंखला को 1-2 बनाने में मदद की। हालांकि, उन्हें इसके बाद की एक दिवसीय ट्रिक श्रृंखला के लिए चयनकर्ताओं द्वारा नजरअंदाज कर दिया गया था। 2008 में टेस्ट मैच में एक बेरन रन के बाद द्रविड़ के ऊपर मिडिया का दबाव बहुत अधिक बढ़ गया कि वे या तो रिटायर हो जाएँ या उन्हें हटा दिया जाए. मोहाली में इंग्लैंड के खिलाफ दूसरे टेस्ट में उन्होंने 136 का स्कोर बनाया और गौतम गंभीरके साथ एक तिहरा शतक लगाया. टेस्ट मैचों में 10000 रन पूरे कर लेने के बाद, उन्होंने कहा कि \"यह सुनिश्चितता के लिए गर्व का क्षण है। मेरे लिए, आगे बढ़ते हुए, मैंने भारत के लिए खेलने का सपना देखा.जब मैं पीछे देखता हूँ, संभवतया मैंने अपनी उम्मीदों से ज्यादा कर दिखाया है, जैसा कि मैंने पिछले 10-12 सालों के दौरान प्रदर्शन किया है। मैंने ऐसा करने की महत्वाकांक्षा कभी नहीं रखी क्योंकि-यह खेल में मेरी दीर्घायु का केवल एक प्रतिबिम्ब है।", "references": [" Dravid is hugged by Sourav Ganguly after reaching the milestone India's Rahul Dravid became only the sixth batsman in history to score 10,000 Test runs as the first Test against South Africa headed for a draw. The 35-year-old former captain reached the milestone on his way to making 111 for his 25th Test century in Chennai. Virender Sehwag earlier departed for 319, adding only 10 to his overnight score, as India were all out for 627. Dale Steyn took 4-103 before Neil McKenzie and Hashim Amla took South Africa to 131-1, a lead of 44. The Proteas pair batted cautiously, with India's spinners Harbhajan Singh and Anil Kumble finding increasing turn on the worn pitch. One such delivery saw Harbhajan end an aggressive knock from South Africa skipper Graeme Smith. The opener was adjudged lbw to one that turned in at him off a length after hitting 35 from 30 balls, including five fours. 606: DEBATE Dravid is truly one of the batting greats SwingBowler McKenzie brought up his second half century of the match to end the day unbeaten on 59, with first-innings centurion Amla 35 not out. India resumed 72 runs short of the tourists' first-innings total of 540 with nine wickets in hand and the focus quickly shifted to Dravid after Sehwag got a thick outside edge to a Makhaya Ntini delivery which flew straight to McKenzie at first slip. Although Sehwag fell well short of Brian Lara's world record of 400 not out, it was the 15th-highest score in Test cricket, the best ever in India and a personal career best. Sachin Tendulkar replaced Sehwag, but his innings was an anti-climax, lasting just five deliveries before he was caught by Jacques Kallis off Makhaya Ntini for a duck. McKenzie and Amla batted out the evening session in Chennai Tendulkar was replaced by Sourav Ganguly, who stayed long enough to see Dravid pass 10,000 runs, thereby becoming the third Indian to join the exclusive group, following current team-mate Sachin Tendulkar and former captain Sunil Gavaskar. Lara is Test cricket's leading scorer with 11,953 runs, while Australians Allan Border and Steve Waugh make up the six. Dravid went on to reach his 25th Test century off 272 balls, and after losing Ganguly to the spin of Paul Harris for 24, he was finally out when he edged Ntini to Kallis in the slips, having struck 15 boundaries in his six and a half hour knock. Steyn then showed why he is the most talked-about young fast bowler in international cricket by having Mahendra Dhoni caught behind for 16 and bowling Anil Kumble, Harbhajan Singh and RP Singh as India declined from 598-5 to 612-9. But he was denied a five-wicket haul when left-armer Harris claimed further reward for 53 overs of hard toil when he accepted a return catch from VVS Laxman (39) to finish with figures of 3-203. India batsman Rahul Dravid: \"It's a proud moment for sure. For me, growing up, I dreamt of playing for India.

India's Rahul Dravid became only the sixth batsman in history to score 10,000 Test runs as the first Test against South Africa headed for a draw. The 35-year-old former captain reached the milestone on his way to making 111 for his 25th Test century in Chennai. Virender Sehwag earlier departed for 319, adding only 10 to his overnight score, as India were all out for 627. Dale Steyn took 4-103 before Neil McKenzie and Hashim Amla took South Africa to 131-1, a lead of 44. The Proteas pair batted cautiously, with India's spinners Harbhajan Singh and Anil Kumble finding increasing turn on the worn pitch. One such delivery saw Harbhajan end an aggressive knock from South Africa skipper Graeme Smith. The opener was adjudged lbw to one that turned in at him off a length after hitting 35 from 30 balls, including five fours. 606: DEBATE Dravid is truly one of the batting greats SwingBowler McKenzie brought up his second half century of the match to end the day unbeaten on 59, with first-innings centurion Amla 35 not out. India resumed 72 runs short of the tourists' first-innings total of 540 with nine wickets in hand and the focus quickly shifted to Dravid after Sehwag got a thick outside edge to a Makhaya Ntini delivery which flew straight to McKenzie at first slip. Although Sehwag fell well short of Brian Lara's world record of 400 not out, it was the 15th-highest score in Test cricket, the best ever in India and a personal career best. Sachin Tendulkar replaced Sehwag, but his innings was an anti-climax, lasting just five deliveries before he was caught by Jacques Kallis off Makhaya Ntini for a duck. McKenzie and Amla batted out the evening session in Chennai Tendulkar was replaced by Sourav Ganguly, who stayed long enough to see Dravid pass 10,000 runs, thereby becoming the third Indian to join the exclusive group, following current team-mate Sachin Tendulkar and former captain Sunil Gavaskar. Lara is Test cricket's leading scorer with 11,953 runs, while Australians Allan Border and Steve Waugh make up the six. Dravid went on to reach his 25th Test century off 272 balls, and after losing Ganguly to the spin of Paul Harris for 24, he was finally out when he edged Ntini to Kallis in the slips, having struck 15 boundaries in his six and a half hour knock. Steyn then showed why he is the most talked-about young fast bowler in international cricket by having Mahendra Dhoni caught behind for 16 and bowling Anil Kumble, Harbhajan Singh and RP Singh as India declined from 598-5 to 612-9. But he was denied a five-wicket haul when left-armer Harris claimed further reward for 53 overs of hard toil when he accepted a return catch from VVS Laxman (39) to finish with figures of 3-203.

McKenzie brought up his second half century of the match to end the day unbeaten on 59, with first-innings centurion Amla 35 not out. India resumed 72 runs short of the tourists' first-innings total of 540 with nine wickets in hand and the focus quickly shifted to Dravid after Sehwag got a thick outside edge to a Makhaya Ntini delivery which flew straight to McKenzie at first slip. Although Sehwag fell well short of Brian Lara's world record of 400 not out, it was the 15th-highest score in Test cricket, the best ever in India and a personal career best. Sachin Tendulkar replaced Sehwag, but his innings was an anti-climax, lasting just five deliveries before he was caught by Jacques Kallis off Makhaya Ntini for a duck. McKenzie and Amla batted out the evening session in Chennai Tendulkar was replaced by Sourav Ganguly, who stayed long enough to see Dravid pass 10,000 runs, thereby becoming the third Indian to join the exclusive group, following current team-mate Sachin Tendulkar and former captain Sunil Gavaskar.

Dravid went on to reach his 25th Test century off 272 balls, and after losing Ganguly to the spin of Paul Harris for 24, he was finally out when he edged Ntini to Kallis in the slips, having struck 15 boundaries in his six and a half hour knock. Steyn then showed why he is the most talked-about young fast bowler in international cricket by having Mahendra Dhoni caught behind for 16 and bowling Anil Kumble, Harbhajan Singh and RP Singh as India declined from 598-5 to 612-9.

The 35-year-old former captain reached the milestone on his way to making 111 for his 25th Test century in Chennai. Virender Sehwag earlier departed for 319, adding only 10 to his overnight score, as India were all out for 627. Dale Steyn took 4-103 before Neil McKenzie and Hashim Amla took South Africa to 131-1, a lead of 44. The Proteas pair batted cautiously, with India's spinners Harbhajan Singh and Anil Kumble finding increasing turn on the worn pitch. One such delivery saw Harbhajan end an aggressive knock from South Africa skipper Graeme Smith. The opener was adjudged lbw to one that turned in at him off a length after hitting 35 from 30 balls, including five fours. 606: DEBATE Dravid is truly one of the batting greats SwingBowler McKenzie brought up his second half century of the match to end the day unbeaten on 59, with first-innings centurion Amla 35 not out. India resumed 72 runs short of the tourists' first-innings total of 540 with nine wickets in hand and the focus quickly shifted to Dravid after Sehwag got a thick outside edge to a Makhaya Ntini delivery which flew straight to McKenzie at first slip. Although Sehwag fell well short of Brian Lara's world record of 400 not out, it was the 15th-highest score in Test cricket, the best ever in India and a personal career best. Sachin Tendulkar replaced Sehwag, but his innings was an anti-climax, lasting just five deliveries before he was caught by Jacques Kallis off Makhaya Ntini for a duck.

Lara is Test cricket's leading scorer with 11,953 runs, while Australians Allan Border and Steve Waugh make up the six. Dravid went on to reach his 25th Test century off 272 balls, and after losing Ganguly to the spin of Paul Harris for 24, he was finally out when he edged Ntini to Kallis in the slips, having struck 15 boundaries in his six and a half hour knock. Steyn then showed why he is the most talked-about young fast bowler in international cricket by having Mahendra Dhoni caught behind for 16 and bowling Anil Kumble, Harbhajan Singh and RP Singh as India declined from 598-5 to 612-9.

India's Rahul Dravid became only the sixth batsman in history to score 10,000 Test runs as the first Test against South Africa headed for a draw. The 35-year-old former captain reached the milestone on his way to making 111 for his 25th Test century in Chennai. Virender Sehwag earlier departed for 319, adding only 10 to his overnight score, as India were all out for 627.

The Proteas pair batted cautiously, with India's spinners Harbhajan Singh and Anil Kumble finding increasing turn on the worn pitch.

Although Sehwag fell well short of Brian Lara's world record of 400 not out, it was the 15th-highest score in Test cricket, the best ever in India and a personal career best.

McKenzie brought up his second half century of the match to end the day unbeaten on 59, with first-innings centurion Amla 35 not out. India resumed 72 runs short of the tourists' first-innings total of 540 with nine wickets in hand and the focus quickly shifted to Dravid after Sehwag got a thick outside edge to a Makhaya Ntini delivery which flew straight to McKenzie at first slip. Although Sehwag fell well short of Brian Lara's world record of 400 not out, it was the 15th-highest score in Test cricket, the best ever in India and a personal career best. Sachin Tendulkar replaced Sehwag, but his innings was an anti-climax, lasting just five deliveries before he was caught by Jacques Kallis off Makhaya Ntini for a duck. McKenzie and Amla batted out the evening session in Chennai Tendulkar was replaced by Sourav Ganguly, who stayed long enough to see Dravid pass 10,000 runs, thereby becoming the third Indian to join the exclusive group, following current team-mate Sachin Tendulkar and former captain Sunil Gavaskar.

Indian cricket captain Sourav Ganguly has conceded that the declaration in the Multan Test against Pakistan with Sachin Tendulkar on 194 was a ``mistake''. ``We made a mistake in this matter but we need to look ahead now. Indian cricket is moving forward and let us stay focussed in that direction than looking back and creating needless problems,'' Ganguly said in an interview to The Sportstar. The Indian captain, who did not play in the Multan Test because of an injury, also made it clear that the declaration issue was a closed chapter and said as far as he was concerned it was a ``non-issue''. ``Much has been said and written on this subject and not all of it was accurate or in good taste. The media and some people need an issue to talk but as far as I am concerned it was a non-issue. ``In the Sydney Test we declared with Rahul (Dravid) in the 90's. As far as I am concerned this incident of Multan is a chapter closed. We are all mature people and know that sometimes we all make mistakes.'' Ganguly also said that Yuvraj Singh is the opener for the future for India and he had spoken to him in this regard. ``Let me make one thing clear: Yuvraj is the opener for the future. I have spoken to him in this regard. He is too good a batsman to sit out and we have backed him ahead of S. Ramesh for precisely this reason.'' The Indian captain said Akash Chopra had a lot of potential but he needed to bat more positively and convert the good starts into big scores. ``He bats with patience and that is his game. Nothing wrong with it but for his own good he has to change his style... I know he plays the tough part well by taking on the new-ball bowlers but he needs to build on those starts with substantial scores.'' Asked what he felt made the present team different from the past sides, he said: ``we have some exceptionally talented players and we have managed to groom them. The commitment level is high and work ethics are there for you to see... the support group has played its role in the improvement and I must say the role played by (coach) John Wright has been outstanding.'' Ganguly also said that seniors in the team had made his job easy although he did have some problems with now retired medium pacer Javagal Srinath. ``The seniors have made my job easy. I had a few problems with Srinath. He had his own views on certain aspects of our approach but then his intentions were always to serve the team better. Believe me, the seniors in the team have been my strength.'' — PTI Printer friendly page Send this article to Friends by E-Mail Sport News: Front Page | National | Tamil Nadu | Andhra Pradesh | Karnataka | Kerala | New Delhi | Other States | International | Opinion | Business | Sport | Miscellaneous | Advts: Classifieds | Employment | Obituary | Updates: Breaking News | NEW DELHI, APRIL 29.

The Indian captain, who did not play in the Multan Test because of an injury, also made it clear that the declaration issue was a closed chapter and said as far as he was concerned it was a ``non-issue''. ``Much has been said and written on this subject and not all of it was accurate or in good taste. The media and some people need an issue to talk but as far as I am concerned it was a non-issue. ``In the Sydney Test we declared with Rahul (Dravid) in the 90's. As far as I am concerned this incident of Multan is a chapter closed. We are all mature people and know that sometimes we all make mistakes.'' Ganguly also said that Yuvraj Singh is the opener for the future for India and he had spoken to him in this regard. ``Let me make one thing clear: Yuvraj is the opener for the future. I have spoken to him in this regard. He is too good a batsman to sit out and we have backed him ahead of S. Ramesh for precisely this reason.'' The Indian captain said Akash Chopra had a lot of potential but he needed to bat more positively and convert the good starts into big scores. ``He bats with patience and that is his game. Nothing wrong with it but for his own good he has to change his style... I know he plays the tough part well by taking on the new-ball bowlers but he needs to build on those starts with substantial scores.'' Asked what he felt made the present team different from the past sides, he said: ``we have some exceptionally talented players and we have managed to groom them. The commitment level is high and work ethics are there for you to see... the support group has played its role in the improvement and I must say the role played by (coach) John Wright has been outstanding.'' Ganguly also said that seniors in the team had made his job easy although he did have some problems with now retired medium pacer Javagal Srinath. ``The seniors have made my job easy. I had a few problems with Srinath. He had his own views on certain aspects of our approach but then his intentions were always to serve the team better. Believe me, the seniors in the team have been my strength.'' — PTI Printer friendly page Send this article to Friends by E-Mail Sport News: Front Page | National | Tamil Nadu | Andhra Pradesh | Karnataka | Kerala | New Delhi | Other States | International | Opinion | Business | Sport | Miscellaneous | Advts: Classifieds | Employment | Obituary | Updates: Breaking News | ``We made a mistake in this matter but we need to look ahead now.

However, he stressed that the result could still have been a better one had the top-order batsmen done their job.\"Yes, in hindsight when you look at the result of the game definitely I would have changed the decision I made right upfront,\" he stated. Clarifying the reasons for the move, he said: \"We'd taken five bowlers, and we had three seamers, and we thought there'd be a bit more bounce and seam movement early. We thought we could get a few wickets there, restrict them to a low score, and then bat big in the first innings to set the game up. It didn't do as much as we expected in the first session, they batted well, and once they'd got 270 for 3 on the first day we knew we were on the back foot.\"Dravid refused to accept, though, that the decision at the toss was the major reason for the defeat. \"Obviously the decision to bowl wasn't the right one, but having said that we could have lost the toss and we would have fielded in any case. We could have played much better cricket, especially our batting in both innings, I think the top-order batting has let us down right through the series. We did well to recover to 279, but then again in the second innings I don't think this was a 100-all-out wicket.\"Going into the final day, Dravid indicated that he was satisfied with the position India were in. \"I was very happy with the way we bowled yesterday. Our bowlers did a great job to restrict them and I was very happy with the situation as it was in the morning. I thought if we could get to lunch and to tea with wickets in hand, we could really have a crack at the target in the last session. It's not easy to chase 300 in the last innings especially in India when the ball is turning and a bit of reverse-swing happening. I think we did ok till lunch. Then losing those two wickets in the first two overs after lunch was really the killer blow.\"After Dravid's and Tendulkar's dismissal, the rest of the Indian batting caved in a shockingly spineless display. Dravid attributed that to \"wrong options under pressure\". \"Some of the shots we played weren't up to mark, but when you're put under pressure that can happen sometimes.\"Expectedly, the move to go into the game with five bowlers came in for comment, but Dravid stressed the need to move in that direction, especially if the aim was to start winning outside India. \"We feel that going ahead and looking at some of our results in away series, five bowlers is quite important to our combination. You can argue that if we had only four bowlers we might have given more runs in the first innings, or we wouldn't have been able to bowl as well as we did in the second. We do weigh the pros and cons of six batsmen, but if we want to win a series abroad and if we want to be competitive as a team as England have shown in the Ashes and even here, then we do need five bowlers.\"Along with top-order batting, the other area of serious concern for India was their catching: of the 16 chances missed in the game, ten were from Indian fielders, and Dravid admitted that the performance in the field was a let-down. \"The situation would have been quite different had we held our catches. We're working on it. With a few changes in our combinations, some of the fielders in specialist positions have moved out and the boys not fielding in specialist positions have to work on it. We have five batsmen, so all of them should be good catchers; we can't expect bowlers to be catching in the slips.\"The big finds of the series were Munaf Patel, who took 10 wickets at 21.70, and Sreesanth (nine at 25.66). Dravid had a word of praise for them, and also for Anil Kumble and Wasim Jaffer. \"Our bowlers - Munaf and Sreesanth - came good for us. They showed good spirit and it's a good sign for the future. A group of three-four bowlers are bowling with good pace, in good areas, showing good attitude. So that's one of the pluses in the series. Anil bowled brilliantly and batted well too, while Wasim looked composed as an opener.\"Finally, he was all praise for Andrew Flintoff, England's captain and Man of the Series. \"He was phenomenal and truly deserved the Man-of-the-Series award. Every time he went out, he scored runs, was their best bowler on view right through the series and kept coming hard. I think he did a great job as a captain in his first series and he's truly shown why is the greatest allrounder in the world at the moment.\"Rahul DravidIndia vs EnglandEngland tour of IndiaS Rajesh is stats editor of Cricinfo Matches (11) Matches (11) (11) SL v PAK (1) SL v PAK (1) (1) SA-W in ENG (1) SA-W in ENG (1) (1) County DIV1 (5) County DIV1 (5) (5) County DIV2 (3) County DIV2 (3) (3) TNPL (1) TNPL (1) (1) Live • 2nd TEST • Galle • 2nd TEST (15.1 ov) & Day 3 - Session 2: Sri Lanka lead by 206 runs.

However, he stressed that the result could still have been a better one had the top-order batsmen done their job. \"Yes, in hindsight when you look at the result of the game definitely I would have changed the decision I made right upfront,\" he stated. Clarifying the reasons for the move, he said: \"We'd taken five bowlers, and we had three seamers, and we thought there'd be a bit more bounce and seam movement early. We thought we could get a few wickets there, restrict them to a low score, and then bat big in the first innings to set the game up. It didn't do as much as we expected in the first session, they batted well, and once they'd got 270 for 3 on the first day we knew we were on the back foot.\" Dravid refused to accept, though, that the decision at the toss was the major reason for the defeat. \"Obviously the decision to bowl wasn't the right one, but having said that we could have lost the toss and we would have fielded in any case. We could have played much better cricket, especially our batting in both innings, I think the top-order batting has let us down right through the series. We did well to recover to 279, but then again in the second innings I don't think this was a 100-all-out wicket.\" Going into the final day, Dravid indicated that he was satisfied with the position India were in. \"I was very happy with the way we bowled yesterday. Our bowlers did a great job to restrict them and I was very happy with the situation as it was in the morning. I thought if we could get to lunch and to tea with wickets in hand, we could really have a crack at the target in the last session. It's not easy to chase 300 in the last innings especially in India when the ball is turning and a bit of reverse-swing happening. I think we did ok till lunch. Then losing those two wickets in the first two overs after lunch was really the killer blow.\" After Dravid's and Tendulkar's dismissal, the rest of the Indian batting caved in a shockingly spineless display. Dravid attributed that to \"wrong options under pressure\". \"Some of the shots we played weren't up to mark, but when you're put under pressure that can happen sometimes.\" Expectedly, the move to go into the game with five bowlers came in for comment, but Dravid stressed the need to move in that direction, especially if the aim was to start winning outside India. \"We feel that going ahead and looking at some of our results in away series, five bowlers is quite important to our combination. You can argue that if we had only four bowlers we might have given more runs in the first innings, or we wouldn't have been able to bowl as well as we did in the second. We do weigh the pros and cons of six batsmen, but if we want to win a series abroad and if we want to be competitive as a team as England have shown in the Ashes and even here, then we do need five bowlers.\" Along with top-order batting, the other area of serious concern for India was their catching: of the 16 chances missed in the game, ten were from Indian fielders, and Dravid admitted that the performance in the field was a let-down. \"The situation would have been quite different had we held our catches. We're working on it. With a few changes in our combinations, some of the fielders in specialist positions have moved out and the boys not fielding in specialist positions have to work on it. We have five batsmen, so all of them should be good catchers; we can't expect bowlers to be catching in the slips.\" The big finds of the series were Munaf Patel, who took 10 wickets at 21.70, and Sreesanth (nine at 25.66). Dravid had a word of praise for them, and also for Anil Kumble and Wasim Jaffer. \"Our bowlers - Munaf and Sreesanth - came good for us. They showed good spirit and it's a good sign for the future. A group of three-four bowlers are bowling with good pace, in good areas, showing good attitude. So that's one of the pluses in the series. Anil bowled brilliantly and batted well too, while Wasim looked composed as an opener.\" Finally, he was all praise for Andrew Flintoff, England's captain and Man of the Series. \"He was phenomenal and truly deserved the Man-of-the-Series award. Every time he went out, he scored runs, was their best bowler on view right through the series and kept coming hard. I think he did a great job as a captain in his first series and he's truly shown why is the greatest allrounder in the world at the moment.\" Rahul Dravid India vs England England tour of India Terms of Use • Terms of Use Terms of Use • Privacy Policy • Privacy Policy Privacy Policy • Interest-Based Ads • Interest-Based Ads Interest-Based Ads • Addendum to the Global Privacy Policy • Addendum to the Global Privacy Policy Addendum to the Global Privacy Policy • Feedback Feedback Feedback", "India v England, 3rd Test, Mumbai, 5th day Dravid regrets top-order failiure S Rajesh in Mumbai March 22, 2006 Rahul Dravid's 100th Test turned out to be a bitterly disappointing one © Getty Images Rahul Dravid's 100th Test turned out to be a bitterly disappointing one, and at the post-match press conference, the captain admitted that his decision to field first at Mumbai was a mistake.

He should decide who should bat at No. 3 and not the coach,'' he was quoted as saying by the Gulf News on Sunday. He said Dravid should be allowed to field an eleven of his choice. ``Dravid should stand up and say that he is the boss and that he controls matters once he crosses the boundary line. He should get an eleven of his choice,'' he said. Shastri also slammed Chappell's experiments with the batting orders of Virender Sehwag and Dravid, which he said put paid to India's chances in the tri-series. ``It's time Chappell stopped his experiments . I cannot understand how he could send Sehwag at No. 4. I will always prefer Sehwag as an opener. If he gets going even three out of 10 times, it would bring victory ,'' he said. — PTI Printer friendly page Send this article to Friends by E-Mail Sport News: ePaper | Front Page | National | Tamil Nadu | Andhra Pradesh | Karnataka | Kerala | New Delhi | Other States | International | Opinion | Business | Sport | Miscellaneous | Engagements | Advts: Classifieds | Jobs | Obituary | Updates: Breaking News | Sport - Cricket Shastri criticises Dravid Dubai: Indian skipper Rahul Dravid has come under flak from former all-rounder Ravi Shastri who said it was time he asserted himself and called the shots instead of coach Greg Chappell. ``It's time Dravid exerted himself and told Chappell that in future he will call the shots,'' Shastri said in the wake of India's debacle in the cricket tri-series in Malaysia. ``A coach must only help the captain but the final decision must rest with Dravid.

राहुल द्रविड़ मात्र दूसरे भारतीय हैं जिन्होंने एक विश्व कप में उच्चतम रन बनाये हैं। (पहले सचिन तेंडुलकर हैं - दो बार - 1996, 2003) उन्होंने अपने पहले विश्व कप, 1999 के विश्व कप में 461 रन बनाये। राहुल द्रविड़ ने 2006 में वेस्ट इंडीज में उन्हीं के खिलाफ टेस्ट श्रृंखला में ऐतिहासिक जीत दर्ज की। 1971 के बाद से, भारत ने वेस्ट इंडीज में कभी भी कोई टेस्ट श्रृंखला नहीं जीती। 1986 के बाद से यह उनकी पहली प्रमुख श्रृंखला रही, (2005 में जिम्बाब्वे के खिलाफ जीत) जो भारतीय उप महाद्वीप के बाहर विजयी हुई। द्रविड़ की कप्तानी में भारतीय टीम ने सर्वोच्च एकदिवसीय अंतर्राष्ट्रीय क्रमागत जीतों के पिछले रिकॉर्ड को बनाये रखा, जिसमें भारतीय टीम ने 2003 में सौरव गांगुली की कप्तानी में लगातार (8) विजयें हासिल की थीं। बाद में महेंद्र सिंह धोनी के नेतृत्व में भारतीय टीम ने 2008-2009 में लगातार 9 बार जीत हासिल करके इस रिकॉर्ड को बेहतर बनाया। उनकी कप्तानी के दौरान भारतीय टीम ने वेस्ट इंडीज के लगातार 14 एक दिवसीय अंतरराष्ट्रीय मैचों में जीत के रिकॉर्ड को तोडॉ॰ इन 17 मैचों की जीत में द्रविड़ 15 के कप्तान रहे जबकि शेष 2 की कप्तानी सौरव गांगुली ने संभाली. इस लकीर को 20 मई 2006 को तोड़ दिया गया जब भारत सबीना पार्क, जमाइका में 1 रन से वेस्ट इंडीज से हार गया। राहुल द्रविड़ पहले कप्तान हैं जिनके नेतृत्व में भारत ने दक्षिण अफ्रीका को दक्षिण अफ्रीका की धरती पर टेस्ट मैच में हरा दिया। वे भारत से तीसरे कप्तान थे जिन्होंने इंग्लेंड में टेस्ट श्रृंखला जीती। यह उपलब्धि 21 साल के बाद हासिल हुई। दो अन्य कप्तान कपिल देव(1986) और अजीत वाडेकर (1971) है। उन्होंने टेस्ट और एक दिवसीय अंतरराष्ट्रीय दोनों में 10,000 रन बनाये हैं, तेंडुलकर और लारा के बाद वे इस उपलब्धि को हासिल करने वाले तीसरे बल्लेबाज हैं। पोंटिंग एकमात्र अन्य व्यक्ति हैं जिन्होंने यह कर दिखाया है। वे एक गैर विकेट कीपर के द्वारा टेस्ट क्रिकेट में अधिकतम कैच का रिकॉर्ड भी रखते हैं। आलोचना उन्होंने मार्च 2004 में जो फैसला लिया, उस पर सबसे ज्यादा बहस हुई, जब वे घायल कप्तान सौरव गांगुली की भूमिका निभा रहे थे। भारत की पहली पारी को एक बिंदु पर घोषित कर दिया गया जब सचिन तेंडुलकर दूसरे दिन 16 ओवर पर 194 पर थे। राहुल द्रविड़ ने टेस्टों में भारत का नेतृत्व करते हुए एक मिश्रित रिकॉर्ड बनाया। भारत 2006 में कराची टेस्ट हार गया, पाकिस्तान इस श्रृंखला को 1-0 से जीता। मार्च 2006 में, भारत मुंबई टेस्ट हार गया, 1985 के बाद से पहली बार इंग्लैंड भारत में टेस्ट जीता। फ्लिन्तोफ़ की क्षमता ने इस श्रृंखला में 1-1 से जीत दर्ज करायी. हालांकि कराची में हार का कारण यह माना गया की कई भारतीय बल्लेबाजों ने बुरा प्रदर्शन किया, लेकिन मुंबई की हार को द्रविड़ के इस गलत फैसले का नतीजा माना गया कि एक फ्लैट सूखी पिच पर पहले गेंदबाजी की जाए. जिससे बाद में स्थिति बिगड़ गई और भारतीयों को रन लेने में बहुत परेशानी हुई। इंडियन प्रीमियर लीग में 2008 के खेल के बाद जब बंगलौर रॉयल चेलेंजर्स 8 में से सातवें स्थान पर आई तो विजय माल्या ने उनकी आलोचना की कि उन्होंने टीम में सही संतुलन नहीं बनाया है। जब भारत डीएलएफ कप के फाइनल में नहीं पहुँच पाया, तो पूर्व आल-राउंडर रवि शास्त्री ने भारतीय स्कीपर राहुल द्रविड़ की आलोचना की, कि यह पर्याप्त धनात्मक नहीं है और ग्रेग चैपल को बहुत से फैसले लेने होंगे। जब उनसे प्रतिक्रिया की उम्मीद की गई तो द्रविड़ ने कहा कि शास्त्री, एक

Indian cricket captain Sourav Ganguly has conceded that the declaration in the Multan Test against Pakistan with Sachin Tendulkar on 194 was a ``mistake''. ``We made a mistake in this matter but we need to look ahead now. Indian cricket is moving forward and let us stay focussed in that direction than looking back and creating needless problems,'' Ganguly said in an interview to The Sportstar. The Indian captain, who did not play in the Multan Test because of an injury, also made it clear that the declaration issue was a closed chapter and said as far as he was concerned it was a ``non-issue''. ``Much has been said and written on this subject and not all of it was accurate or in good taste. The media and some people need an issue to talk but as far as I am concerned it was a non-issue. ``In the Sydney Test we declared with Rahul (Dravid) in the 90's. As far as I am concerned this incident of Multan is a chapter closed. We are all mature people and know that sometimes we all make mistakes.'' Ganguly also said that Yuvraj Singh is the opener for the future for India and he had spoken to him in this regard. ``Let me make one thing clear: Yuvraj is the opener for the future. I have spoken to him in this regard. He is too good a batsman to sit out and we have backed him ahead of S. Ramesh for precisely this reason.'' The Indian captain said Akash Chopra had a lot of potential but he needed to bat more positively and convert the good starts into big scores. ``He bats with patience and that is his game. Nothing wrong with it but for his own good he has to change his style... I know he plays the tough part well by taking on the new-ball bowlers but he needs to build on those starts with substantial scores.'' Asked what he felt made the present team different from the past sides, he said: ``we have some exceptionally talented players and we have managed to groom them. The commitment level is high and work ethics are there for you to see... the support group has played its role in the improvement and I must say the role played by (coach) John Wright has been outstanding.'' Ganguly also said that seniors in the team had made his job easy although he did have some problems with now retired medium pacer Javagal Srinath. ``The seniors have made my job easy. I had a few problems with Srinath. He had his own views on certain aspects of our approach but then his intentions were always to serve the team better.

However, he stressed that the result could still have been a better one had the top-order batsmen done their job.\"Yes, in hindsight when you look at the result of the game definitely I would have changed the decision I made right upfront,\" he stated. Clarifying the reasons for the move, he said: \"We'd taken five bowlers, and we had three seamers, and we thought there'd be a bit more bounce and seam movement early. We thought we could get a few wickets there, restrict them to a low score, and then bat big in the first innings to set the game up. It didn't do as much as we expected in the first session, they batted well, and once they'd got 270 for 3 on the first day we knew we were on the back foot.\"Dravid refused to accept, though, that the decision at the toss was the major reason for the defeat. \"Obviously the decision to bowl wasn't the right one, but having said that we could have lost the toss and we would have fielded in any case. We could have played much better cricket, especially our batting in both innings, I think the top-order batting has let us down right through the series. We did well to recover to 279, but then again in the second innings I don't think this was a 100-all-out wicket.\"Going into the final day, Dravid indicated that he was satisfied with the position India were in. \"I was very happy with the way we bowled yesterday. Our bowlers did a great job to restrict them and I was very happy with the situation as it was in the morning. I thought if we could get to lunch and to tea with wickets in hand, we could really have a crack at the target in the last session. It's not easy to chase 300 in the last innings especially in India when the ball is turning and a bit of reverse-swing happening. I think we did ok till lunch. Then losing those two wickets in the first two overs after lunch was really the killer blow.\"After Dravid's and Tendulkar's dismissal, the rest of the Indian batting caved in a shockingly spineless display. Dravid attributed that to \"wrong options under pressure\". \"Some of the shots we played weren't up to mark, but when you're put under pressure that can happen sometimes.\"Expectedly, the move to go into the game with five bowlers came in for comment, but Dravid stressed the need to move in that direction, especially if the aim was to start winning outside India. \"We feel that going ahead and looking at some of our results in away series, five bowlers is quite important to our combination. You can argue that if we had only four bowlers we might have given more runs in the first innings, or we wouldn't have been able to bowl as well as we did in the second. We do weigh the pros and cons of six batsmen, but if we want to win a series abroad and if we want to be competitive as a team as England have shown in the Ashes and even here, then we do need five bowlers.\"Along with top-order batting, the other area of serious concern for India was their catching: of the 16 chances missed in the game, ten were from Indian fielders, and Dravid admitted that the performance in the field was a let-down. \"The situation would have been quite different had we held our catches. We're working on it. With a few changes in our combinations, some of the fielders in specialist positions have moved out and the boys not fielding in specialist positions have to work on it. We have five batsmen, so all of them should be good catchers; we can't expect bowlers to be catching in the slips.\"The big finds of the series were Munaf Patel, who took 10 wickets at 21.70, and Sreesanth (nine at 25.66). Dravid had a word of praise for them, and also for Anil Kumble and Wasim Jaffer. \"Our bowlers - Munaf and Sreesanth - came good for us. They showed good spirit and it's a good sign for the future. A group of three-four bowlers are bowling with good pace, in good areas, showing good attitude. So that's one of the pluses in the series. Anil bowled brilliantly and batted well too, while Wasim looked composed as an opener.\"Finally, he was all praise for Andrew Flintoff, England's captain and Man of the Series. \"He was phenomenal and truly deserved the Man-of-the-Series award. Every time he went out, he scored runs, was their best bowler on view right through the series and kept coming hard. I think he did a great job as a captain in his first series and he's truly shown why is the greatest allrounder in the world at the moment.\"Rahul DravidIndia vs EnglandEngland tour of IndiaS Rajesh is stats editor of Cricinfo Matches (11) Matches (11) (11) SL v PAK (1) SL v PAK (1) (1) SA-W in ENG (1) SA-W in ENG (1) (1) County DIV1 (5) County DIV1 (5) (5) County DIV2 (3) County DIV2 (3) (3) TNPL (1) TNPL (1) (1) Live • 2nd TEST • Galle • 2nd TEST (15.1 ov) & Day 3 - Session 2: Sri Lanka lead by 206 runs.

However, he stressed that the result could still have been a better one had the top-order batsmen done their job. \"Yes, in hindsight when you look at the result of the game definitely I would have changed the decision I made right upfront,\" he stated. Clarifying the reasons for the move, he said: \"We'd taken five bowlers, and we had three seamers, and we thought there'd be a bit more bounce and seam movement early. We thought we could get a few wickets there, restrict them to a low score, and then bat big in the first innings to set the game up. It didn't do as much as we expected in the first session, they batted well, and once they'd got 270 for 3 on the first day we knew we were on the back foot.\" Dravid refused to accept, though, that the decision at the toss was the major reason for the defeat. \"Obviously the decision to bowl wasn't the right one, but having said that we could have lost the toss and we would have fielded in any case. We could have played much better cricket, especially our batting in both innings, I think the top-order batting has let us down right through the series. We did well to recover to 279, but then again in the second innings I don't think this was a 100-all-out wicket.\" Going into the final day, Dravid indicated that he was satisfied with the position India were in. \"I was very happy with the way we bowled yesterday. Our bowlers did a great job to restrict them and I was very happy with the situation as it was in the morning. I thought if we could get to lunch and to tea with wickets in hand, we could really have a crack at the target in the last session. It's not easy to chase 300 in the last innings especially in India when the ball is turning and a bit of reverse-swing happening. I think we did ok till lunch. Then losing those two wickets in the first two overs after lunch was really the killer blow.\" After Dravid's and Tendulkar's dismissal, the rest of the Indian batting caved in a shockingly spineless display. Dravid attributed that to \"wrong options under pressure\". \"Some of the shots we played weren't up to mark, but when you're put under pressure that can happen sometimes.\" Expectedly, the move to go into the game with five bowlers came in for comment, but Dravid stressed the need to move in that direction, especially if the aim was to start winning outside India. \"We feel that going ahead and looking at some of our results in away series, five bowlers is quite important to our combination. You can argue that if we had only four bowlers we might have given more runs in the first innings, or we wouldn't have been able to bowl as well as we did in the second. We do weigh the pros and cons of six batsmen, but if we want to win a series abroad and if we want to be competitive as a team as England have shown in the Ashes and even here, then we do need five bowlers.\" Along with top-order batting, the other area of serious concern for India was their catching: of the 16 chances missed in the game, ten were from Indian fielders, and Dravid admitted that the performance in the field was a let-down. \"The situation would have been quite different had we held our catches. We're working on it. With a few changes in our combinations, some of the fielders in specialist positions have moved out and the boys not fielding in specialist positions have to work on it. We have five batsmen, so all of them should be good catchers; we can't expect bowlers to be catching in the slips.\" The big finds of the series were Munaf Patel, who took 10 wickets at 21.70, and Sreesanth (nine at 25.66). Dravid had a word of praise for them, and also for Anil Kumble and Wasim Jaffer. \"Our bowlers - Munaf and Sreesanth - came good for us. They showed good spirit and it's a good sign for the future. A group of three-four bowlers are bowling with good pace, in good areas, showing good attitude. So that's one of the pluses in the series. Anil bowled brilliantly and batted well too, while Wasim looked composed as an opener.\" Finally, he was all praise for Andrew Flintoff, England's captain and Man of the Series. \"He was phenomenal and truly deserved the Man-of-the-Series award. Every time he went out, he scored runs, was their best bowler on view right through the series and kept coming hard.

Even regular cricket followers find it hard to recognise the other members of India's top order. This may be a comment on the enduring gulfs in culture, or more simply, gaps in fixtures; but after the summer of 1999 it is an unsustainable position. India supplied two of the outstanding batsmen of the World Cup, and neither of them was Tendulkar. Sourav Ganguly and Rahul Dravid had introduced themselves three years earlier. They made their Test debuts together at Lord's, Ganguly scoring 131 and Dravid 95 from No. 7. David Lloyd, then England coach, had been told by his observers that Ganguly would open the face of his bat outside off stump, while Dravid's weakness was working the straight ball to leg. This dossier was quickly consigned to the out-tray. Three years on, and the scene changes to Taunton, its bucolic traditions given over for a day to Asian exuberance. India are playing Sri Lanka in a World Cup group match. India lose a wicket in the opening over but they will not lose another until the total has reached 324. Ganguly and Dravid's stand of 318 is, by a distance, a record for any wicket in international one-day cricket (until November, when Ganguly and Tendulkar raise it to 331). For Dravid, the day brings his second century in four days. Despite India's failure to qualify for the second round, he would complete the tournament as its leading runscorer, and return home feted as a hero among perceived failures. To his embarrassment, Dravid fan clubs have sprung up, their membership loaded with teenage girls, and though his features may still be shamefully unfamiliar in England, they have attracted advertisers and film-makers in the land where star cricketers are national property. RAHUL DRAVID was born in Indore on January 11, 1973. The son of a food scientist, he was firmly encouraged to complete his studies before branching into sport, and obtained a degree in commerce at Bangalore University. But he made his first-class debut at 18, for Karnataka, and scored 134 in his second match. He was soon identified as one of the meteors of Indian cricket. Shy and introspective, he did not seek attention, but it was to come his way naturally, through weight of runs and an impression of quiet authority that led him to captaining most of the teams he represented. At first, his method was a painstaking one, his fierce determination to preserve his wicket matched by a desire to learn. In Toronto one year, he buttonholed Ian Chappell at a party and put searching questions to him for an hour. At Lord's he learned how to succeed and how to fail, all in the same innings. Had he made five more runs, it would have been the first time in the history of Test cricket that two debutants in the same team had made centuries. \"It hurt,\" he recalls. \"But I realised it would not do me any good to keep thinking about it.\" He went out in the next Test and made 84. At the start of 1999, India, a team that had spent too long confining its talents to one-day cricket, played a sudden raft of Test matches. They were beaten 1-0 in New Zealand, but the third game of that series, at Hamilton, belonged to Dravid, who made an elegant, eight-hour 190 in the first innings and followed it with 103 not out in the second. In Colombo seven weeks later, he made his fifth Test century, against Sri Lanka. By now, he had a Test average of 54 and had cemented his preferred place at No. 3. Next, though, came the World Cup and further evidence that this pleasing player is far more capable than most of his countrymen on alien pitches, reason enough for Kent to engage Dravid as their overseas player for 2000. He was also to demonstrate that his game had moved on and that he was resourceful enough to dominate. In late November, as he waited in a Mumbai hotel for the flight to Australia and another challenging chapter in his development, Dravid reflected on his golden year. \"I have improved a lot since 1996,\" he said earnestly, \"but my game can still progress further.\" Taunton, he said, had been \"great fun, fantastic\", but the World Cup, overall, had left him with mixed emotions. \"There are such expectations of us at home. We are followed very closely and people were disappointed. We had no excuses, although I thought we played well enough to reach the semi-finals.\" Dravid certainly did. His total of 461 runs, 63 more than his closest challenger Steve Waugh (Ganguly was third with 379), contained not only two successive centuries but also fifties under pressure against England and Pakistan. His batting was as undemonstrative as his personality, but as eloquent, too. It spoke of a man who has the time, both in technique and age, to graduate into the very highest company, and to do it with an understated, old-fashioned grace.

The Indian vice-captain scored 1,241 runs at an average of 95.46 in nine Tests in the 12-month perio d up to July 2004. — AP LONDON, SEPT. 8. Rahul Dravid grew in stature at the inaugural ICC Awards, winning two major prizes to enhance his image in the cricket world. Dravid claimed the coveted award of the evening — The Player of the Year — in addition to being adjudged the Test player of the Year. He also found a place in the Test Team of the Year. Irfan Pathan walked away with Emerging Player Of The Year award. The evening was made memorable by Virender Sehwag and Sachin Tendulkar earning a place in the One Day Team of the Year. The ICC Awards gave credence to the game's most successful players of the past 12 months. The voting panel included the 10 ICC full member captains, the Emirate Elite Panel of eight ICC umpires, seven members of the Emirates Elite Panel of ICC referees and a combination of 25 former cricketing legends and members of the media. Dravid aggregated 64 votes to win the Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy as he beat the challenge from England all-rounder Andrew Flintoff (44), South African all-rounder Jacques Kallis (44) and Australian batsman Matthew Hayden (38). For the Test Player award, Dravid polled 82 votes, ahead of Hayden (53), England fast bowler Steve Harmison (38) and Sri Lankan great Muthiah Muralitharan (30).

But I still believe there is a lot to achieve.\" Pathan claimed 100 votes ahead of Pakistan's Yasir Hameed (75 votes) and Australia's Michael Clarke (45). Pakistan's young fast bowler Umar Gul polled 21 votes. Pathan, who remarked that playing for India was the greatest motivation for him, added \"for me making my debut for India was the biggest moment of my life. But I will cherish this because this is the first award I have won.\" The one-day international player of the year award was bagged by the hugely-gifted English all-rounder Andrew Flintoff. He collected 58 votes and was followed by Tendulkar (47), Adam Gilchrist (36) and Ricky Ponting (36). Simon Taufel was rated the best umpire of the year by Test captains and the match referees.

While Justice Venkatachaliah, who had also served as chairman of the National Human Rights Commission, received the award from Mr Kalam amidst great applause, the other two Padma Vibhushan awardees, eminent astrophysicist Jayant V Narlikar and the ailing writer Amrita Pritam, were not present at the ceremony. Characteristic style In his characteristic style, Mr Kalam came down from the podium to present the medallions to those who were too old and had problems in walking. Dravid, along with Indian cricket captain Saurav Ganguly, were the two cricketers who received the Padma Shri from the President amidst probably the biggest round of cheers in the whole ceremony. “It is a great honour for me to receive this prestigious award,” Dravid said afterwards. As both cricketers as well as other eminent guests, including Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh, interacted freely with other people after the function, Dravid, when asked whether the Padma Shri would put additional pressure on him to perform even better, said, “the pressure of performance will always be there for any sportsperson.” Those who received the Padma Bhushan along with Mr Gulzar included noted economist C Hanumantha Rao, scientist G Padmanabhan, Bharatnatyam danseuse Alarmel Valli, Veena exponent Madurai T N Seshagopalan and 91-year-old social worker Poornima Arvind Pakvasa. Former Japanese Premier Yoshiro Mori, who was also given the Padma Bhushan, was not present to receive his award. Among those who received the Padma Shri were Censor Board chairman and noted actor-director Anupam Kher, singer Hariharan, Persian scholar Asifa Zamani, Santoor player Pandit Bhajan Sopori, film director Bharathi Raja, novelist Dalip Kaur Tiwana from Punjab, mountaineer G Anita Devi, athlete K M Beenamol and Kathakali dance exponent K Kumaran Nair.", "India's Rahul Dravid was named captain of the ICC's Test Team of the Year at the 2006 International Cricket Council Awards, sponsored by Hyundai, in Mumbai on Friday.

साल तक जमी रही आज वह 'ढह' गई। राहुल द्रविड़ ने इंटरनैशनल और नैशनल क्रिकेट के सभी फॉर्मैट से रिटायर होने की घोषणा कर दी। वह इंटरनैशनल वनडे और ट्वेंटी-20 क्रिकेट को पहले ही अलविदा कह चुके थे, शुक्रवार को टेस्ट क्रिकेट से संन्यास लेने की घोषणा कर दी। अपने 16 साल के क्रिकेट करियर का जिक्र करते हुए साथी और सीनियर क्रिकेटरों, कोच, क्रिकेट प्रशासकों और मीडिया का शुक्रिया अदा किया।तस्वरोंमें : राहुल का क्रिकेटनामाचिन्नास्वामी स्टेडियम में खचाखच भरे हॉल में जब राहुल ने संन्यास लेने की घोषणा की तो, उनके साथ भारतीय क्रिकेट बोर्ड के प्रेजिडेंट एन. श्रीनिवासन और कर्नाटक क्रिकेट असोसिएशन के प्रेजिडेंट अनिल कुंबले भी थे। द्रविड़ ने कहा, 'मैं इंटरनैशनल और फर्स्ट क्लास क्रिकेट से संन्यास लेने की घोषणा करता हूं। मैंने भारत के लिए 16 साल पहले अपना पहला टेस्ट खेला था और आज मुझे लगता है कि आगे बढ़ने का समय आ गया है। मैं एक ऐसे लड़के की तरह ही था जो अपने देश की ओर से खेलने का सपना देखता है। मैंने कभी नहीं सोचा था कि मेरी यात्रा इतनी लंबी और इतनी बेहतरीन रहेगी।'उन्होंने कहा,'कोई भी सपना अकेले पूरा नहीं हो सकता। मैं उन लोगों का शुक्रिया अदा करना चाहूंगा जिन्होंने मुझे क्रिकेट सिखाया और मुझ पर भरोसा रखा। बेंगलुरु में मेरे जूनियर कोचों और अलग-अलग जूनियर नैशनल कैंप ने मुझे क्रिकेट के प्रति इतना जुनूनी बनाया।'द्रविड़ ने कहा, 'इंटरनैशनल स्तर पर मेरे कोचों ने मेरी क्रिकेट में सुधार किया और इससे मेरी पर्सनैलिटी को निखरने में मदद मिली। फिजियो और ट्रेनरों ने मुझे फिट बनाने के लिये काफी मेहनत की जो आसान काम नहीं है। इसकी बदौलत मैं 39 की उम्र तक खेलता रहा।'उन्होंने कहा, 'भारत में सिलेक्टर्स को कभी भी कोई क्रेडिट नहीं मिलता। लेकिन उन्होंने कई बार मुझ पर भरोसा जताया बल्कि इतना भरोसा मुझे खुद पर नहीं था और मैं इसके लिए उनका शुक्रगुजार हूं। मैं जितने भी कप्तानों की अगुवाई में खेला, उन्होंने मुझे प्रेरित किया। सबसे ज्यादा मैं उन टीमों का शुक्रिया अदा करना चाहूंगा, जिनके साथ मैं खेला।'द्रविड़ ने कहा कि उनकी टीम के साथियों के साथ कई शानदार यादें जुड़ी हैं। इसमें कुछ महान खिलाड़ी भी शामिल हैं। उन्होंने कहा, 'मैं करियर के शुरू के दिनों में कर्नाटक की टीम से खेला और वे साल मेरे लिए काफी मनोरंजक और सीख हासिल करने वाले रहे।' उन्होंने कहा, 'भारतीय टीम में मैं उस शानदार युग का हिस्सा रहा जिसमें भारत ने घरेलू और विदेशी सरजमीं पर कुछ बेहतरीन क्रिकेट खेला। टीम के कई साथी महान बन गए, भारत में ही नहीं बल्कि पूरी क्रिकेट दुनिया में। मैं उनकी काफी तारीफ करता हूं, मैंने उनसे काफी कुछ सीखा है और मैं क्रिकेट को उनके साथ बिताए गए समय की शानदार यादों और मजबूत दोस्ती के साथ अलविदा कह रहा हूं। यह शानदार भेंट है।' Hindi Hindi IND Photogallery GOLD Login ऑटो फोटो वीडियो राज्य भारत जोक्स क्रिप्टोकरेंसी खान-पान विचार यात्रा ओमीक्रोन चुनाव भोजपुरी गुड न्यूज वेब सीरीज टीवी अपना बाजार कार्टून फोटो

मास्टर ब्लास्टर सचिन तेंदुलकर ने कहा है कि अंतरराष्ट्रीय क्रिकेट में सिर्फ़ एक ही राहुल द्रविड़ हो सकता है. सचिन ने कहा, \"राहुल द्रविड़ जैसा दूसरा कोई नहीं हो सकता. मैं ड्रेसिंग रूम और मैदान में राहुल द्रविड़ की कमी महसूस करूँगा.\" वर्ष 2000 से 2005 तक भारतीय क्रिकेट टीम के कोच रहे जॉन राइट ने कहा है कि राहुल द्रविड़ उन सर्वश्रेष्ठ खिलाड़ियों में से एक हैं, जिनके साथ उन्होंने काम किया है. उन्होंने कहा, \"द्रविड़ भारत के महान बल्लेबाज़ों में से एक हैं. हर माहौल में वे बेहतरीन थे, जिन्होंने हर जगह रन बनाए. वे न सिर्फ़ महान क्रिकेटर हैं, बल्कि अच्छे इंसान भी हैं.\" भारत के पूर्व कप्तान और कर्नाटक के उनके साथी खिलाड़ी अनिल कुंबले ने भी द्रविड़ को क्रिकेट का राजदूत बताया है. द्रविड़ के संन्यास के समय वे राहुल द्रविड़ के साथ बैठे थे. कुंबले ने कहा, \"मेरा सौभाग्य है कि मैं द्रविड़ के साथ

की है. माइकल वॉन ने ट्विटर पर लिखा है- राहुल द्रविड़ ने संन्यास लिया, पिछले 20 वर्षों का सबसे सम्मानित क्रिकेटर. पीटरसन ने ट्विटर पर लिखा- राहुल द्रविड़ लीजेंड. सादा और साधारण. एक बेहतरीन करियर के लिए बधाई. भारत द वॉल को मिस करेगा. भारतीय क्रिकेट कंट्रोल बोर्ड (बीसीसीआई) के प्रमुख एन श्रीनिवासन ने राहुल द्रविड़ को बेहतरीन खिलाड़ियों में गिना. उन्होंने द्रविड़ को महान रोल मॉडल कहा. आईपीएल में राजस्थान रॉयल की ओर से राहुल द्रविड़ के साथ खेल चुके ऑस्ट्रेलियन ऑल राउंडर शेन वॉटसन ने उन्हें विश्व क्रिकेट का सबसे बेहतरीन खिलाड़ी बताया है. भारत के महानतम खिलाड़ियों में से एक सुनील गावसकर ने भी

वो बेहतरीन था. राहुल द्रविड़ ऐसे खिलाड़ी थे, ड्रेसिंग रूम में जिनकी तरफ युवा खिलाड़ी देखता था. सचिन तेंदुलकर ने युवा खिलाड़ियों को प्रेरित किया, लेकिन ये खिलाड़ी जानते थे कि सचिन कुछ खास हैं, लेकिन वे राहुल द्रविड़ की ओर ऐसे देखते थे जैसे वे सभी द्रविड़ बन सकते हैं. राहुल हमेशा मेहनत करने वाले खिलाड़ी थे. उनके संन्यास से बड़ा शून्य पैदा हो गया है.\" ट्विटर पर अमिताभ बच्चन ने भी राहुल के संन्यास लेने पर उनकी भूमिका की सराहना की है. अमिताभ बच्चन ने लिखा है- सबसे ज्यादा भरोसेमंद, जेंटिलमैन, निस्वार्थ भाव से खेलने वाले क्रिकेटर ने संन्यास ले लिया है. दक्षिण अफ़्रीका के पूर्व कप्तान शॉन पोलक ने

लेने के फैसले को सही ठहराया है. दिल्ली में सौरव गांगुली ने कहा कि राहुल द्रविड़ एक बेहतरीन बल्लेबाज ही नहीं, अच्छे विकेट कीपर और कप्तान भी थे. उनके संन्यास से खाली हुई जगह को भरना आसान नहीं होगा. गांगुली के मुताबिक द्रविड़ तीसरे नंबर पर खेलने वाले दुनिया के सबसे भरोसेमंद बल्लेबाज थे. गांगुली का कहना है कि राहुल द्रविड़ ने वीवीएस लक्ष्मण की मदद से भारतीय टीम को न सिर्फ कई अहम जीत दिलाई है बल्कि भारत में क्रिकेट की दशा और दिशा को भी बदला है. द्रविड़ पर संन्यास लेने के लिए दबाव बनाए जाने की अटकलों को दरकिनार करते हुए गांगुली ने कहा, \"राहुल द्रविड़ पर कोई दबाव बना सके, ऐसा हो ही नहीं सकता. ये उनका खुद का निर्णय है जिसका हम सभी स्वागत करते हैं. गांगुली के अनुसार द्रविड़ की उपलब्धियां इतनी ज्यादा है कि कि किसी भी नए खिलाड़ी को उन जैसा बनने में 15 साल लग जाएंगे.\" ये पूछने पर कि मैदान पर राहुल का व्यक्तिव जितना धीर-गंभीर और सादा दिखता है क्या ड्रेसिंग रूम में भी वे वैसे ही हैं? इसके जवाब में गांगुली ने पहले तो मजाकिया लहज़े में कहा कि हां वो काफी खिझाते थे लेकिन फिर कहा कि राहुल के साथ बिताया हर लम्हा काफी अच्छा और सुखद रहा है. © 2022 BBC. बाहरी साइटों की सामग्री के लिए बीबीसी ज़िम्मेदार नहीं है. बाहरी साइटों का लिंक देने की हमारी नीति के बारे में पढ़ें.

By Ranabir Majumdar 'The Wall' was a finisher. A clinical finisher - gentle and serene. He was probably also the most important fulcrum in India's middle-order lineup, both in Tests and ODIs. At a time when Sourav Ganguly restructured Team India, Dravid kept wickets and got the runs off the bat. Undoubtedly Ganguly was a great leader, but one wonders what fate would have befallen the 'Prince of Kolkata', had he not had Dravid as his running mate. Just have a look at the US Presidential elections and you will know the importance of a good running mate. One slip here and the entire campaign could end up in tatters. Dravid never allowed that. Even as skipper he showed the same intensity and finally when he gave up that position, he must have had a farewell script running somewhere in the back of his mind. That farewell script is now on the verge of being disturbed if Dravid does not take matters in his own hands. He has had a patchy and scratchy season so far and even though he joined the 10,000-Test run club earlier this year and then went past Sunil Gavaskar's aggregate in Galle recently, he is far removed from the Dravid of the 2002-05 period. The ICC Awards ceremony at Dubai on September 10 is bound to rewind time for Dravid who was the first winner of the Test Player of the Year award and the Cricket of the Year award at the inaugural awards in 2004. The 2002-05 period is remembered as the very best of Dravid's Test career. He started off with a slew of centuries against England and West Indies, led India's battling lineup in the tough tour of Down Under as the visitors squared a Test series in Australia for the first time in 13 years and then took over the mantle of captaincy. Since his show in the England summer last year, the batsman has looked less than confident but he is too good a player to miss out on for a long time. True, he took a long time to read and deconstruct the new spin phenomenon Ajantha Mendis, but the fact also is that he did get a couple of decisions that were circumspect. As debate and discussion rages on about the role of the seniors in the team, especially with younger players claiming a place under the sun in the shorter versions of game, India's calendar ahead presents Dravid to script a swansong farewell. Australia tour India for four Test matches, followed by England's arrival, a full tour to Pakistan early next year and then on to New Zealand. It's only after that an only ODI and T20 season clicks in. So from this year's awards on the television to the next one in flesh and blood - Dravid could script that farewell that is so well deserved of a contemporary giant and a gentleman.

टेस्ट मैच 1877 में ऑस्ट्रेलिया और इंग्लैंड के बीच खेला गया था और बाद के वर्षों में दोनों टीमों ने एशेज के लिए नियमित रूप से प्रतिस्पर्धा की। 1889 में दक्षिण अफ्रीका को टेस्ट दर्जा दिया गया। द्विपक्षीय क्रिकेट प्रतियोगिता के परिणामस्वरूप प्रतिनिधि क्रिकेट टीमों को एक दूसरे के दौरे के लिए चुना गया था। साल 1900 पेरिस खेलों में एक ओलंपिक खेल के रूप में क्रिकेट को भी शामिल किया गया था, जहाँ ग्रेट ब्रिटेन ने फ्रांस को हराकर स्वर्ण पदक जीता था। ग्रीष्मकालीन ओलंपिक में यह क्रिकेट की एकमात्र उपस्थिति थी। उस समय इंग्लैंड में तीन टेस्ट खेलने वाले देशों में पहला अंतरराष्ट्रीय बहुपक्षीय टूर्नामेंट 1912 त्रिकोणीय टूर्नामेंट, इंग्लैंड, ऑस्ट्रेलिया और दक्षिण अफ्रीका के बीच एक टेस्ट क्रिकेट मैच था। यह आयोजन सफल नहीं था: गर्मियों में बहुत गीला था, बिना पक्की पिचों पर खेलना मुश्किल था और भीड़ कम थी, यही कारण है कि इसे \"क्रिकेट की गति\" कहा जाता है। तब से, अंतर्राष्ट्रीय टेस्ट क्रिकेट को आम तौर पर द्विपक्षीय श्रृंखला के रूप में आयोजित किया गया है: 1999 में त्रिकोणीय एशियाई टेस्ट चैम्पियनशिप तक एक बहुपक्षीय टेस्ट टूर्नामेंट फिर से आयोजित नहीं किया गया था। टेस्ट क्रिकेट खेलने वाले देशों की संख्या धीरे-धीरे समय के साथ बढ़ती गई, 1928 में वेस्ट इंडीज के साथ, 1930 में न्यूजीलैंड, 1932 में भारत और 1952 में पाकिस्तान के साथ हुई। हालाँकि, अंतर्राष्ट्रीय क्रिकेट तीन, चार या पाँच दिनों में द्विपक्षीय टेस्ट मैचों के रूप में खेला जाता रहा। 1960 के दशक की शुरुआत में, अंग्रेजी काउंटी क्रिकेट टीमों ने क्रिकेट का एक छोटा संस्करण खेलना शुरू किया जो केवल एक दिन तक चला। वनडे क्रिकेट इंग्लैंड में लोकप्रियता में वृद्धि हुई है, जिसकी शुरुआत 1962 में मिडलैंड्स नॉक-आउट कप के चार-टीम नॉकआउट चरणों और 1963 में जिलेट कप के उद्घाटन के साथ हुई थी। 1969 में एक नेशनल संडे लीग का गठन किया गया था। पहला ओडीआई 1971 में मेलबर्न में इंग्लैंड और ऑस्ट्रेलिया के बीच वर्षा-असफल टेस्ट के पांचवें दिन खेला गया था, इसलिए समय था और जो लोग निराश थे, उन्हें मुआवजा दिया जाना चाहिए। यह एक चालीस ओवर का खेल था जिसमें आठ गेंदें प्रति ओवर थीं। 1970 के दशक के उत्तरार्ध में, केरी पैकर ने प्रतिद्वंद्वी विश्व सीरीज क्रिकेट (डब्ल्यूएससी) प्रतियोगिता की स्थापना की। इसने वन डे इंटरनेशनल क्रिकेट की कई सामान्य विशेषताओं को पेश किया, जिसमें रंगीन वर्दी, एक सफेद गेंद और अंधेरे दृष्टि स्क्रीन के साथ फ्लड लाइट के तहत रात में खेले जाने वाले मैच, और टेलीविजन प्रसारण, कई कैमरा कोण, पिच पर खिलाड़ी का प्रभाव माइक्रोफोन से ध्वनियों को पकड़ने के लिए शामिल हैं और ऑन-स्क्रीन ग्राफिक्स। रंग की वर्दी के साथ मैचों में पहली बार डब्ल्यूएससी आस्ट्रेलियन में मवेशी सोने बनाम डब्ल्यूएससी पश्चिम भारतीयों में कोरल गुलाबी, 17 जनवरी 1979 को मेलबर्न में व्हीएफएल पार्क में खेला गया था। इंग्लैंड और दुनिया के अन्य हिस्सों में घरेलू एक दिवसीय प्रतियोगिताओं की सफलता और लोकप्रियता, साथ ही साथ शुरुआती एक दिवसीय अंतर्राष्ट्रीय, ने आईसीसी को क्रिकेट विश्व कप के आयोजन पर विचार करने के लिए प्रेरित किया। प्रूडेंशियल विश्व कप (1975-1983) thumb|upright=0.9|प्रूडेंशियल कप ट्रॉफी 1975 में, इंग्लैंड ने उद्घाटन क्रिकेट विश्व कप की मेजबानी की उस समय यह एकमात्र राष्ट्र था जो इतनी विशालता को व्यवस्थित करने के लिए संसाधनों को आगे रखने में सक्षम था। 1975 का टूर्नामेंट 7 जून को शुरू हुआ था। पहले तीन कार्यक्रम इंग्लैंड में आयोजित किए गए थे और प्रायोजक प्रुडेंशियल पीएलसी के बाद आधिकारिक रूप से प्रूडेंशियल कप के रूप में मान्यता दी गई थी। मैचों में प्रति टीम छह बॉल के 60 ओवर शामिल थे, जो पारंपरिक रूप में दिन के दौरान खेला जाता था, जिसमें खिलाड़ियों के सफेद कपड़े होते थे और लाल क्रिकेट गेंदों का उपयोग करते थे।Browning (1999), pp. 5–9 पहले टूर्नामेंट में आठ टीमें थीं: ऑस्ट्रेलिया, इंग्लैंड, भारत, न्यूजीलैंड, पाकिस्तान और वेस्ट इंडीज (उस समय छह टेस्ट राष्ट्र) और श्रीलंका और पूर्वी अफ्रीका की एक संयुक्त टीम।Browning (1999), pp. 26–31 एक उल्लेखनीय चूक दक्षिण अफ्रीका की थी, जिन्हें रंगभेद के कारण अंतरराष्ट्रीय क्रिकेट से प्रतिबंधित कर दिया गया था। इस टूर्नामेंट को वेस्टइंडीज ने जीता था, जिसने फाइनल में ऑस्ट्रेलिया को लॉर्ड्स में 17 रनों से हराया था। वेस्टइंडीज के रॉय फ्रेडरिक पहले बल्लेबाज थे जिन्होंने 1975 विश्व कप फाइनल के दौरान वनडे में हिट-विकेट हासिल किया था। 1979 विश्व कप में श्रीलंका और कनाडा के क्वालीफाइंग के साथ विश्व कप के लिए गैर-टेस्ट खेलने वाली टीमों का चयन करने के लिए आईसीसी ट्रॉफी प्रतियोगिता की शुरुआत हुई।Browning (1999), pp. 32–35 वेस्टइंडीज ने लगातार दूसरा विश्व कप टूर्नामेंट जीता, फाइनल में मेजबान इंग्लैंड को 92 रन से हराया। विश्व कप के बाद होने वाली एक बैठक में, अंतर्राष्ट्रीय क्रिकेट सम्मेलन प्रतियोगिता को एक चतुष्कोणीय आयोजन बनाने के लिए सहमत हुआ। 1983 की घटना को इंग्लैंड ने लगातार तीसरी बार आयोजित किया था। इस चरण तक, श्रीलंका एक टेस्ट खेलने वाला देश बन गया था, और जिम्बाब्वे ने आईसीसी ट्रॉफी के माध्यम से क्वालीफाई किया था। स्टंप्स से दूर एक फील्डिंग सर्कल पेश किया गया था। चार क्षेत्ररक्षक को हर समय इसके अंदर रहने की आवश्यकता थी।Browning (1999), pp. 61–62 नॉक-आउट में जाने से पहले टीमों ने दो बार एक-दूसरे का सामना किया। फाइनल में वेस्टइंडीज को 43 रनों से हराकर भारत चैंपियन बन गया।Browning (1999), pp. 105–110 विभिन्न चैंपियन (1987-1996) भारत और पाकिस्तान ने संयुक्त रूप से 1987 टूर्नामेंट की मेजबानी की, पहली बार यह प्रतियोगिता इंग्लैंड के बाहर आयोजित की गई थी। इंग्लैंड की गर्मियों की तुलना में भारतीय उपमहाद्वीप में दिन के उजाले के घंटे कम होने के कारण खेल प्रति पारी 60 से 50 ओवर तक कम हो गया था।Browning (1999), pp. 111–116 ऑस्ट्रेलिया ने फाइनल में इंग्लैंड को 7 रनों से हराकर चैंपियनशिप जीती, इंग्लैंड और न्यूजीलैंड के बीच 2019 संस्करण तक विश्व कप फाइनल में निकटतम अंतर था।Browning (1999), pp. 155–159 ऑस्ट्रेलिया और न्यूजीलैंड में आयोजित 1992 विश्व कप ने खेल में कई बदलावों को पेश किया, जैसे रंगीन कपड़े, सफेद गेंद, दिन/रात के मैच और क्षेत्ररक्षण प्रतिबंध नियमों में बदलाव आ गए थे। रंगभेद शासन के पतन और अंतर्राष्ट्रीय खेल बहिष्कार की समाप्ति के बाद पहली बार दक्षिण अफ्रीकी क्रिकेट टीम ने इस आयोजन में भाग लिया।Browning (1999), pp. 160–161 पाकिस्तान ने टूर्नामेंट में निराशाजनक शुरुआत की और अंततः फाइनल में इंग्लैंड को 22 रनों से हरा दिया और विजेता के रूप में उभरा।Browning (1999), pp. 211–214 1996 की चैंपियनशिप भारतीय उपमहाद्वीप में दूसरी बार आयोजित की गई थी, जिसमें ग्रुप के कुछ मैचों के लिए श्रीलंका को मेजबान के रूप में शामिल किया गया था।Browning (1999), pp. 215–217 सेमीफाइनल में, श्रीलंका ने ईडन गार्डन पर भारत को कुचलने वाली जीत की ओर बढ़ रहे थे, जब मेजबान टीम ने आठ विकेट गंवाकर 252 रन के लक्ष्य का पीछा करते हुए 120 रन बनाए थे, तो भारतीय प्रदर्शन के विरोध में भीड़ की अशांति के बाद डिफ़ॉल्ट रूप से जीत हासिल की गई थी। लाहौर में फाइनल में ऑस्ट्रेलिया को सात विकेट से हराकर श्रीलंका ने अपनी पहली चैंपियनशिप जीती।Browning (1999), pp. 264–274 ऑस्ट्रेलियाई ट्रेबल (1999-2007) 1999 में इस प्रतिस्पर्धा की मेजबानी इंग्लैंड ने की थी, जिसमें कुछ मैच स्कॉटलैंड, आयरलैंड, वेल्स और नीदरलैंड में भी आयोजित किए गए थे।Browning (1999), p. 274 विश्व कप में 12 टीमों ने चुनाव लड़ा। मैच के अंतिम ओवर में दक्षिण अफ्रीका के खिलाफ अपने सुपर 6 मैच में अपने लक्ष्य तक पहुंचने के बाद ऑस्ट्रेलिया ने सेमीफाइनल के लिए क्वालीफाई किया।Browning (1999), pp. 229–231 इसके बाद वे सेमीफाइनल में एक टाई मैच के साथ दक्षिण अफ्रीका के खिलाफ भी फाइनल में पहुंच गए, जहां दक्षिण अफ्रीका के बल्लेबाज लांस क्लूजनर और एलन डोनाल्ड के बीच मिक्स-अप ने डोनाल्ड को अपना बल्ला गिराते देखा और बीच-बीच में रन आउट होने के लिए फंसे। फाइनल में, ऑस्ट्रेलिया ने पाकिस्तान को 132 रनों पर आउट कर दिया और फिर 20 ओवर से कम और आठ विकेट के साथ लक्ष्य हासिल कर लिया।Browning (1999), pp. 232–238 thumb|upright=0.9|10,000 से अधिक प्रशंसकों की भीड़ पहले विश्व कप हैट्रिक – मार्टिन प्लेस, सिडनी को पूरा करने पर ऑस्ट्रेलियाई टीम का स्वागत करती है। दक्षिण अफ्रीका, जिम्बाब्वे और केन्या ने 2003 विश्व कप की मेजबानी की। आयोजन में भाग लेने वाली टीमों की संख्या बारह से बढ़कर चौदह हो गई। श्रीलंका और जिम्बाब्वे के बीच केन्या की जीत - और न्यूजीलैंड टीम द्वारा एक जाली, जिसने सुरक्षा चिंताओं के कारण केन्या में खेलने से इनकार कर दिया - केन्या को सेमीफाइनल में पहुंचने में सक्षम बनाया, एक सहयोगी द्वारा सबसे अच्छा परिणाम। फाइनल में, ऑस्ट्रेलिया ने दो विकेट के नुकसान पर 359 रन बनाए, एक फाइनल में अब तक का सबसे बड़ा, भारत को 125 रन से हराया। 2007 में इस टूर्नामेंट की मेजबानी वेस्ट इंडीज ने की और सोलह टीमों का विस्तार किया। ग्रुप स्टेज में वर्ल्ड कप डेब्यूटेंट्स आयरलैंड को मिली पाकिस्तान की हार के बाद पाकिस्तानी कोच बॉब वूल्मर अपने होटल के कमरे में मृत पाए गए। जमैका पुलिस ने शुरू में वूलर की मौत की हत्या की जांच शुरू की थी, लेकिन बाद में पुष्टि की कि उनकी हृदय गति रुकने से मृत्यु हो गई। ऑस्ट्रेलिया ने फाइनल में श्रीलंका को 53 रनों (डी/एल) से दूर की हल्की परिस्थितियों में हराया, और विश्व कप में अपने अपराजित रन को 29 मैचों तक बढ़ाया और तीन सीधे चैंपियनशिप जीती। मेजबान जीत (2011-2019) भारत, श्रीलंका और बांग्लादेश ने एक साथ 2011 क्रिकेट विश्व कप की मेजबानी की। 2009 में श्रीलंकाई क्रिकेट टीम पर हुए आतंकवादी हमले के बाद पाकिस्तान ने अपने मेजबानी अधिकार छीन लिए थे, मूल रूप से पाकिस्तान ने दूसरे मेजबान देशों को पुनर्वितरित करने वाले खेलों के साथ। विश्व कप में भाग लेने वाली टीमों की संख्या चौदह हो गई। ऑस्ट्रेलिया ने 19 मार्च 2011 को पाकिस्तान के खिलाफ अपने अंतिम ग्रुप स्टेज मैच को खो दिया, जिसने 35 विश्व कप मैचों की नाबाद लकीर को समाप्त कर दिया, जिसकी शुरुआत 23 मई 1999 को हुई थी। भारत ने मुंबई में फाइनल में श्रीलंका को 6 विकेट से हराकर अपना दूसरा विश्व कप खिताब जीता और घरेलू धरती पर फाइनल जीतने वाला पहला देश बन गया। ऑस्ट्रेलिया और न्यूजीलैंड ने संयुक्त रूप से 2015 क्रिकेट विश्व कप की मेजबानी की। प्रतिभागियों की संख्या चौदह पर रही। टूर्नामेंट में कुल तीन जीत के साथ आयरलैंड सबसे सफल एसोसिएट राष्ट्र था। न्यूजीलैंड ने दक्षिण अफ्रीका को अपने पहले विश्व कप फाइनल के लिए क्वालीफाई करने के लिए पहले सेमीफाइनल में हरा दिया। ऑस्ट्रेलिया ने मेलबर्न में फाइनल में न्यूजीलैंड को सात विकेट से हराकर पांचवीं बार विश्व कप जीता। thumb|right|इंग्लैंड अपनी जीत के बाद लॉर्ड्स के चारों ओर सम्मान की एक गोद देता है। 2019 क्रिकेट विश्व कप की मेजबानी इंग्लैंड और वेल्स ने की थी। प्रतिभागियों की संख्या घटाकर 10 कर दी गई। पहला सेमीफाइनल जहां न्यूजीलैंड ने भारत को हराया था, उसे बारिश के दिन के बाद आरक्षित दिन के लिए धकेल दिया गया था जिससे मैच मूल निर्धारित दिन पर पूरा नहीं हो सका। इंग्लैंड ने गत चैंपियन ऑस्ट्रेलिया को हराकर दूसरे सेमीफाइनल में न्यूजीलैंड से फाइनल में जगह बनाई। इससे पहले किसी भी फाइनलिस्ट ने इस पॉइंट तक क्रिकेट विश्व कप नहीं जीता है। फाइनल में, 50 ओवर के बाद स्कोर 241 से बराबरी पर था और मैच सुपर ओवर में चला गया। सुपर ओवर के बाद, स्कोर फिर से 15 पर बंधे थे। इसलिए मैच टाई हो गया था, लेकिन विश्व कप इंग्लैंड ने अपनी संबंधित बल्लेबाजी पारी में न्यूजीलैंड की तुलना में अधिक बाउंड्री के कारण फाइनल जीता था।", "references": ["SL PAK Day 3 - Session 2: Sri Lanka lead by 206 runs.

That started in 1877, some 33 years after a side representing USA met a team from Canada at Bloomingdale Park in Manhattan. It is believed that it is the world's oldest international sporting rivalry, pre-dating the Americas Cup by seven years.There are some who dispute the validity of the claim that the game was an international. It was advertised locally as a meeting between USA and Canada even though the players were, in the main, drawn from two clubs. While the first contemporary reference to the sides being from USA and Canada did not come until 1853, it is generally acknowledged to have been an international.The encounter could actually have happened four years earlier. The St George's Club received an invitation from a Mr Phillpotts to travel to play a game against Toronto at a ground on the shores of Lake Ontario. A squad of 18 New Yorkers made a gruelling journey only to find on arrival on August 28 that the bemused Toronto club knew nothing about the proposal. St George's had been the victim of a hoax. Nevertheless, Toronto raised a side to play for a stake of $250 a side, and in front of a decent crowd, St George's won by ten wickets.The relationship had been established and four years later a genuine invitation was sent to Toronto, who accepted. The stake had been upped to $1000 and the venue was to be the grounds of the St George's Club (around East 31 Street and First Avenue, at the time a rural setting) with two days - September 24 and 25 - put aside for the game.The trip south for the Canadians was exhausting. They travelled by boat up the St Lawrence and across Lake Ontario before boarding a train on the burgeoning rail network on the American side. The trains had no buffet cars and so food had to be snatched at the irregular stops.A large crowd, around 5000, was present on the first day and, as was customary, betting was to the fore. It is estimated that as much as $100,000 was bet on the match, close to $2 million in modern money. The game was scheduled to start at 10am but the teams were in no hurry and it eventually got underway at 11.40am.Canada batted and were bowled out midway through the afternoon for 82. Given the state of pitches at the time, it was a respectable score, although contemporary accounts refer to the poor fielding of the USA. David Winckworth joint top-scored with 12, while Yorkshire-born Sam Wright and Harry Groom shared the wickets between them.Winckworth is an interesting character and he can claim to be the first dual international. He appeared for Canada in the first three games against USA (there were two in 1845) and then, on moving to Detroit, he turned out for USA in 1846.It is estimated that as much as $100,000 was bet on the match, close to $2 million in modern moneyAfter an hour's break for a late lunch, USA batted, and although their innings extended into a second day, they conceded a first-innings lead of 18. What should have been the second day was in fact washed out and it was agreed that the match would resume on September 26. When Canada batted again Winckworth, who had taken four wickets with some quick bowling, again top-scored with 14 as Canada made 63.USA were set a target of 82, although they had an immediate problem in that their No. 3, George Wheatcroft, had not turned up. James Turner and John Syme gave them a good start, but from 25 for 0 they lost six wickets for 11 runs once George Sharpe came on. The tail wagged slightly but USA only managed 58, losing by 23 runs. Earlier in the year Turner had scored 120 in a club match, believed to be the first three-figure score on US soil.Some 20 minutes after the last wicket fell, Wheatcroft arrived. A heated but brief argument ensued as USA tried to insist he was entitled to bat, but the Canadians were having none of it.In 1845 the sides met again home and away - Canada winning by 61 runs in Montreal at the end of July and by two wickets in New York a month later - and then in Harlem, New York in August 1846. USA finally broke their duck at the fourth time of asking, but in highly controversial circumstances and the fixture was suspended for seven years.\"Cricket was by far the biggest sport [in the USA] in this period,\" Tim Lockley, an expert in American history at Warwick University, told the Guardian in 1999. \"Then the civil war started in 1861, just when it was reaching its peak of popularity. The sport became a victim of that war.\"The USA-Canada contest continued intermittently. They last met in 2004 in the ICC Intercontinental Cup in Florida, the only occasion that the two have faced off in a first-class match.Is there an incident from the past you would like to know more about?

That started in 1877, some 33 years after a side representing USA met a team from Canada at Bloomingdale Park in Manhattan. It is believed that it is the world's oldest international sporting rivalry, pre-dating the Americas Cup by seven years. There are some who dispute the validity of the claim that the game was an international. It was advertised locally as a meeting between USA and Canada even though the players were, in the main, drawn from two clubs. While the first contemporary reference to the sides being from USA and Canada did not come until 1853, it is generally acknowledged to have been an international. The encounter could actually have happened four years earlier. The St George's Club received an invitation from a Mr Phillpotts to travel to play a game against Toronto at a ground on the shores of Lake Ontario. A squad of 18 New Yorkers made a gruelling journey only to find on arrival on August 28 that the bemused Toronto club knew nothing about the proposal. St George's had been the victim of a hoax. Nevertheless, Toronto raised a side to play for a stake of $250 a side, and in front of a decent crowd, St George's won by ten wickets. The relationship had been established and four years later a genuine invitation was sent to Toronto, who accepted. The stake had been upped to $1000 and the venue was to be the grounds of the St George's Club (around East 31 Street and First Avenue, at the time a rural setting) with two days - September 24 and 25 - put aside for the game. The trip south for the Canadians was exhausting. They travelled by boat up the St Lawrence and across Lake Ontario before boarding a train on the burgeoning rail network on the American side. The trains had no buffet cars and so food had to be snatched at the irregular stops. A large crowd, around 5000, was present on the first day and, as was customary, betting was to the fore. It is estimated that as much as $100,000 was bet on the match, close to $2 million in modern money. The game was scheduled to start at 10am but the teams were in no hurry and it eventually got underway at 11.40am. Canada batted and were bowled out midway through the afternoon for 82. Given the state of pitches at the time, it was a respectable score, although contemporary accounts refer to the poor fielding of the USA. David Winckworth joint top-scored with 12, while Yorkshire-born Sam Wright and Harry Groom shared the wickets between them. Winckworth is an interesting character and he can claim to be the first dual international. He appeared for Canada in the first three games against USA (there were two in 1845) and then, on moving to Detroit, he turned out for USA in 1846. After an hour's break for a late lunch, USA batted, and although their innings extended into a second day, they conceded a first-innings lead of 18. What should have been the second day was in fact washed out and it was agreed that the match would resume on September 26. When Canada batted again Winckworth, who had taken four wickets with some quick bowling, again top-scored with 14 as Canada made 63. USA were set a target of 82, although they had an immediate problem in that their No. 3, George Wheatcroft, had not turned up. James Turner and John Syme gave them a good start, but from 25 for 0 they lost six wickets for 11 runs once George Sharpe came on. The tail wagged slightly but USA only managed 58, losing by 23 runs. Earlier in the year Turner had scored 120 in a club match, believed to be the first three-figure score on US soil. Some 20 minutes after the last wicket fell, Wheatcroft arrived. A heated but brief argument ensued as USA tried to insist he was entitled to bat, but the Canadians were having none of it. In 1845 the sides met again home and away - Canada winning by 61 runs in Montreal at the end of July and by two wickets in New York a month later - and then in Harlem, New York in August 1846. USA finally broke their duck at the fourth time of asking, but in highly controversial circumstances and the fixture was suspended for seven years. \"Cricket was by far the biggest sport [in the USA] in this period,\" Tim Lockley, an expert in American history at Warwick University, told the Guardian in 1999. \"Then the civil war started in 1861, just when it was reaching its peak of popularity. The sport became a victim of that war.\" The USA-Canada contest continued intermittently. They last met in 2004 in the ICC Intercontinental Cup in Florida, the only occasion that the two have faced off in a first-class match.

The idea was sound - a competition involving the only three Test-playing countries of the time meeting each other three times - and when first mooted by South Africa's Sir Abe Bailey in 1909 was warmly welcomed. That it failed was due to circumstances almost entirely beyond the control of the organisers. The scheme was hatched at the very first meeting of the Imperial Cricket Council, a new world governing body, at Lord's in July 1909. At that inaugural gathering, such topics as eligibility of players to represent countries other than that of their birth and a programme for Test series were discussed - plus ca change. High on the agenda, and quickly agreed to, was a triangular contest, to be held in England in 1912 and thereafter every four years. The reservations of the counties that there would be too much cricket were quelled by a deal whereby they would all be guaranteed lucrative tour matches against both visiting sides. In 1909 the plan was most attractive. England and Australia were evenly matched, and South Africa were growing in strength and had won their most recent home series against England (in 1905-06) 4-1 - they were to win the 1909-10 series 3-2 - and had performed well in England in 1907 thanks to their phalanx of legspinners. But in the February of 1912, the simmering dispute between several leading Australian players and the recently formed Australian Cricket Board spilled over into open warfare. At a meeting of the selectors ahead of the fourth Test at Sydney, Clem Hill, Australia's captain, came to blows with a colleague, Peter McAllister. Underlying the animosity was the question of who should have the right to appoint the tour manager for the 1912 trip. The players, nominal amateurs for whom the trip was a real money-spinner, thought they should, while the board, realising that there was cash to be made, thought it should. The end result was that the board won through and six leading players - Hill, Warwick Armstrong, Victor Trumper, Tibby Cotter, Hanson Carter and Vernon Ransford - refused to tour. The South Africans had problems of their own. Their earlier success had come largely thanks to their battery of legspinners and googly bowlers who, on the matting wickets then used in South Africa, were lethal. But batsmen were becoming more used to playing the relatively-new googlies, and on English turf wickets the spinners' effectiveness was even further reduced. The third crucial factor was the weather. A soggy spring in 1912 was followed by one of the wettest summers since records began in 1766. In June, July and August, rainfall was more than double the annual average, and to add to the misery, August also went into the record books as the coldest, dullest and wettest month of the twentieth 20th century. If Australia's lack of depth on the field was a worry, the squad's off-field antics were even more remarkable. The post-tour report by George Crouch, the board-appointed manager, spoke of bad language, poor manners and heavy drinking. Even the usually conservative Wisden was taken to observe that \"some of the players were not satisfied with Crouch as manager\", while adding he claimed some of the team had behaved so badly that the side was \"socially ostracised\". It was hardly surprising that the Australians' income from the tour was 40% down on their previous trip in 1909. Even England had problems, with CB Fry's idiosyncratic captaincy openly criticised in the media. But the weakness of the opposition, allied to the strength in depth of the side and familiarity with the conditions, meant the tournament was a fairly one-sided affair. May 28 was a day to remember for Jimmy Matthews ... not just one hat-trick but two! © Wisden Cricket Monthly Australia started well with a crushing innings victory over South Africa in the tournament opener at Old Trafford, notable for Victoria's legspinner Jimmy Matthews uniquely taking a hat-trick in each innings (on the same day). England then eased to an equally comprehensive innings win over the South Africans at Lord's. Then the weather closed in. Only four hours' play was possible on the first two days of the first Test between England and Australia at Lord's, and as all the matches were over three days, that ruled out any meaningful contest. The second meeting of the two sides at Old Trafford was even worse hit, and although there was some play, Fry complained that the pitch was \"pure mud\". England eased to a second win over South Africa at Manchester, and in front of desultory crowds at Lord's, Australia beat them as well by 10 wickets. One of the few who attended that match was King George V, the first time a reigning monarch had seen Test cricket. The final round of matches was just as uncompetitive. At The Oval, England polished off South Africa before lunch on the second day, with SF Barnes grabbing 8 for 29 inside 90 minutes. In the only match at Trent Bridge , appalling weather enabled South Africa to avoid a tournament whitewash in their final match against Aussies. The series decider came at The Oval, where it was agreed that the match would be played to a finish - the organisers had forgotten a tiebreaker in the event of two sides finishing with the same number of wins and so a definite result was needed. The first day was sunny, but a wet outfield meant that Fry was unwilling to start promptly and play didn't get underway until midway through the afternoon. The crowd vented their feelings by booing Fry all the way to the middle when he came out to bat. Less than 90 minutes' play was possible on both the second and third days, but on the third Australia lost eight wickets for 21 runs on a \"pitch better suited to water polo\". They never recovered, and England won the match, the tournament and The Ashes. It was fairly apparent that the experiment had not been a success, with the weather and public antipathy the crucial factors. \"Nine Tests provide a surfeit of cricket,\" observed The Daily Telegraph, \"and contests between Australia and South Africa are not a great attraction to the British public.\" Wisden concluded that \"the experiment is not likely to be repeated for many years to come - perhaps not in this generation.\" Although the idea was not officially shelved, it never resurfaced after the First World War. It was to be another 63 years before a multi-national tournament was held again and that - the 1975 World Cup - was an altogether more successful affair ... helped by one of the hottest summers of the century.

Keen to boost income, the region's three big teams - Bangladesh were two years from getting Test status - would all meet and India and Pakistan's resumption of cricketing relations removed the last and most significant obstacle to the event.Even before the start the Championship was threatened by politicians as those from India and Pakistan postured and tried to use the cricket for their own purposes. In the end it was agreed the tour of India by Pakistan could go ahead, but only shortly before it was scheduled to start.The Calcutta Test in February 1999 was originally planned as the third and final match of the series between the two. But once the idea of the Asian Championship was accepted, it became the new tournament's inaugural game. The public showed their support and around 100,000 turned up on the first four days, and 65,000 on the fifth even though India had only four second-innings wickets left. The attendance smashed the 63-year-old record for the highest aggregate at a Test.However, the game was marred by crowd trouble and was, Wisden observed, completed in near silence, \"watched by a few officials, VIPs, journalists and police, after the crowd was forcibly expelled because of a riot\".The first three days passed without incident and, initially, India appeared to be on the way to a memorable victory as Pakistan slumped to 26 for 6 on the first morning. Led by Moin Khan's 70 they recovered to 185, and restricted India to a slender first-innings lead, although the crowd were left unsatisfied when Sachin Tendulkar was bowled by Shoaib Akhtar for a first-ball duck. The two were to cross swords again in the second innings.Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid wait for the third umpire's decision•Sajal Mukerjee/ESPNcricinfo LtdSuperb bowling from Javagal Srinath - he took 8 for 86 and 13 for 132 in the match - was matched by a brilliant innings from Saeed Anwar, who carried his bat for 188, as Pakistan made 316 second time around and set India a target of 279 with more than two days to get them.By the fourth afternoon India were well placed on 143 for 2 when there came the incident which turned the whole game ugly.Tendulkar, cheered to the rafters by a massive crowd when he came in, was on 7 when he clipped Wasim Akram to deep midwicket. He took two runs - completing 5000 Test runs in the process - and was on his way back for a third when substitute Nadeem Khan hit the stumps with his throw from the deep. In the ordinary course of events it was a straightforward third run even with the direct hit, but Tendulkar collided with Shoaib Akhtar, who was waiting close to the stumps to gather the return, and as a result was out of his ground, even though he may well have been just inside the crease at the moment of the collision. Steve Bucknor referred it to the third umpire, KT Francis, who, after a long delay, gave him out. This was the first series where all officials were neutral.Who was at fault very much depends on who you support. Shoaib was doing what any fielder would have done, taking position two or three yards behind the stumps to take the return, not going close up because there was no likely run-out opportunity. He was just off the cut strip and at no time appeared to even glance at the batsman, and in fact had his back to him. Tendulkar did not seem to see Shoaib and was watching the ball on its return flight, even moving slightly and inadvertently into Shoaib as he tried to run his bat in.The neutral's view seemed to be that it was a genuine accident, although in the Times, Richard Hobson was not sitting on the fence. \"Tendulkar could blame only himself for the dismissal… he kept his eye on the throw instead of his own route to the crease. Wasim Akram, the Pakistan captain, was under no obligation to withdraw the appeal.\"Tendulkar along with ICC boss Jagmohan Dalmiya attempts to quieten the crowd•Sajal Mukerjee/ESPNcricinfo LtdTendulkar headed off looking slightly bewildered and went straight to the TV umpires' room instead of the dressing room, to see the incident replayed. He said nothing but just shook his head unbelievingly as he reviewed the dismissal.Rahul Dravid blocked the final three balls of the over but then the huge crowd erupted at what was perceived as a gross injustice to their hero and started chanting \"cheat, cheat\", pelting Shoaib Akhtar with bottles and other objects as he returned to his position in the deep.Eventually the umpires took the players from the field for an early tea and it was only after personal pleas from Tendulkar and ICC president Jagmohan Dalmiya that the match was able to resume. \"It was good of Sachin to go out and pacify the crowd,\" said Dinesh Vajpal, Calcutta's chief of police. \"Fortunately we had not allowed spectators to bring in anything lethal.\"At the close, Dalmiya caused more than a few raised eyebrows when he claimed the trouble had been overblown. \"The crowd felt an injustice had been done, but there was no violence as such and within five minutes they held up placards saying they were sorry,\" he said. \"There were only 20 or so mischief-mongers and the rest of the crowd sorted the matter out themselves.\"The 67-minute delay affected India more than Pakistan. Within a few minutes of the resumption Dravid was dismissed by Shoaib, and when Mohammad Azhuruddin and Nayan Mongia fell within seven runs of each other near the end of the day, Pakistan were in the driving seat. By stumps, India needed 65 with four wickets in hand.Much depended on Sourav Ganguly, and after he fell to the ninth ball of the final day the mood in the crowd again turned ugly. When 20 minutes later Srinath was caught behind off Wasim Akram to leave India 231 for 9, Wisden reported: \"Spectators started burning newspapers in the stands and hurled stones, fruit and plastic bottles on to the field. The match was held up for over three hours as about 65,000 people were removed by police and security men. The crowd's anger was still concentrated on Tendulkar's run-out, but there was little viciousness in the riot; it was born of disappointment rather than anti-Pakistan feeling. There was no sign of violence outside the ground.\"The Calcutta police chase spectators out of the stadium to clear the stands on the fifth and final morning•Getty ImagesBut the Guardian was more critical of the police's tactics, saying they brought \"no credit to the game or its decision-makers… they chased fans up the alleyways and elderly men, women and children were ejected, if necessary by kicking, punching and beating with lathi sticks\".It only took Pakistan 10 balls to complete their 46-run win, but they did so in a surreal atmosphere, completely in contrast to the din that had accompanied everything that had gone before. Only about 200 people were left inside the concrete bowl, although one elderly couple had refused to budge, steadfastly asserting their right to remain and watch. They stayed until the team took to the field, at which point around 50 security guards pounced and manhandled them out of the stadium.Although the day before he had been one-eyed, the second far more serious disturbance rattled Dalmiya, who was angry and embarrassed. \"I exactly don't find any reason for provocation today,\" he said. \"The action is totally unjustified and uncalled for. The excitement of the crowd last evening was also too much. The spectators should learn that winning and losing is part of the game. Today's gesture was very clear that the last wicket would not be allowed to fall. I condemn today's action in strongest possible manner. Yesterday something happened in a spur of the moment but today there is no explanation.\"If that is the only motive of the spectators, that the visiting team shouldn't win here, I only leave it to the future and hope the God changes their [the crowd's] attitude.\"At the post-match press conference, Wasim Akram lambasted the Indian media for stoking up the unrest. \"Whatever has happened today, it is only because of you people and your reports. You have said that Shoaib obstructed Sachin from making his ground and I should have re-invited him to bat. Why should I do that? If a team fails for only one man, that is our bonus. The whole world saw none of them were responsible for the collision. But you have blamed me. Is that wise?\"You have held [the crowd] responsible for the whole wrong-doings, but I will never blame them for this because they were all pre-occupied with those reports, for which the saddest thing in Test cricket happened here today.\"The police go about their eviction duties on day five•Getty ImagesAzharuddin was much more downbeat. \"I don't want to say anything more because I've already said that in 1996, when we lost the World Cup semi-final to Sri Lanka by default. I just want them to behave, because every time we cannot win. We are also human beings and any day we can fail. This incident has let us down in the world of cricket, and I don't know why they did that.\"The great shame was that the match was a superb advertisement for Test cricket, even if the crowd's behaviour was not. But the next two games - Sri Lanka v India in Colombo and Pakistan v Sri Lanka in Lahore - were less so, and the final was woefully one-sided as Pakistan defeated Sri Lanka by an innings and 175 runs in Dhaka.Perhaps the last word should go to Dalmiya, who, after composing himself in the aftermath of the riots on the final day in Calcutta, cheerily told the media: \"The game was finished and cricket was the winner.\"The era of administrators genuinely out of touch with the real world and believing income was the be-all and end-all was with us.What happened next?

Keen to boost income, the region's three big teams - Bangladesh were two years from getting Test status - would all meet and India and Pakistan's resumption of cricketing relations removed the last and most significant obstacle to the event. Even before the start the Championship was threatened by politicians as those from India and Pakistan postured and tried to use the cricket for their own purposes. In the end it was agreed the tour of India by Pakistan could go ahead, but only shortly before it was scheduled to start. The Calcutta Test in February 1999 was originally planned as the third and final match of the series between the two. But once the idea of the Asian Championship was accepted, it became the new tournament's inaugural game. The public showed their support and around 100,000 turned up on the first four days, and 65,000 on the fifth even though India had only four second-innings wickets left. The attendance smashed the 63-year-old record for the highest aggregate at a Test. However, the game was marred by crowd trouble and was, Wisden observed, completed in near silence, \"watched by a few officials, VIPs, journalists and police, after the crowd was forcibly expelled because of a riot\". The first three days passed without incident and, initially, India appeared to be on the way to a memorable victory as Pakistan slumped to 26 for 6 on the first morning. Led by Moin Khan's 70 they recovered to 185, and restricted India to a slender first-innings lead, although the crowd were left unsatisfied when Sachin Tendulkar was bowled by Shoaib Akhtar for a first-ball duck. The two were to cross swords again in the second innings.

With an increasingly packed international calendar, the third staging of the Championship was postponed and then it was quietly abandoned in 2006 Wasim Akram called for a two-year ban on Tests at Eden Gardens; the next game was not staged there until March 2001 What happened next? Is there an incident from the past you would like to know more about? E-mail us with your comments and suggestions. Martin Williamson is managing editor of Cricinfo © ESPN Sports Media Ltd. @wolver, If you would bother to take time out to understand what the stats bases are actually telling you it may improve your \"general knowledge\". If you don't feel inclined to take the effort yourself please browse through several other blogs on the world xi...a lot of commentators have explained them....In any case your frustration and that of kiwirocker, etc is fully understandable. Tendulkar has now gone so far above all others besides the Don that certain folk are getting increasingly desperate to somehow bring him down. But you know what- Tendulkar isnt even done yet! so get ready for plenty more PAIN as the Maestro continues to get the runs and firmly plant himself in cricket history alongside the Don! LOL...all the best. @Kiwirocker & @Wolver - the stats game can be played from both sides of the fence and figures can be moulded to highlight facts as you wish. Every player has had some players against whom he hasn't fared well and some against whom he has done pretty well. The net balance is what makes one player a great and another not so much. For your Akram, Donald and McGrath one can throw in SRT's averages against Ambrose (57.58), Walsh (66.11) and Warne (60.45), each a great bowler. FYI Lara's averages against Donald and Akram are pretty similar to SRT's and higher in case of McGrath. That just goes to show that a great bowler cannot have great averages against all great batsmen, the same way that a great batsman cannot have great averages against all great bowlers. Another eg...\"2)On the other hand in matches \"including\" a bowler , if even another bowler has got the batsman in question..credit goes to all bowlers. So, for eg. ,in the 98 pak series akram did not get tendulkar out once...but he still gets credit in matched \"including\" akram...understand?...\".........Oh, by the way im sure you are aware that tendulkar has effectively again been voted in as the 2nd best batsman after Bradman on the world XI with 51 points (then richards 42, lara 28)......so, unless you and your dear friend kiwirocker know more than experts and ex captains who have watched cricket for 60 yrs.....this means you need to reexamine your knowledge of cricket...cheers @wolver...here's an eg from another blog. there's lots of egs out there...if only you would be bothered to look...which obviously you arent' coz it doesnt suit you ...\"1) For eg. in the 2000s lara \"averages\" 50 in matches \"including\" Flintoff. But his head-to-head( not \"averages\" as found on stats guru) vs. Flintoff in the 2000s is 20. Of course, we need entire career stats before judging ,but this is just an eg.The difference as you can see is a whopping 60%. The real problem is that at any point we don't know the quantum of difference involved,or even whether it is positive or negative…\"......... @ Rohan1 - '(coincidentally?) ' Don't know what you're implying but it is ridiculous and shows a very single minded mentality. Don't know if Kiwirocker's stats are exact but they are definitely close, check the stats on cric info. Of course you won't do this as it will bring some reality to your perception of Sachin. And no I don't post on every forum and this forum is definitely not soley for fanatical sachin supporters. If these fanatical supporters are going to post some crazy comments, you can't expect other readers to not challenge it. Finally let me add- All laws are made to \"ensure\" a \"fair\" judgement. It is only with a \"lawyer\" mentality that anyone can argue that what transpired was \"fair\"......no true cricket/sportsfan would ever argue that @Riyas Izzedeen...This is the problem. i.e You argue blindly on parochial or nationalistic grounds. Did you ppl even SEE the run out? Tendulkar had ALREADY grounded his bat IN the crease BEFORE the ball arrived....THEN he collided with Shoaib.....AFTER that the bat bounced up........and EVEN after that the ball hit the stumps......Never mind the high horse......By which act of sportsmanship or skill would you consider that out? Hundred percent agree with Meety. Kiwirocker should try to find another job its so dumb to blame the feilding sideall ST had to do was look where he was running. all batsmen do not walk and wicketkeepers constantly appeal for catched when the ball hit nothing so get off your high horse Rohan! @meety, kiwirocker......etc. well said meety. he has got a cut and paste job which he goes on ad infinitum and ad nausuem with..and then wolver just waiting in the wings (coincidentally?) jumps in. you see it on each and every blog. point is , as so many others have mentioned, they dont even know that they are using wrong stats or what info they are getting out of the stats bases.

In fact, the one-day circus had kicked off almost a year earlier, at an equally cold Grace Road in Leicester.The potential of a one-day knockout cup had already been discussed by English cricket's authorities, and a decision was made to run with the idea as an experiment in 1963. One of those party to the discussion was Mike Turner, the young and forward-looking Leicestershire secretary, and he came away from meetings at The Oval with the idea of hosting a dry run in 1962.A quick study of the fixture list showed that Leicestershire and three other local sides - Nottinghamshire, Northamptonshire and Derbyshire - were without matches on the first two Wednesdays of the season. Turner was given his committee's backing, and all three counties accepted his invitation to play in a four-county tournament.

There was also much sympathy for the captains, who, on top of bowling limitations, had to ensure that there were not more than five fieldsmen on the leg side or six on the off, and \"had to enliven their own thoughts and actions to keep up with the increased pace of the game\".The poor weather was still hanging around for the final, which was also at Grace Road.

Sunil Gavaskar, who scored an unbeaten 174-ball 36, later claimed that he thought the target was unachievable and decided to take some match practice. First hit-wicket in ODIs In the 1975 World Cup final, West Indies opener Roy Fredricks lost balance and kicked the leg stump with his left leg after hooking a Dennis Lillee bouncer. Agonisingly, the ball went for a six over long-leg, but Fredricks became the first player to be out hit-wicket in ODI history. A jaw-dropping shot During the 1979 World Cup final, with no field restrictions, England captain Mike Brearley sent all his fielders deep to protect the boundary. However, Viv Richards, on 132, anticipated a full ball, moved to the off-side and played a stylish flick to send it all the way and took the cricketing world by surprise. Recalling the moment, Richards later said, \"That shot is my invention.\" A captain agrees to change a four to six and his team lose by 1 run When Dean Jones lofted Maninder Singh over mid-off during a 1987 World Cup match in Madras, the umpire, who was unsure if the ball had crossed the boundary, took Ravi Shastri's word and signalled four. However, Jones walked up to umpire Dickie Bird and suggested that it was a six. Dickie then said that the issue would be discussed after Australia's innings. During the innings break, Australian team manager Alan Crompton spoke to the umpires, who then approached India's captain, Kapil Dev. A generous Kapil agreed to change that four to six, which meant India's new target would be 271. Interestingly, India went on to lose the match by 1 run. When Courtney Walsh became Courteous Walsh Pakistan needed 2 runs to win off the last ball in a 1987 World Cup group match at Lahore. Despite the non-striker backing up too much, Courtney Walsh, who was in charge of the last over, liberally refused to effect a run-out. Eventually, Abdul Qadir hit the winning runs and Pakistan won the match by 1 wicket. First player to play for two countries in ODIs Kepler Wessels became the first player to represent two countries in ODI history. He played for Australia from 1982 to 1985, before representing South Africa in 1991. Despite local outrage, Wessels was controversially named as South Africa's captain for the 1992 World Cup. A captain who returned from retirement to win a World Cup Pakistan's World Cup winning captain Imran Khan returned to international cricket in 1988 after announcing his retirement the previous year. It was at the request of the Pakistani President, General Zia-Ul-Haq, that the all-rounder represented the country again. Eventually, his inspirational captaincy gave Pakistan their first World Cup. Angry fans set Eden Gardens ablaze Sachin Tendulkar's dismissal in the 1996 World Cup semifinal triggered a tremendous collapse as India slumped from 98/1 to 120/8. An outrageous crowd then went berserk at the Eden Gardens setting fire in the stands and throwing bottles onto the field. This forced the match officials to stop the match and declare Sri Lanka as winners by default. Umpires ask Cronje to remove ear piece used for communicating with coach During South Africa's 1999 World Cup opener against India, captain Hansie Cronje and Allan Donald wore ear pieces to get instructions from their coach Bob Woolmer. India's Sourav Ganguly noticed Cronje talking to himself and referred the case to the on-field umpires, who then asked both Cronje and Donald to remove the equipment after consulting with the match referee. However, the act was not considered to be against the laws of the game. A review that changed the DRS rule India's review against Ian Bell in the 2011 World Cup forced the International Cricket Council (ICC) to change the DRS rule. Although Hawk-Eye showed the ball hitting a good part of the stumps, Bell was not given out as he was struck outside 2.5 metres from the stumps. The ICC then changed the rule by saying a batsman can be ruled out, if the Hawk-Eye shows the ball hitting the stumps, by a considerable margin, irrespective of the distance between the point of impact and the stumps.

But their claims for more recognition were further boosted when, three days before the final, they beat India at Old Trafford in the World Cup. The only blemish was their refusal to play Israel on political grounds, but they qualified from their group for the semi-finals by virtue of a faster run-rate, where they beat Denmark. The other semi-final produced an upset as Bermuda were defeated by Canada, who had only qualified for the last four as best runners-up of the three groups. The final was one-sided as Sri Lanka rattled up 324 for 8, although Canada battled well in reaching 264 for 5 in reply. 1982 Venue England Winner Zimbabwe Runner-up Bermuda With holders Sri Lanka having moved up to join the big boys, the second ICC Trophy was more of an open race. Again held in the Midlands, appalling weather blighted the tournament, ironic in the light of the organisers’ decision to move the event from May to June to ensure better weather. Four sides – USA, Gibraltar, Singapore and West Africa – had four games washed out. Zimbabwe and Bermuda, the favourites, emerged from their groups with 100& records and some outstanding performances. Zimbabwe trounced USA by 191 runs after Dave Houghton and Kevin Curran had scored hundreds in their 332 for 4; Bermuda went one better, smashing 348 for 9 against Malaysia in a 284-run win. The surprise package were Papua New Guinea, who beat the fancied Canadians by 20 runs to go through to the semi-finals, where Bangladesh completed the line-up with a win over Holland. Both semis were one-sided affairs, Zimbabwe bowled Bangaldesh out for 124 and passing that for the loss of two wickets, and Bermuda beating Papua New Guinea, who won the third-place play-off, by six wickets. But the final was a good contest. Bermuda made 231 for 8, Duncan Fletcher the pick of the bowlers with 3 for 34, and then Andy Pycroft’s 82 helping them to a five-wicket win with six overs to spare. Zimbabwe qualified for the 1983 World Cup finals. 1986 Venue England Winner Zimbabwe Runner-up Holland Teams 16 Format Two groups, one of seven one of nine, top two into semi-finals In contrast to 1982, the third ICC Trophy was played in good weather with only the final at Lord’s affected to any degree, the game spilling over into a second day after a four-hour rain delay. Again Midlands-based, the fine conditions favoured the batsmen. Simon Myles (Hong Kong) smacked a record 172 on the opening day of the tournament, one of 20 hundreds, and Papua New Guinea amassed 455 for 9 against Gibraltar (on the same day Holland made 425 for 4 against Israel). But there were few surprises in the results. Zimbabwe powered through their group unbeaten, while Holland, Bermuda and Demmark all reached the last four. In a repeat of the 1982 final, Zimbabwe crushed Bermuda by 10 wickets, Grant Paterson (123*) and Robin Brown (81*) putting on 205 in 38.5 overs, while the other semi was won by Holland, whose five-wicket over Denmark was largely thanks to 127 not out from Guyanese-born Rupert Gomes. The final, for which Holland brought more than 1000 spectators, was a good game. Zimbabwe posted 243 for 9, a good recovery from 101 for 4 in an innings which the rain delay robbed of momentum. Brown played the anchor with a 51-over 61, while Andy Waller injected much-needed acceleration at the end. Holland looked in a strong position on 109 for 1 after 30 overs before they lost five wickets for 30. They remained in the hunt until Steve Lubbers seriously damaged his ankle and had to retire, and the tail lacked the firepower to mount a serious challenge. 1990 Venue Holland Winner Zimbabwe Runner-up Holland Teams 17 Format Four groups, then two groups of four in the quarter-finals, top two into semi-finals The first sponsored tournament produced a repeat of the 1986 final, and again Zimbabwe triumphed over hosts Holland, in front of 3000 spectators at the HCC ground in the Hague, their well-paced chase being led by Andy Flower (69*). The early stages produced little remarkable, but it was apparent early on that Zimbabwe were a class apart. As expected, they eased into the final with an 84-run win over Bangladesh, while Holland beat Kenya thanks to P-J Baaker’s 6 for 41 (he had returned from county duty). 1993-94 Venue Kenya Winner UAE Runner-up Kenya Teams 16 Format Four groups, then two groups of four in the quarter-finals, top two into semi-finals The first tournament held outside Europe, and once again and open event with three-time winners Zimbabwe elevated to Test status. The start of the matches brought an end to a two-month drought, but thereafter the climate was ideal. The most contentious matter was the eligibility of players, the UAE attracting the most criticism as their squad of ex-pats contained only one home-grown cricketer – Sultan Zarawani, the captain. It was, in view of that, rather disappointing that they won the Trophy. The group stages produced little in terms of upsets, although group B was close, with two teams of ex-pats, the UAE and USA, battling with the home-grown Bangladeshis. The USA had the talent but lacked any discipline and they lost out. In the semi-finals, Kenya’s batting proved too much for Bermuda, their 318 for 5 led by Maurice Odumbe’s unbeaten 158, while UAE eased to a six-wicket win over Holland. Kenya seemed to have posted a winning total when they reached 281 for 6 in the final, Odumbe again top scoring with 86 and adding a hundred for the second successive match with Steve Tikolo. But UAE timed their chase to perfection, winning by two wickets with five balls in hand. Holland won the third-place play-off to book the third and final berth in the 1996 World Cup. 1997 Venue Malaysia Winner Bangladesh Runner-up Kenya Teams 16 Format Four groups, then two groups of four in the quarter-finals, top two into semi-finals The sixth ICC Trophy was bedeviled with problems, the most serious being that the Malaysians’ assurance that turf wickets would be in place was not fulfilled and so matches were played on artificial wickets. The outfields were also less than perfect, and overall the conditions were not up to the expected standard. To add to the difficulties, the weather was increasingly dreadful and one of the semi-finals, the third-place play-off and the final were all played over two days. On the field, the gulf between the big boys and the minnows was all too apparent, but Singapore came close to beating Kenya and Hong Kong beated Bermuda, one of the favourites, by three wickets. There was also a near-farcical protest when Islamic fundamentalists turned up to disrupt the Israel-Gibraltar game – the authorities had been tipped off and switched venues with the Canada-Holland tie, although the demonstrators refused to believe the authorities and started bonfires on the outfield causing the game to be abandoned. The quarter-finals onwards were disrupted by the weather, with Holland’s hopes hammered by a D/L loss to Hong Kong while other games were washed out. Kenya had an excellent half-century from Maurice Odumbe (who averaged 98.60) to thank for bailing them out after Ireland had them tied down, and then Ireland came within seven runs of beating them. In the other match, Scotland were well beaten by Bangladesh, whose large traveling support gave them excellent support. Kenya looked likely winners of the two-day final, with the previously out-of-form Steve Tikolo hammering 147 and adding 138 for the fourth wicket with Odumbe (43) as they reached 241 for 7. But rain and D/L reduced Bangladesh’s target to 166 in 25 overs. The chase was frantic, and they started the last over needing 11 with two wickets in hand. It all came down to the last ball, and Hasibul Hussain missed but scrambled a leg-bye. The third-place play-off, which decided the third qualifier for the 1999 World Cup, was won fairly comfortably by Scotland. 2001 Venue Canada Winner Holland Runner-up Namibia Teams 22 Format Four groups, then a Super League, top two into final The largest competition yet – even allowing for the late withdrawal of Italy and West Africa – with a new format involving a Super League. As was to prove the case in the main World Cup two years later, the early matches were often one-sided, and the system of carrying forward points to the second stage was far from popular and gave the two group winners – Holland and Namibia – a distinct advantage, although Scotland ran them close. In fairness, Namibia were the surprise package, and only when they met Holland in the final did their inexperience show. In a low-scoring match, Holland were 106 for 6 with 13 over remaining, chasing 196, but a 51-ball 58 not out from Jacob-Jan Esmeijer guided them to a two-wicket victory off the last ball. Scotland, who had effectively thrown away their final Super League match, were livid that third place in that had not secured them an automatic World Cup berth, were soundly beaten by Canada in the play-off. A brief history A result of the success of the inaugural 1975 World Cup, the ICC trophy was launched for all ICC Associate members in 1979 and the first tournament ran ahead of the main World Cup, with the finalists offered the additional prize of being included in the competition proper. 1979 Venue England Winner Sri Lanka Runner-up Canada As widely expected, Sri Lanka, pushing hard for Test status, won the competition, which was based at club grounds across the Midlands, although they were indebted to their depth of batting as their bowling was generally weak.

The final, for which Holland brought more than 1000 spectators, was a good game. Zimbabwe posted 243 for 9, a good recovery from 101 for 4 in an innings which the rain delay robbed of momentum. Brown played the anchor with a 51-over 61, while Andy Waller injected much-needed acceleration at the end. Holland looked in a strong position on 109 for 1 after 30 overs before they lost five wickets for 30. They remained in the hunt until Steve Lubbers seriously damaged his ankle and had to retire, and the tail lacked the firepower to mount a serious challenge. 1990 Venue Holland Winner Zimbabwe Runner-up Holland Teams 17 Format Four groups, then two groups of four in the quarter-finals, top two into semi-finals The first sponsored tournament produced a repeat of the 1986 final, and again Zimbabwe triumphed over hosts Holland, in front of 3000 spectators at the HCC ground in the Hague, their well-paced chase being led by Andy Flower (69*). The early stages produced little remarkable, but it was apparent early on that Zimbabwe were a class apart. As expected, they eased into the final with an 84-run win over Bangladesh, while Holland beat Kenya thanks to P-J Baaker’s 6 for 41 (he had returned from county duty). 1993-94 Venue Kenya Winner UAE Runner-up Kenya Teams 16 Format Four groups, then two groups of four in the quarter-finals, top two into semi-finals The first tournament held outside Europe, and once again and open event with three-time winners Zimbabwe elevated to Test status. The start of the matches brought an end to a two-month drought, but thereafter the climate was ideal. The most contentious matter was the eligibility of players, the UAE attracting the most criticism as their squad of ex-pats contained only one home-grown cricketer – Sultan Zarawani, the captain. It was, in view of that, rather disappointing that they won the Trophy. The group stages produced little in terms of upsets, although group B was close, with two teams of ex-pats, the UAE and USA, battling with the home-grown Bangladeshis. The USA had the talent but lacked any discipline and they lost out. In the semi-finals, Kenya’s batting proved too much for Bermuda, their 318 for 5 led by Maurice Odumbe’s unbeaten 158, while UAE eased to a six-wicket win over Holland. Kenya seemed to have posted a winning total when they reached 281 for 6 in the final, Odumbe again top scoring with 86 and adding a hundred for the second successive match with Steve Tikolo. But UAE timed their chase to perfection, winning by two wickets with five balls in hand. Holland won the third-place play-off to book the third and final berth in the 1996 World Cup. 1997 Venue Malaysia Winner Bangladesh Runner-up Kenya Teams 16 Format Four groups, then two groups of four in the quarter-finals, top two into semi-finals The sixth ICC Trophy was bedeviled with problems, the most serious being that the Malaysians’ assurance that turf wickets would be in place was not fulfilled and so matches were played on artificial wickets. The outfields were also less than perfect, and overall the conditions were not up to the expected standard. To add to the difficulties, the weather was increasingly dreadful and one of the semi-finals, the third-place play-off and the final were all played over two days. On the field, the gulf between the big boys and the minnows was all too apparent, but Singapore came close to beating Kenya and Hong Kong beated Bermuda, one of the favourites, by three wickets. There was also a near-farcical protest when Islamic fundamentalists turned up to disrupt the Israel-Gibraltar game – the authorities had been tipped off and switched venues with the Canada-Holland tie, although the demonstrators refused to believe the authorities and started bonfires on the outfield causing the game to be abandoned. The quarter-finals onwards were disrupted by the weather, with Holland’s hopes hammered by a D/L loss to Hong Kong while other games were washed out. Kenya had an excellent half-century from Maurice Odumbe (who averaged 98.60) to thank for bailing them out after Ireland had them tied down, and then Ireland came within seven runs of beating them. In the other match, Scotland were well beaten by Bangladesh, whose large traveling support gave them excellent support. Kenya looked likely winners of the two-day final, with the previously out-of-form Steve Tikolo hammering 147 and adding 138 for the fourth wicket with Odumbe (43) as they reached 241 for 7. But rain and D/L reduced Bangladesh’s target to 166 in 25 overs. The chase was frantic, and they started the last over needing 11 with two wickets in hand. It all came down to the last ball, and Hasibul Hussain missed but scrambled a leg-bye. The third-place play-off, which decided the third qualifier for the 1999 World Cup, was won fairly comfortably by Scotland. 2001 Venue Canada Winner Holland Runner-up Namibia Teams 22 Format Four groups, then a Super League, top two into final The largest competition yet – even allowing for the late withdrawal of Italy and West Africa – with a new format involving a Super League. As was to prove the case in the main World Cup two years later, the early matches were often one-sided, and the system of carrying forward points to the second stage was far from popular and gave the two group winners – Holland and Namibia – a distinct advantage, although Scotland ran them close. In fairness, Namibia were the surprise package, and only when they met Holland in the final did their inexperience show. In a low-scoring match, Holland were 106 for 6 with 13 over remaining, chasing 196, but a 51-ball 58 not out from Jacob-Jan Esmeijer guided them to a two-wicket victory off the last ball. Scotland, who had effectively thrown away their final Super League match, were livid that third place in that had not secured them an automatic World Cup berth, were soundly beaten by Canada in the play-off. 1979 Venue England Winner Sri Lanka Runner-up Canada As widely expected, Sri Lanka, pushing hard for Test status, won the competition, which was based at club grounds across the Midlands, although they were indebted to their depth of batting as their bowling was generally weak. But their claims for more recognition were further boosted when, three days before the final, they beat India at Old Trafford in the World Cup. The only blemish was their refusal to play Israel on political grounds, but they qualified from their group for the semi-finals by virtue of a faster run-rate, where they beat Denmark. The other semi-final produced an upset as Bermuda were defeated by Canada, who had only qualified for the last four as best runners-up of the three groups. The final was one-sided as Sri Lanka rattled up 324 for 8, although Canada battled well in reaching 264 for 5 in reply. 1982 Venue England Winner Zimbabwe Runner-up Bermuda With holders Sri Lanka having moved up to join the big boys, the second ICC Trophy was more of an open race. Again held in the Midlands, appalling weather blighted the tournament, ironic in the light of the organisers’ decision to move the event from May to June to ensure better weather. Four sides – USA, Gibraltar, Singapore and West Africa – had four games washed out. Zimbabwe and Bermuda, the favourites, emerged from their groups with 100& records and some outstanding performances. Zimbabwe trounced USA by 191 runs after Dave Houghton and Kevin Curran had scored hundreds in their 332 for 4; Bermuda went one better, smashing 348 for 9 against Malaysia in a 284-run win. The surprise package were Papua New Guinea, who beat the fancied Canadians by 20 runs to go through to the semi-finals, where Bangladesh completed the line-up with a win over Holland. Both semis were one-sided affairs, Zimbabwe bowled Bangaldesh out for 124 and passing that for the loss of two wickets, and Bermuda beating Papua New Guinea, who won the third-place play-off, by six wickets. But the final was a good contest. Bermuda made 231 for 8, Duncan Fletcher the pick of the bowlers with 3 for 34, and then Andy Pycroft’s 82 helping them to a five-wicket win with six overs to spare. Zimbabwe qualified for the 1983 World Cup finals. 1986 Venue England Winner Zimbabwe Runner-up Holland Teams 16 Format Two groups, one of seven one of nine, top two into semi-finals In contrast to 1982, the third ICC Trophy was played in good weather with only the final at Lord’s affected to any degree, the game spilling over into a second day after a four-hour rain delay. Again Midlands-based, the fine conditions favoured the batsmen. Simon Myles (Hong Kong) smacked a record 172 on the opening day of the tournament, one of 20 hundreds, and Papua New Guinea amassed 455 for 9 against Gibraltar (on the same day Holland made 425 for 4 against Israel). But there were few surprises in the results. Zimbabwe powered through their group unbeaten, while Holland, Bermuda and Demmark all reached the last four. In a repeat of the 1982 final, Zimbabwe crushed Bermuda by 10 wickets, Grant Paterson (123*) and Robin Brown (81*) putting on 205 in 38.5 overs, while the other semi was won by Holland, whose five-wicket over Denmark was largely thanks to 127 not out from Guyanese-born Rupert Gomes.

On the field, the gulf between the big boys and the minnows was all too apparent, but Singapore came close to beating Kenya and Hong Kong beated Bermuda, one of the favourites, by three wickets. There was also a near-farcical protest when Islamic fundamentalists turned up to disrupt the Israel-Gibraltar game – the authorities had been tipped off and switched venues with the Canada-Holland tie, although the demonstrators refused to believe the authorities and started bonfires on the outfield causing the game to be abandoned. The quarter-finals onwards were disrupted by the weather, with Holland’s hopes hammered by a D/L loss to Hong Kong while other games were washed out. Kenya had an excellent half-century from Maurice Odumbe (who averaged 98.60) to thank for bailing them out after Ireland had them tied down, and then Ireland came within seven runs of beating them. In the other match, Scotland were well beaten by Bangladesh, whose large traveling support gave them excellent support. Kenya looked likely winners of the two-day final, with the previously out-of-form Steve Tikolo hammering 147 and adding 138 for the fourth wicket with Odumbe (43) as they reached 241 for 7. But rain and D/L reduced Bangladesh’s target to 166 in 25 overs. The chase was frantic, and they started the last over needing 11 with two wickets in hand. It all came down to the last ball, and Hasibul Hussain missed but scrambled a leg-bye. The third-place play-off, which decided the third qualifier for the 1999 World Cup, was won fairly comfortably by Scotland. 2001 Venue Canada Winner Holland Runner-up Namibia Teams 22 Format Four groups, then a Super League, top two into final The largest competition yet – even allowing for the late withdrawal of Italy and West Africa – with a new format involving a Super League. As was to prove the case in the main World Cup two years later, the early matches were often one-sided, and the system of carrying forward points to the second stage was far from popular and gave the two group winners – Holland and Namibia – a distinct advantage, although Scotland ran them close. In fairness, Namibia were the surprise package, and only when they met Holland in the final did their inexperience show. In a low-scoring match, Holland were 106 for 6 with 13 over remaining, chasing 196, but a 51-ball 58 not out from Jacob-Jan Esmeijer guided them to a two-wicket victory off the last ball. Scotland, who had effectively thrown away their final Super League match, were livid that third place in that had not secured them an automatic World Cup berth, were soundly beaten by Canada in the play-off. 1993-94 Venue Kenya Winner UAE Runner-up Kenya Teams 16 Format Four groups, then two groups of four in the quarter-finals, top two into semi-finals The first tournament held outside Europe, and once again and open event with three-time winners Zimbabwe elevated to Test status. The start of the matches brought an end to a two-month drought, but thereafter the climate was ideal. The most contentious matter was the eligibility of players, the UAE attracting the most criticism as their squad of ex-pats contained only one home-grown cricketer – Sultan Zarawani, the captain. It was, in view of that, rather disappointing that they won the Trophy. The group stages produced little in terms of upsets, although group B was close, with two teams of ex-pats, the UAE and USA, battling with the home-grown Bangladeshis. The USA had the talent but lacked any discipline and they lost out. In the semi-finals, Kenya’s batting proved too much for Bermuda, their 318 for 5 led by Maurice Odumbe’s unbeaten 158, while UAE eased to a six-wicket win over Holland. Kenya seemed to have posted a winning total when they reached 281 for 6 in the final, Odumbe again top scoring with 86 and adding a hundred for the second successive match with Steve Tikolo. But UAE timed their chase to perfection, winning by two wickets with five balls in hand. Holland won the third-place play-off to book the third and final berth in the 1996 World Cup. 1997 Venue Malaysia Winner Bangladesh Runner-up Kenya Teams 16 Format Four groups, then two groups of four in the quarter-finals, top two into semi-finals The sixth ICC Trophy was bedeviled with problems, the most serious being that the Malaysians’ assurance that turf wickets would be in place was not fulfilled and so matches were played on artificial wickets. The outfields were also less than perfect, and overall the conditions were not up to the expected standard. To add to the difficulties, the weather was increasingly dreadful and one of the semi-finals, the third-place play-off and the final were all played over two days.

The extra matches also forced reserve days to be scrapped, even though the competition was being held late in South Africa's cricketing year, resulting in two washouts, which effectively eliminated Pakistan and West Indies. The experiment with Hawk-Eye, trialled in the Champions Trophy a few months earlier, was not continued. Relay throwing made its first appearance.Early running The competition began with a tense game between South Africa and West Indies. At the time, the hosts' defeat looked a mere hiccup; a ridiculous miscalculation in their final group game meant it contributed to their exit, with a resulting tailing off in local interest. Canada briefly enlivened proceedings when they beat Bangladesh, although Bangladesh's performances underlined how poor a side they were. Kenya qualified for the Super Sixes courtesy of a forfeit when New Zealand refused to play in Nairobi. Zimbabwe progressed thanks to England's boycott of Harare and the points they got in the abandoned match against Pakistan, but their every move was overshadowed by internal politics.Super Six Australia were all but guaranteed a semi-final berth before they started, while Kenya and Sri Lanka only had to beat Zimbabwe to do the same. India joined those three with convincing wins in all their matches. But while the presence of two minnows pleased neutrals, the absence of many big names, including the hosts, meant a number games were played in front of empty stands.Teams 14Games 52 (two forfeited)Hosts South Africa, Zimbabwe and KenyaVenues 15Format Two groups of seven, top three from each go to Super Sixes, from which semi-finalists are chosenWinners Australia; Runners-up IndiaMan of the Series Sachin TendulkarPrize money Total US$4.6m, Winners $2m, Runners-up $800,000Attendance 626, 845The semis India were never going to slip against a keen but limited Kenyan side, especially in front of a capacity crowd that outnumbered the Africans by about 100 to one. Sourav Ganguly hit a hundred and from then on the players did little more than go through the motions. Australia survived uneasy moments to see off Sri Lanka, with Brett Lee restoring the world order after Australia had limped to 212 for 7. Although rain ended the game early, the result had long since been known.The final It was as one-sided as the final in 1999. So savage was the attack led by Ricky Ponting (140 not out off 121 balls), with support from Damien Martyn and Adam Gilchrist, that Australia were never under threat. Sourav Ganguly went down guns blazing, and a rain break, preceded by Ponting desperately asking his spinners to race through overs to ensure a result, did briefly stir the crowd. Australia were deserved winners, and unlike in 1999, they dominated throughout. Michael Bevan collected his second winner's medal without having to bat or bowl in either final.Controversies Shane Warne was sent home before Australia's campaign began after testing positive for a diuretic and was later banned for a year. There was a dispute between the BCCI and its players, over product endorsement, and the ICC withheld India's share of revenue until the problem was resolved. New Zealand's board refused to let its team play in Nairobi because of recent terrorist activities, while it was left to England's players to take a stand not to play in Zimbabwe on \"moral, political and contractual\" grounds. Andy Flower and Henry Olonga protested against the Robert Mugabe regime by sporting black armbands \"mourning the death of democracy\" in \"beloved Zimbabwe\".This article was first published in 2014ICC World Cup Matches (11) Matches (11) (11) SL v PAK (1) SL v PAK (1) (1) SA-W in ENG (1) SA-W in ENG (1) (1) County DIV1 (5) County DIV1 (5) (5) County DIV2 (3) County DIV2 (3) (3) TNPL (1) TNPL (1) (1) Live • 2nd TEST • Galle • 2nd TEST (15.1 ov) & Day 3 - Session 2: Sri Lanka lead by 206 runs.

But while the presence of two minnows pleased neutrals, the absence of many big names, including the hosts, meant a number games were played in front of empty stands. The semis India were never going to slip against a keen but limited Kenyan side, especially in front of a capacity crowd that outnumbered the Africans by about 100 to one. Sourav Ganguly hit a hundred and from then on the players did little more than go through the motions. Australia survived uneasy moments to see off Sri Lanka, with Brett Lee restoring the world order after Australia had limped to 212 for 7. Although rain ended the game early, the result had long since been known. The final It was as one-sided as the final in 1999. So savage was the attack led by Ricky Ponting (140 not out off 121 balls), with support from Damien Martyn and Adam Gilchrist, that Australia were never under threat. Sourav Ganguly went down guns blazing, and a rain break, preceded by Ponting desperately asking his spinners to race through overs to ensure a result, did briefly stir the crowd. Australia were deserved winners, and unlike in 1999, they dominated throughout. Michael Bevan collected his second winner's medal without having to bat or bowl in either final. Controversies Shane Warne was sent home before Australia's campaign began after testing positive for a diuretic and was later banned for a year. There was a dispute between the BCCI and its players, over product endorsement, and the ICC withheld India's share of revenue until the problem was resolved. New Zealand's board refused to let its team play in Nairobi because of recent terrorist activities, while it was left to England's players to take a stand not to play in Zimbabwe on \"moral, political and contractual\" grounds. Andy Flower and Henry Olonga protested against the Robert Mugabe regime by sporting black armbands \"mourning the death of democracy\" in \"beloved Zimbabwe\".

Zaheer, deposited into the second tier of the stand at the Golf Course End by Ponting off the penultimate ball of the innings, finished with none for 67 from seven overs. Gilchrist dominated the early overs, hitting 57 off 48 balls before over-reaching on a slog-sweep at spinner Harbhajan Singh. Harbhajan also dismissed Hayden, caught behind for 37 edging at a ball that came across his body. But he was only brought back into the attack in time to see Ponting complete his half-century in the 39th over. India didn't give their fans much to shout about View from our man at the final And Ponting then hit the accelerator, smacking consecutive sixes off the spinner on the way to completing his second 50 in just 29 balls. India tried bravely to keep pace with a required run rate of 7.2 per over from the off. But man of the tournament Sachin Tendulkar lasted just four balls before lofting Glenn McGrath a return catch. The innings could have been cut down shortly afterwards had Brett Lee not over-stepped when he had Sehwag, on four at the time, caught at square leg. But Sehwag made the most of his let-off. After Ganguly mistimed Lee to mid-on for 24, Sehwag and Rahul Dravid added 88 for the fourth wicket in 13 overs, either side of a 25-minute break for rain. But the stand was brought to an abrupt halt when Lehmann's sharp throw from mid-off beat Sehwag as he scurried to add to his 82, which included 10 fours and three sixes. HAVE YOUR SAY Australia totally crushed India. They are a great team and deserve to be the champions From Tanya Khokhar, New York Join the debate Ponting stuck with his top for bowlers for as long as possible and as the pressure grew the wickets came. First was Dravid for 47, playing on to Bichel in an attempt to drive through the off-side. Having been dropped three times, Yuvraj Singh followed for 24, taken at midwicket off Hogg. And Martyn's spectacular diving catch to dismiss Dinesh Mongia effectively finished the contest in the 36th over, the first of two wickets for medium-pacer Andrew Symonds.

Pakistan were eliminated in their second game after contriving to lose by three wickets to Ireland, a result entirely overshadowed by the death hours later of Bob Woolmer their coach. The whole tournament was stunned and then thrown into doubt when Jamaica's police claimed he had been murdered. It turned out he had not, but things never recovered.

Australia thrashed South Africa who once again chocked, crashing to 27 for 5 before limping to 149 - Australia strolled home with 18 overs to spare.The final The best two sides made the final, but the farcical scenes at the end of the match summed up the utter shambles that almost everyone - other than the relentlessly upbeat ICC - knew the tournament had become. Adam Gilchrist thumped 149 off 104 balls - even that was shrouded in controversy as he admitted to using a squash ball inside his glove as an aid - as Australia scored 281 for 4 in a rain-reduced 38 overs. Sri Lanka chased gamely and while Kumar Sangakkara and Sanatah Jayasuriya added 116 for the second wicket they were in with a shout but they fell in quick succession and then farce descended in the gloom. The umpires left the field for bad light as Australia celebrated but then the officials, amid scenes with left cricket a laughing stock, brought the players back on.

Glenn McGrath went out on a high with a third winners medal and the man-of-the-Tournament award; Inzamam-ul-Haq went in tears after his dismissal against Zimbabwe, the pressure of the captaincy and Woolmer's death all too much; Lara might have felt like crying after being left high and dry by Marlon Samuels in front of a full house in Barbados.

It was overlong - a record 56 days - and the organisers managed to stage an event in the Caribbean and then do all they could to strip out every facet that makes watching the game there such fun. Overzealous security was again to the fore, ticket prices were silly - Barbados finally broke ranks, slashed the cost and were rewarded with full houses - complete idiocy meant that at some venues people had to walk long distances to get to games, and local business inflated their prices, and in many cases got burned.

Overzealous security was again to the fore, ticket prices were silly - Barbados finally broke ranks, slashed the cost and were rewarded with full houses - complete idiocy meant that at some venues people had to walk long distances to get to games, and local business inflated their prices, and in many cases got burned. The booing of local and ICC dignitaries at the final presentations told its own tale. But ultimately the ninth World Cup will be remembered for the death of Woolmer and the media hysteria which followed. Martin Williamson is executive editor of Cricinfo © ESPN EMEA Ltd.

Woolmer is not a first for me, I have been doing autopsies here [in Jamaica] since 1995.\"June 12 The Jamaica Constabulary Force (JCF) end weeks of speculation by confirming that Bob Woolmer died of natural causes on March 18 and was not murdered. South African and Canadian pathologists had concurred with a finding by a British forensics expert that \"Mr Woolmer died of natural causes,\" Lucius Thomas, the police commissioner, says. In further toxicology tests, \"no substance was found to indicate that Bob Woolmer was poisoned\".The Pakistan board expresses relief at the news. Nasim Ashraf, chairman of the board, tells Cricinfo that it is now time to move on and that there are unlikely to be any legal ramifications from this.Paul Condon, the head of the ICC's corruption-busting force, says said that people who linked Woolmer's death to match-fixing should now \"shut up.\"June 4 Pressure is growing on the pathologist whose post mortem led Jamaican police to launch a murder investigation to resign. And Mark Shields, the deputy commissioner of police, has slightly distanced himself from his findings. \"Usually we investigate a murder and we look for suspects but on this occasion, because of the lack of evidence to support the pathologist what we've done is gone out to prove it's not a murder,\" he told The Times. \"We have to go with what the pathologist gives, and if I'd ignored it and it had turned out to be true I would have been lambasted for not treating it seriously.\"June 3 Jamaican police decline to comment as it is widely reported they are set to make an embarrassing climbdown and admit that Woolmer died of natural causes. It is revealed that his family were told last month that there was uncertainty over how he died.June 2 According to reports in Daily Mail, Scotland Yard detectives have told Jamaican police that Woolmer was not murdered but died of natural causes. Police are expected to announce the findings later this week.May 23 The BBC dismisses a claim by Ehsan Qureshi, a Pakistani journalist, that its Panorama programme implied he was connected with the death of Woolmer. A spokesman said it was \"preposterous to suggest that anything in this a programme is defamatory of Mr Qureshi or has damaged his reputation in any way at all.\"May 20 Today's Sunday Times said that police in Jamaica have privately admitted that Dr Ere Seshaiah, the Kingston pathologist, was wrong to say that Woolmer had been strangled. But Seshaiah told the paper that he stood by his diagnosis that Woolmer was killed by \"asphyxia as a result of manual strangulation\". Nevertheless, the future of the investigation now seems to centre on the results of toxicology tests.May 14 As reports continue to circulate that the investigation will decide that Woolmer was not murdered, the Jamaica police again dismiss speculation as \"unhelpful\", adding that they were still undertaking a murder investigation : \"That will remain our position until such time as the results of the investigation are known; including the forensic and pathology analysis.\"May 13 Reports in The Sunday Telegraph say that the last email sent by Woolmer to the PCB could well be a fake as the language used was not consistent with his style. The Jamaica Gleaner carries a report which claims that there is evidence that Woolmer was not murdered.May 10 According to Pervez Mir, Pakistan's media manager during the World Cup, the two champagne bottles found in Woolmer's room were passed on to him by Mushtaq Ahmed, Pakistan's assistant coach, who had left them in his hotel roomMay 9 Jamaican police insist that they have credible evidence to suggest Woolmer was murdered as against reports of Pakistani investigators stating otherwise.May 8 A Pakistani investigator point to lack of evidence suggesting that Woolmer was murdered.May 7 A report in London's Sunday Times claims that there is evidence Woolmer was poisoned using weedkiller.May 5 The team of Pakistani investigators have finished their report on Woolmer's murder, the results of which are due to be presented today.May 4 Woolmer is cremated in a private ceremony, attended by his family, near to his home in Cape Town.April 30 A BBC TV investigation claims toxicology reports prove Woolmer was drugged.

Woolmer's body leaves Jamaica en route to South Africa.April 23 Jamaican government officials give permission for Woolmer's body to be released and taken back to his family in South Africa. Shields and the Kingston coroner Patrick Murphy agree to the move, according to a statement from the ministry of national security.April 22 A report in the Mail on Sunday quotes the Woolmer family as saying they have been told that police believe he was poisoned using a natural substance and that body tissue tests, which are the only way to establish that, are being undertaken in England.April 21 Pakistan Cricket Board officials deny receiving a request from police in Jamaica to send any Pakistani player there in connection with investigations. Indian TV had reported that players, including Inzamam-ul-Haq and Mushtaq Ahmed, had been summoned to Kingston.April 20 \"New and significant developments\" in the investigation delay the inquest that was due to start on Monday. A statement from the Jamaican justice ministry says the hearing will be postponed following advice from the coroner. \"The coroner wishes that these new and significant developments be pursued with the utmost urgency.\"April 19 Ireland's players end their World Cup adventure by giving statements, fingerprints and DNA samples to Jamaican police. \"These tests were carried out with a view to eliminating the Ireland squad from their enquiries,\" a team spokesman says. On the night Woolmer was murdered none of the Ireland squad was in the Pegasus Hotel in Jamaica. The players were celebrating St Patrick's Day and the victory over Pakistan in Ocho Rios, which is \"some 50 miles away\".April 17 Speculation that Woolmer was poisoned is resurrected by local newspapers in the Caribbean claiming to quote the toxicology report which states that samples taken from his blood, stomach and urine have shown the presence of a foreign substance. An unnamed government source says that this substance could have been poison.April 16 It is reported that police officers from Jamaica will visit Pakistan to quiz players over \"inconsistencies\" in statements.April 15 A report in the UK Sunday Times quotes police sources as saying that Woolmer was poisoned before being strangled.

Sources say that Patrick Murphy, the coroner for Kingston, will hold a full hearing, complete with live testimony from as many as a dozen witnesses who were in the process of being summoned to appear.April 9 Inzamam-ul-Haq said the World Cup would have been stopped if Woolmer's death had happened in any other country. The replacements for Woolmer and Inzamam as coach and captain will be discussed on Tuesday when the Pakistan Cricket Board's ad-hoc committee meets in Lahore. Inzamam told a parliamentary committee the World Cup defeats were part of cricket and he was \"hurt\" by match-fixing allegations.April 8 It wasn't a day for good news, with Mark Shields, the chief investigator, saying it may take another eight weeks to get the results of Woolmer's toxicology tests. The reports are crucial to proving whether Woolmer was poisoned or drugged and the delay means a quick end to the investigation is unlikely. \"It's in everyone's interest to know exactly when he died and how,\" Shields said. \"But frustrating as it may be, science goes at a certain pace.\" Apparently Woolmer's last meal was lasagne.April 7 Gill Woolmer has given permission for the publication of his book which will be published in September.April 6 Gill Woolmer says her husband did not mention match-fixing or being scared in his final emails. Mrs Woolmer, who did not want him to take the coaching position with Pakistan, thought the police were doing a \"good job\" but she wanted a \"speedy conclusion\" to the investigation. Woolmer was keeping a World Cup diary and planning to write a book about his time with Pakistan, but Mrs Woolmer said \"it is best if that book never appears now\". \"If it is going to cause upset, it is not worth publishing.\"April 5 No major developments in the case have emerged a day after the memorial service for Woolmer in Cape Town. Ian Chappell writes that Woolmer's murder ended any chance of his brother Greg continuing his role as India's coach. \"Such an ugly incident is sure to focus your concentration on life's priorities. Greg is probably better off without all the angst that comes with one of the most demanding jobs in cricket.\"April 4 Allan Donald says Woolmer \"lived for the game and succumbed to the game\" during a memorial service for his former coach in Cape Town. Donald also read a statement from Woolmer's widow Gill and her two sons while Tim Noakes, who co-authored a book with Woolmer, described him as a \"cricket missionary\". The Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Nasim Ashraf attended the service at the Wynberg high school and said: \"We in Pakistan loved Bob.\" Woolmer's body is still in Jamaica and there are reports it has been embalmed, which could make a second post-mortem difficult.April 3 Four Scotland Yard detectives were due in Jamaica on Tuesday and they should be joined by a high-profile Pakistani policeman in a growing list of assistants. Mir Zubair Mahmood, who successfully led the investigation into the murder of the US reporter Daniel Pearl, is due to travel to Jamaica with another Pakistan security official on Wednesday. \"It's a big, big responsibility on our shoulders and I hope we will be able to live up to the expectations,\" Zubair said. Interpol's Dr Susan Hitchen, a forensic expert in DNA analysis, has also arrived in Kingston to help the local police.April 2 Mark Shields, the chief investigator, says there is a possibility a poison was used to incapacitate Woolmer before his death. \"I have said from the beginning that if he was manually strangled, there are certain aspects that don't quite add up,\" Shields told AFP. Shields did not comment directly on a report that aconite had been used to kill Woolmer and said it was pointless speculating before the toxicology reports returned. In The Age there are concerns Jamaican bureaucracy will hold up the inquiry into Woolmer's death.Meanwhile Nasim Ashraf, the chairman of the Pakistan board, has confirmed that the Pakistani policeman who led the probe into the murder of US reporter Daniel Pearl will travel to Jamaica to help police investigating the death of cricket coach Woolmer Inzamam-ul-Haq lays a wreath during a memorial service for Woolmer in Lahore © AFP April 1 A memorial service is held for Woolmer in Lahore and Inzamam-ul-Haq was there with six of his team-mates. Four hundred mourners attended and they hear Woolmer was like a \"second father\" to the squad. \"After Woolmer's family, the Pakistan team was the most aggrieved by his death,\" Inzamam says during the hour-long service. The Jamaica Gleaner says a blood-stained pillow was found in Woolmer's room, but Mark Shields, the chief investigator, does not confirm the report. Media speculation intensifies with reports in some papers claiming he was poisoned with the herb aconite.March 31 More official cavalry is arriving in Jamaica with a team from Scotland Yard due to land in the next week after a request for help from the local police. Three detectives and a scenes of crime officer will make the trip to review the investigation into Woolmer's death. There will be even more foreign assistance in trying to track down the killers after Nasim Ashraf, the PCB chairman, says two Pakistan police officers will also travel to Kingston. Ashraf, who says no players were involved in the crime, will attend Woolmer's memorial service in South Africa on Wednesday. He also says the next coach will be a Pakistani and announces the players' contracts would be suspended.March 30 Pakistan has offered to send a three-person team to Jamaica to help with the investigation, following reports of dissatisfaction within Pakistan over how the case is proceeding. If approved by the Jamaican authorities, the group would likely include one PCB official, one diplomat and one senior investigative officer. A report in the Daily Telegraph also indicates the Jamaica police have requested a group of Scotland Yard detectives fly to Kingston to review the inquiry. Plans for a memorial service in Cape Town next Wednesday were also announced, with speakers to include Allan Donald.March 29 The time of Woolmer's death is still in doubt, but Mark Shields, the chief investigator, is certain he was murdered. He confirms again that Woolmer died due to manual strangulation, possibly with a towel. CCTV has revealed all the people who were on the 12th floor of the Pegasus Hotel, but police have to wait for an exact time of death before Shields can \"tie down when we should be looking at the tape\". Dr Ere Seshaiah, the pathologist who carried out the autopsy, is confident of his findings, despite questions arising about the manner of the death. In Pakistan a report from Reuters says the team was ordered to play the final group game against Zimbabwe or they would have been handed severe fines.March 28 Jamaica police dismiss speculation that there will be a second autopsy on Woolmer's body in a bid to quash media speculation that he might have died after hitting his head on the bathroom sink rather than have been murdered; that follows comments from an unnamed Pakistan board official who said: \"We believe that the autopsy by the pathologist may have had error counts and [the police] are now considering having a second autopsy to confirm the cause of death\".March 27 Jamaican police are reported to be searching for three mystery fans who they want to question; they also say that an examination of Woolmer's laptop shows no evidence of anything to do with match-fixing; Mark Shields, the deputy police commissioner, explains that the meal Woolmer had in his room is also being examined. \"We are looking at whether his food was drugged, the meal was thrown away after he put the tray outside his room, but we are conducting toxicology and tissue tests.\" Pakistan are officially eliminated from the police investigation into the murder.March 26 Pakistan start their long journey home, but not before police had again questioned three members of the group. A Pakistan official complains that the team have been kept in the dark over the investigation.March 25 As investigations continue, reports that the murder was related to match-fixing continue, Lord MacLaurin, the former head of the England board, launches a stinging attack on the way the ICC is run. Shaharyar M Khan - A gentle man, a superb coach News - Inzamam controlled the team, not WoolmerMarch 24 The police order an inquest. It emerges that Woolmer was preparing to write a book on his time as Pakistan coach, in addition to one he had just completed on coaching in general. A clearly emotional Pakistan side play their final match, beating Zimbabwe. News - Bob's loss hurts more than elimination - InzamamMarch 23 Speculation abounds, with match-fixing groups widely rumoured to be involved in the murder. There are calls for the \"World Cup to be cancelled, while others suggest the tournament is played in Woolmer's honour. The PCB reveal Woolmer had sent an email shortly before he died resigning as coach. The Pakistan side are questioned and undergo DNA testing as part of the routine enquiries. Officials deny the squad have been asked to stay on in Jamaica after their final game. Michael Vaughan, England's captain, admits he has a \"gut feeling\" that there is still corruption in the game. News - Woolmer had decided to retire News - Academy to be built in Woolmer's honour News - Musharraf honours WoolmerMarch 22 Police confirm that they have launched a murder investigation. \"The pathologist's report states that Mr Woolmer's death was due to asphyxiation as a result of manual strangulation,\" Karl Angell, a police spokesman, says. \"In these circumstances, the matter ... is now being treated by the Jamaica police as a case of murder.\"March 21 Shields reveals that Woolmer's death is now being treated as \"suspicious\" although he refuses to go further. Two Jamaican newspapers run headline stories claiming that a senior police source says Woolmer was murdered. News - Bob was more than a coach - RhodesMarch 20 The first autopsy is inconclusive and the pathologist asks for more tests before the cause of death can be identified. The police refuse to be drawn on rumblings in the media that there is more to the death than meets the eye: \"Any sudden death is treated as suspicious till we can say otherwise,\" says Mark Shields, Jamaica's deputy police commissioner.March 18 News filters through that Woolmer has been found unconscious in his hotel room, within hours it is confirmed that he has died.

June 13 Dr Ere Seshaiah, the pathologist who conducted the post mortem on Woolmer, defends his findings. \"I am sticking to my findings,\" he says. \"He was murdered. Woolmer is not a first for me, I have been doing autopsies here [in Jamaica] since 1995.\" June 12 The Jamaica Constabulary Force (JCF) end weeks of speculation by confirming that Bob Woolmer died of natural causes on March 18 and was not murdered. South African and Canadian pathologists had concurred with a finding by a British forensics expert that \"Mr Woolmer died of natural causes,\" Lucius Thomas, the police commissioner, says. In further toxicology tests, \"no substance was found to indicate that Bob Woolmer was poisoned\". The Pakistan board expresses relief at the news. Nasim Ashraf, chairman of the board, tells Cricinfo that it is now time to move on and that there are unlikely to be any legal ramifications from this. Paul Condon, the head of the ICC's corruption-busting force, says said that people who linked Woolmer's death to match-fixing should now \"shut up.\" June 4 Pressure is growing on the pathologist whose post mortem led Jamaican police to launch a murder investigation to resign. And Mark Shields, the deputy commissioner of police, has slightly distanced himself from his findings. \"Usually we investigate a murder and we look for suspects but on this occasion, because of the lack of evidence to support the pathologist what we've done is gone out to prove it's not a murder,\" he told The Times. \"We have to go with what the pathologist gives, and if I'd ignored it and it had turned out to be true I would have been lambasted for not treating it seriously.\" June 3 Jamaican police decline to comment as it is widely reported they are set to make an embarrassing climbdown and admit that Woolmer died of natural causes. It is revealed that his family were told last month that there was uncertainty over how he died. June 2 According to reports in Daily Mail, Scotland Yard detectives have told Jamaican police that Woolmer was not murdered but died of natural causes. Police are expected to announce the findings later this week. May 23 The BBC dismisses a claim by Ehsan Qureshi, a Pakistani journalist, that its Panorama programme implied he was connected with the death of Woolmer. A spokesman said it was \"preposterous to suggest that anything in this a programme is defamatory of Mr Qureshi or has damaged his reputation in any way at all.\" May 20 Today's Sunday Times said that police in Jamaica have privately admitted that Dr Ere Seshaiah, the Kingston pathologist, was wrong to say that Woolmer had been strangled. But Seshaiah told the paper that he stood by his diagnosis that Woolmer was killed by \"asphyxia as a result of manual strangulation\". Nevertheless, the future of the investigation now seems to centre on the results of toxicology tests. May 14 As reports continue to circulate that the investigation will decide that Woolmer was not murdered, the Jamaica police again dismiss speculation as \"unhelpful\", adding that they were still undertaking a murder investigation : \"That will remain our position until such time as the results of the investigation are known; including the forensic and pathology analysis.\" May 13 Reports in The Sunday Telegraph say that the last email sent by Woolmer to the PCB could well be a fake as the language used was not consistent with his style. The Jamaica Gleaner carries a report which claims that there is evidence that Woolmer was not murdered. May 10 According to Pervez Mir, Pakistan's media manager during the World Cup, the two champagne bottles found in Woolmer's room were passed on to him by Mushtaq Ahmed, Pakistan's assistant coach, who had left them in his hotel room May 9 Jamaican police insist that they have credible evidence to suggest Woolmer was murdered as against reports of Pakistani investigators stating otherwise. May 8 A Pakistani investigator point to lack of evidence suggesting that Woolmer was murdered. May 7 A report in London's Sunday Times claims that there is evidence Woolmer was poisoned using weedkiller. May 5 The team of Pakistani investigators have finished their report on Woolmer's murder, the results of which are due to be presented today. May 4 Woolmer is cremated in a private ceremony, attended by his family, near to his home in Cape Town. April 30 A BBC TV investigation claims toxicology reports prove Woolmer was drugged. It also reveals that there were deep religious divides within the squad. April 29 Woolmer's body arrives in Cape Town. April 26 Police rule out suggestions that snake venom was used on Woolmer, while Mark Shields hits out at \"wild\" rumours which he says are \"causing a lot of distress\" to the family. Woolmer's body leaves Jamaica en route to South Africa. April 23 Jamaican government officials give permission for Woolmer's body to be released and taken back to his family in South Africa. Shields and the Kingston coroner Patrick Murphy agree to the move, according to a statement from the ministry of national security. April 22 A report in the Mail on Sunday quotes the Woolmer family as saying they have been told that police believe he was poisoned using a natural substance and that body tissue tests, which are the only way to establish that, are being undertaken in England. April 21 Pakistan Cricket Board officials deny receiving a request from police in Jamaica to send any Pakistani player there in connection with investigations. Indian TV had reported that players, including Inzamam-ul-Haq and Mushtaq Ahmed, had been summoned to Kingston. April 20 \"New and significant developments\" in the investigation delay the inquest that was due to start on Monday. A statement from the Jamaican justice ministry says the hearing will be postponed following advice from the coroner. \"The coroner wishes that these new and significant developments be pursued with the utmost urgency.\" April 19 Ireland's players end their World Cup adventure by giving statements, fingerprints and DNA samples to Jamaican police. \"These tests were carried out with a view to eliminating the Ireland squad from their enquiries,\" a team spokesman says. On the night Woolmer was murdered none of the Ireland squad was in the Pegasus Hotel in Jamaica. The players were celebrating St Patrick's Day and the victory over Pakistan in Ocho Rios, which is \"some 50 miles away\". April 17 Speculation that Woolmer was poisoned is resurrected by local newspapers in the Caribbean claiming to quote the toxicology report which states that samples taken from his blood, stomach and urine have shown the presence of a foreign substance. An unnamed government source says that this substance could have been poison. April 16 It is reported that police officers from Jamaica will visit Pakistan to quiz players over \"inconsistencies\" in statements. April 15 A report in the UK Sunday Times quotes police sources as saying that Woolmer was poisoned before being strangled. Mark Shields announces he will fly to South Africa to meet with Woolmer's family. April 12 Jamaican police announce that CCTV footage from the Pegasus Hotel has been sent to Scotland Yard in London for further analysis. April 12 Jamaican police announce that CCTV footage from the Pegasus Hotel has been sent to Scotland Yard in London for further analysis. April 11 It is reported in Kingston that the coroner's inquest into Woolmer's death will start on April 23. Sources say that Patrick Murphy, the coroner for Kingston, will hold a full hearing, complete with live testimony from as many as a dozen witnesses who were in the process of being summoned to appear. April 9 Inzamam-ul-Haq said the World Cup would have been stopped if Woolmer's death had happened in any other country. The replacements for Woolmer and Inzamam as coach and captain will be discussed on Tuesday when the Pakistan Cricket Board's ad-hoc committee meets in Lahore. Inzamam told a parliamentary committee the World Cup defeats were part of cricket and he was \"hurt\" by match-fixing allegations. April 8 It wasn't a day for good news, with Mark Shields, the chief investigator, saying it may take another eight weeks to get the results of Woolmer's toxicology tests. The reports are crucial to proving whether Woolmer was poisoned or drugged and the delay means a quick end to the investigation is unlikely. \"It's in everyone's interest to know exactly when he died and how,\" Shields said. \"But frustrating as it may be, science goes at a certain pace.\" Apparently Woolmer's last meal was lasagne. April 7 Gill Woolmer has given permission for the publication of his book which will be published in September. April 6 Gill Woolmer says her husband did not mention match-fixing or being scared in his final emails. Mrs Woolmer, who did not want him to take the coaching position with Pakistan, thought the police were doing a \"good job\" but she wanted a \"speedy conclusion\" to the investigation. Woolmer was keeping a World Cup diary and planning to write a book about his time with Pakistan, but Mrs Woolmer said \"it is best if that book never appears now\". \"If it is going to cause upset, it is not worth publishing.\" April 5 No major developments in the case have emerged a day after the memorial service for Woolmer in Cape Town. Ian Chappell writes that Woolmer's murder ended any chance of his brother Greg continuing his role as India's coach. \"Such an ugly incident is sure to focus your concentration on life's priorities. Greg is probably better off without all the angst that comes with one of the most demanding jobs in cricket.\" April 4 Allan Donald says Woolmer \"lived for the game and succumbed to the game\" during a memorial service for his former coach in Cape Town. Donald also read a statement from Woolmer's widow Gill and her two sons while Tim Noakes, who co-authored a book with Woolmer, described him as a \"cricket missionary\". The Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Nasim Ashraf attended the service at the Wynberg high school and said: \"We in Pakistan loved Bob.\" Woolmer's body is still in Jamaica and there are reports it has been embalmed, which could make a second post-mortem difficult. April 3 Four Scotland Yard detectives were due in Jamaica on Tuesday and they should be joined by a high-profile Pakistani policeman in a growing list of assistants. Mir Zubair Mahmood, who successfully led the investigation into the murder of the US reporter Daniel Pearl, is due to travel to Jamaica with another Pakistan security official on Wednesday. \"It's a big, big responsibility on our shoulders and I hope we will be able to live up to the expectations,\" Zubair said. Interpol's Dr Susan Hitchen, a forensic expert in DNA analysis, has also arrived in Kingston to help the local police. April 2 Mark Shields, the chief investigator, says there is a possibility a poison was used to incapacitate Woolmer before his death. \"I have said from the beginning that if he was manually strangled, there are certain aspects that don't quite add up,\" Shields told AFP. Shields did not comment directly on a report that aconite had been used to kill Woolmer and said it was pointless speculating before the toxicology reports returned. In The Age there are concerns Jamaican bureaucracy will hold up the inquiry into Woolmer's death. Meanwhile Nasim Ashraf, the chairman of the Pakistan board, has confirmed that the Pakistani policeman who led the probe into the murder of US reporter Daniel Pearl will travel to Jamaica to help police investigating the death of cricket coach Woolmer Inzamam-ul-Haq lays a wreath during a memorial service for Woolmer in Lahore © AFP April 1 A memorial service is held for Woolmer in Lahore and Inzamam-ul-Haq was there with six of his team-mates. Four hundred mourners attended and they hear Woolmer was like a \"second father\" to the squad. \"After Woolmer's family, the Pakistan team was the most aggrieved by his death,\" Inzamam says during the hour-long service. The Jamaica Gleaner says a blood-stained pillow was found in Woolmer's room, but Mark Shields, the chief investigator, does not confirm the report. Media speculation intensifies with reports in some papers claiming he was poisoned with the herb aconite. March 31 More official cavalry is arriving in Jamaica with a team from Scotland Yard due to land in the next week after a request for help from the local police. Three detectives and a scenes of crime officer will make the trip to review the investigation into Woolmer's death. There will be even more foreign assistance in trying to track down the killers after Nasim Ashraf, the PCB chairman, says two Pakistan police officers will also travel to Kingston. Ashraf, who says no players were involved in the crime, will attend Woolmer's memorial service in South Africa on Wednesday. He also says the next coach will be a Pakistani and announces the players' contracts would be suspended. March 30 Pakistan has offered to send a three-person team to Jamaica to help with the investigation, following reports of dissatisfaction within Pakistan over how the case is proceeding. If approved by the Jamaican authorities, the group would likely include one PCB official, one diplomat and one senior investigative officer. A report in the Daily Telegraph also indicates the Jamaica police have requested a group of Scotland Yard detectives fly to Kingston to review the inquiry. Plans for a memorial service in Cape Town next Wednesday were also announced, with speakers to include Allan Donald. March 29 The time of Woolmer's death is still in doubt, but Mark Shields, the chief investigator, is certain he was murdered. He confirms again that Woolmer died due to manual strangulation, possibly with a towel. CCTV has revealed all the people who were on the 12th floor of the Pegasus Hotel, but police have to wait for an exact time of death before Shields can \"tie down when we should be looking at the tape\". Dr Ere Seshaiah, the pathologist who carried out the autopsy, is confident of his findings, despite questions arising about the manner of the death. In Pakistan a report from Reuters says the team was ordered to play the final group game against Zimbabwe or they would have been handed severe fines. March 28 Jamaica police dismiss speculation that there will be a second autopsy on Woolmer's body in a bid to quash media speculation that he might have died after hitting his head on the bathroom sink rather than have been murdered; that follows comments from an unnamed Pakistan board official who said: \"We believe that the autopsy by the pathologist may have had error counts and [the police] are now considering having a second autopsy to confirm the cause of death\". March 27 Jamaican police are reported to be searching for three mystery fans who they want to question; they also say that an examination of Woolmer's laptop shows no evidence of anything to do with match-fixing; Mark Shields, the deputy police commissioner, explains that the meal Woolmer had in his room is also being examined. \"We are looking at whether his food was drugged, the meal was thrown away after he put the tray outside his room, but we are conducting toxicology and tissue tests.\" Pakistan are officially eliminated from the police investigation into the murder. March 26 Pakistan start their long journey home, but not before police had again questioned three members of the group. A Pakistan official complains that the team have been kept in the dark over the investigation.

He went on to make 149, the highest score in a World Cup final © Getty Images In 30 previous World Cup innings, Adam Gilchrist had never reached the three-figure mark - his highest had been 99, against the Sri Lankans in 2003. It seemed the run-out on that occasion would deny him the landmark forever, but in what will almost certainly be his final World Cup innings, Gilchrist conjured up his best display. By the time he was done, he had made the fifth century - and the highest score - in a World Cup final, and had put Australia firmly on the road to a hat-trick of World Cup triumphs.There was plenty of discussion over Ricky Ponting's decision to bat first after winning the toss in conditions which were likely to favour the fast bowlers, but Gilchrist made all that talk redundant with an astonishing display of attacking batsmanship. On a true pitch, Gilchrist needed precisely six balls to gauge the pace and bounce, before hitting Vaas for two fours and a six in a six-ball period which set the trend. In his first 24 deliveries he scored at a run a ball, before really turning it on. Once he got into his stride, none of the Sri Lankan bowlers had much clue about how to stop him.

Usually very strong square of the wicket on the off side, he scored 65 of his 149 runs in the V between mid-off and mid-on. In contrast, he scored just 13 in the arc from cover to third man.On a pitch on which the ball was coming on to the bat, Gilchrist's front-foot drives were particularly lethal and fetched him 63 runs, including six fours and five sixes. And when Muttiah Muralitharan came into the attack, Gilchrist employed the sweep to counter the fact that he couldn't read the spin out of the hand.

Lasith Malinga hadn't played against the Australians in the Super Eights, and that move probably saved the Sri Lankans about 20 runs, as the Australian openers gave themselves some time to figure him out. His first four overs went for six; his next four leaked 43. The Sri Lankans allowed only 46 in the first ten overs, and 118 in the last 16, but they lost the game in the 12 overs in between, as Gilchrist and Matthew Hayden blasted 117 at nearly ten per over. That was also the period when Gilchrist took the majority of the strike, and in the mood he was in, it was simply impossible to stop him.

The last time they were beaten was on May 23, 1999, when they lost to Pakistan by ten runs. (Click here for their list of World Cup results.) This was Gilchrist's third successive fifty-plus score in a World Cup final. He had scored 54 against Pakistan at Lord's in 1999 and 57 against India at Johannesburg in 2003. This was the 100th time that Gilchrist and Hayden were opening in ODIs, and they made it a special occasion by putting together 172, their best in ODIs, improving upon the 170 they added against South Africa at Durban in 2002. This was their 16th century stand for the first wicket, which equals the record held by Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly. Tendulkar and Ganguly, though, opened in 117 innings. The stand was the highest for the first wicket in a World Cup final, obliterating the 129 that Mike Brearley and Geoff Boycott added in 1979. Gilchrist and Hayden had also posted 105 for the opening wicket in the 2003 final against India, which is the only other century stand in a World Cup decider. It is also the second-highest partnership for all wickets in a World Cup final, after the 234-run stand between Ricky Ponting and Damien Martyn in the 2003 edition. Gilchrist is the fifth batsman to score a hundred in a World Cup final, after Clive Lloyd (102 in 1975), Viv Richards (138 in 1979), Aravinda de Silva (107 in 1996) and Ponting (140 in 2003). He is the fourth wicketkeeper - after Dave Houghton, Andy Flower and Rahul Dravid - to score a century in World Cups. Gilchrist completed 9000 ODI runs and 1000 World Cup runs during the course of his 149. Gilchrist slammed eight sixes in his knock, which equals the World Cup record for most sixes in a single innings, which is jointly held by Ponting and Imran Nazir. Gilchrist also had a good game with the gloves, and when he snaffled Upul Tharanga, he became the first wicketkeeper to get to 50 dismissals behind the stumps. This was the second-highest opening partnership against Sri Lanka in World Cups. The highest was by an Australian pair too - Rick McCosker and Alan Turner added 182 at The Oval in 1975. These are also Australia's two best first-wicket stands in World Cups. Sri Lanka didn't have much to celebrate, but there was one important personal milestone for Sanath Jayasuriya - when he reached 58, he became only the second batsman, after Sachin Tendulkar, to get to 12,000 ODI runs. Jayasuriya now has 12,005 runs from 390 ODIs, at an average of 33.25. With Kumar Sangakkara scoring 54 as well, this was a pretty good match for wicketkeepers. It was the first time in the World Cup that two keepers scored a hundred and a half-century in the same game. Glenn McGrath finished with just one wicket, but that was enough to lift his tally in the tournament to 26, the highest by any bowler in a single World Cup. Chaminda Vaas had a forgettable game, conceding 54 from eight overs, during the course of which he became the sixth bowler to concede more than 1000 runs in World Cups. He joins Wasim Akram, Javagal Srinath, Muralitharan, Jayasuriya and McGrath. Ponting's run-out was the 13th instance of a captain being dismissed in such a manner in this tournament. It's a record for a single World Cup, beating the previous record of seven in 1992.Matthew HaydenAdam GilchristGlenn McGrathAustraliaSri LankaAustralia vs Sri LankaICC World Cup Matches (11) Matches (11) (11) SL v PAK (1) SL v PAK (1) (1) SA-W in ENG (1) SA-W in ENG (1) (1) County DIV1 (5) County DIV1 (5) (5) County DIV2 (3) County DIV2 (3) (3) TNPL (1) TNPL (1) (1) Live • 2nd TEST • Galle • 2nd TEST (15.1 ov) & Day 3 - Session 2: Sri Lanka lead by 206 runs.

He went on to make 149, the highest score in a World Cup final © Getty Images In 30 previous World Cup innings, Adam Gilchrist had never reached the three-figure mark - his highest had been 99, against the Sri Lankans in 2003. It seemed the run-out on that occasion would deny him the landmark forever, but in what will almost certainly be his final World Cup innings, Gilchrist conjured up his best display. By the time he was done, he had made the fifth century - and the highest score - in a World Cup final, and had put Australia firmly on the road to a hat-trick of World Cup triumphs. There was plenty of discussion over Ricky Ponting's decision to bat first after winning the toss in conditions which were likely to favour the fast bowlers, but Gilchrist made all that talk redundant with an astonishing display of attacking batsmanship. On a true pitch, Gilchrist needed precisely six balls to gauge the pace and bounce, before hitting Vaas for two fours and a six in a six-ball period which set the trend. In his first 24 deliveries he scored at a run a ball, before really turning it on. Once he got into his stride, none of the Sri Lankan bowlers had much clue about how to stop him. Break-up of Gilchrist's 104-ball 149 Runs Dot balls 4s/ 6s First 24 balls 24 13 2/ 1 Next 80 balls 125 30 11/ 6 Gilchrist versus the Sri Lankan bowlers Bowler Balls Runs 4s/ 6s Scoring rate Muttiah Muralitharan 23 23 0/ 1 100.00 Lasith Malinga 17 19 3/ 0 111.76 Chaminda Vaas 25 30 4/ 1 120.00 Dilhara Fernando 23 42 5/ 2 182.60 Tillakaratne Dilshan 7 15 0/ 2 214.28 Sanath Jayasuriya 9 20 1/ 2 222.22 It was a typical Gilchrist innings in terms of his scoring rate, but not in terms of the strokes he played or the areas in which he scored. Usually very strong square of the wicket on the off side, he scored 65 of his 149 runs in the V between mid-off and mid-on. In contrast, he scored just 13 in the arc from cover to third man. On a pitch on which the ball was coming on to the bat, Gilchrist's front-foot drives were particularly lethal and fetched him 63 runs, including six fours and five sixes. And when Muttiah Muralitharan came into the attack, Gilchrist employed the sweep to counter the fact that he couldn't read the spin out of the hand. Gilchrist's glittering strokeplay Stroke Balls Runs 4s/ 6s Front-foot drives 40 63 6/ 5 Flick/ pull 34 57 6/ 2 Sweep 9 14 0/ 1 Cut/ back-foot strokes 21 15 1/ 0 The Sri Lankans were completely outclassed in the field, but the start didn't suggest such a rout was on the cards. Lasith Malinga hadn't played against the Australians in the Super Eights, and that move probably saved the Sri Lankans about 20 runs, as the Australian openers gave themselves some time to figure him out. His first four overs went for six; his next four leaked 43. The Sri Lankans allowed only 46 in the first ten overs, and 118 in the last 16, but they lost the game in the 12 overs in between, as Gilchrist and Matthew Hayden blasted 117 at nearly ten per over. That was also the period when Gilchrist took the majority of the strike, and in the mood he was in, it was simply impossible to stop him. Break-up of Gilchrist and Hayden's 172-run partnership Period Gilchrist - Balls Runs Hayden - Balls Runs First 10 overs (46 runs) 30 31 31 14 Next 12.5 overs (126 runs) 53 88 25 24 More stats With this win, Australia extended their unbeaten run in World Cup matches to 29, and their winning streak to 23. The last time they were beaten was on May 23, 1999, when they lost to Pakistan by ten runs. (Click here for their list of World Cup results.) This was Gilchrist's third successive fifty-plus score in a World Cup final. He had scored 54 against Pakistan at Lord's in 1999 and 57 against India at Johannesburg in 2003. This was the 100th time that Gilchrist and Hayden were opening in ODIs, and they made it a special occasion by putting together 172, their best in ODIs, improving upon the 170 they added against South Africa at Durban in 2002. This was their 16th century stand for the first wicket, which equals the record held by Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly. Tendulkar and Ganguly, though, opened in 117 innings. The stand was the highest for the first wicket in a World Cup final, obliterating the 129 that Mike Brearley and Geoff Boycott added in 1979. Gilchrist and Hayden had also posted 105 for the opening wicket in the 2003 final against India, which is the only other century stand in a World Cup decider. It is also the second-highest partnership for all wickets in a World Cup final, after the 234-run stand between Ricky Ponting and Damien Martyn in the 2003 edition. Gilchrist is the fifth batsman to score a hundred in a World Cup final, after Clive Lloyd (102 in 1975), Viv Richards (138 in 1979), Aravinda de Silva (107 in 1996) and Ponting (140 in 2003). He is the fourth wicketkeeper - after Dave Houghton, Andy Flower and Rahul Dravid - to score a century in World Cups. Gilchrist completed 9000 ODI runs and 1000 World Cup runs during the course of his 149. Gilchrist slammed eight sixes in his knock, which equals the World Cup record for most sixes in a single innings, which is jointly held by Ponting and Imran Nazir. Gilchrist also had a good game with the gloves, and when he snaffled Upul Tharanga, he became the first wicketkeeper to get to 50 dismissals behind the stumps. This was the second-highest opening partnership against Sri Lanka in World Cups. The highest was by an Australian pair too - Rick McCosker and Alan Turner added 182 at The Oval in 1975. These are also Australia's two best first-wicket stands in World Cups. Sri Lanka didn't have much to celebrate, but there was one important personal milestone for Sanath Jayasuriya - when he reached 58, he became only the second batsman, after Sachin Tendulkar, to get to 12,000 ODI runs. Jayasuriya now has 12,005 runs from 390 ODIs, at an average of 33.25. With Kumar Sangakkara scoring 54 as well, this was a pretty good match for wicketkeepers. It was the first time in the World Cup that two keepers scored a hundred and a half-century in the same game. Glenn McGrath finished with just one wicket, but that was enough to lift his tally in the tournament to 26, the highest by any bowler in a single World Cup. Chaminda Vaas had a forgettable game, conceding 54 from eight overs, during the course of which he became the sixth bowler to concede more than 1000 runs in World Cups.

In 2007, teams were split into four groups of four each but the experiment backfired when India and Pakistan bowed out in the first round, considerably robbing the tournament of commercial and spectator interest. The latest format, though, gave the teams more chances of recovering from a poor start. Teams were split into two groups of seven each, every team playing the other in the group once. The top four from each group would qualify for the quarter-finals.Initially, the four subcontinent teams were due to host the tournament, but the terror attack on the Sri Lanka team bus in Lahore in 2009, and the deteriorating security situation, led to Pakistan being dropped as a co-host. The matches were then shared between India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.Innovations It was the first World Cup to use the DRS, and Super Over for deciding tied matches (though not for the group matches).Group stages The tournament began with a series of one-sided games, with the minnows Kenya and Canada getting thrashed. Netherlands gave England a scare by posting 292 but failed to defend it. Pakistan, too, overcame a scare against Canada in a low-scoring game. Bangalore hosted two thrillers: the match between India and England ended in a tie and England lost to Ireland in another close match. Ireland looked all but out of the contest at 111 for 5, chasing a massive 328, but Kevin O'Brien played the innings of his life - 113 - to give his side one of their best wins.

Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Australia and New Zealand qualified from Group A while South Africa, India, England and West Indies made it from the other group. India knocked out defending champions Australia - in search of their fourth consecutive title while Pakistan thrashed West Indies by ten wickets after bundling them out for 112. South Africa were comfortably placed to beat New Zealand but choked - not for the first time in an ICC tournament - and their batting collapsed to Jacob Oram in a vitriolic quarter-final; Sri Lanka hammered England by ten wickets in front of home fans in Colombo.The semis In the first semi-final in Colombo, Sri Lanka restricted New Zealand to 217 and overcame jitters towards the end to win by five wickets. In the second semi-final, the organisers got what they had hoped for - an India-Pakistan clash in a knockout. Sachin Tendulkar was dropped as many as five times on his way to 85 and India posted a competitive 260 in Mohali, with Wahab Riaz taking a five-wicket haul. The chase was tantalising but Pakistan failed to soak up the pressure as the game wore on and lost regular wickets. Misbah-ul-Haq, caught in two minds whether to attack or play safe, was left with too much to do in the end, as Pakistan succumbed to their fifth consecutive defeat against India in World Cup matches.The final India were in their third World Cup final and their first at home. Sri Lanka made it to their second consecutive final but the partisan crowd was always going to test them. Mahela Jayawardene overcame that pressure to score a poetic century, guiding Sri Lanka to 274 and leaving India to pull off the highest chase in a World Cup final. There was a hush when India lost Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag early, but Gautam Gambhir and Virat Kohli revived hopes with a stand of 83. Then came the captain's masterstroke. MS Dhoni chose to promote himself ahead of the in-form Yuvraj Singh, with India needing 160 from 28 overs. Gambhir fell for 97 but India still had the upper hand with Dhoni steadying the nerves at the other end. Yuvraj Singh joined Dhoni and the pair snatched all hope for the visitors with a flurry of boundaries. Dhoni's winning six over long-on, followed by a stylish bat twirl that rested under his arm pit, became the tournament's snapshot as India won the World Cup after 28 years. Yuvraj, who fought off illness through the World Cup, picked up the Man of the Tournament award.Last hurrah Muttiah Muralitharan, who had quit Tests a year earlier, bowed out of international cricket after the final. Pakistan's Shoaib Akhtar announced midway through the tournament that he was quitting international cricket.Not to be forgotten Compared to the 2007 World Cup, the tournament was a resounding success, thanks largely to the fact that India, the powerhouse of world cricket, triumphed at home. The ICC got the format right, though it was probably their good fortune that India and Pakistan didn't get eliminated in the quarter-finals. There was a controversy, though, barely days after the final. In a bid to make the tournament even more competitive, the ICC had decided to limit the 2015 and 2019 editions to just the ten Test nations. However, following a wave of protests from the Associates, the ICC later decided to revert to the 14-team format for the 2015 edition, giving the Associates a chance to play in the tournament via a qualifier. Ireland's inspiring win against England fuelled the debate that it was unfair to cull the Associates and that a ten-team World Cup would not give the tournament a 'global' feel. The 2011 edition would also be remembered for Dhoni's swagger in the wining moment.ICC Cricket World CupKanishkaa Balachandran is a senior sub-editor at ESPNcricinfo Matches (11) Matches (11) (11) SL v PAK (1) SL v PAK (1) (1) SA-W in ENG (1) SA-W in ENG (1) (1) County DIV1 (5) County DIV1 (5) (5) County DIV2 (3) County DIV2 (3) (3) TNPL (1) TNPL (1) (1) Live • 2nd TEST • Galle • 2nd TEST (15.1 ov) & Day 3 - Session 2: Sri Lanka lead by 206 runs.

Yuvraj Singh joined Dhoni and the pair snatched all hope for the visitors with a flurry of boundaries. Dhoni's winning six over long-on, followed by a stylish bat twirl that rested under his arm pit, became the tournament's snapshot as India won the World Cup after 28 years. Yuvraj, who fought off illness through the World Cup, picked up the Man of the Tournament award. Last hurrah Muttiah Muralitharan, who had quit Tests a year earlier, bowed out of international cricket after the final. Pakistan's Shoaib Akhtar announced midway through the tournament that he was quitting international cricket. Not to be forgotten Compared to the 2007 World Cup, the tournament was a resounding success, thanks largely to the fact that India, the powerhouse of world cricket, triumphed at home. The ICC got the format right, though it was probably their good fortune that India and Pakistan didn't get eliminated in the quarter-finals. There was a controversy, though, barely days after the final. In a bid to make the tournament even more competitive, the ICC had decided to limit the 2015 and 2019 editions to just the ten Test nations. However, following a wave of protests from the Associates, the ICC later decided to revert to the 14-team format for the 2015 edition, giving the Associates a chance to play in the tournament via a qualifier. Ireland's inspiring win against England fuelled the debate that it was unfair to cull the Associates and that a ten-team World Cup would not give the tournament a 'global' feel. The 2011 edition would also be remembered for Dhoni's swagger in the wining moment.

It was the veteran Ponting's first reverse in 28 World Cup matches as captain, and means his team will likely face fellow heavyweights India or England in the quarterfinals after finishing third in the seven-nation pool. Pakistan's reward for the four-wicket victory in Colombo is a likely clash with the West Indies or England. The last-eight scenario will be known on Sunday after India take on the Windies -- England have already played all their round-robin fixtures. Murali helps Sri Lanka secure second place Pakistan went into the match against Australia in fourth place, a point behind New Zealand -- who will now play Group B winners South Africa following the Proteas' 206-run thrashing of co-hosts Bangladesh earlier on Saturday. Australia, seeking a fifth title in the 10th staging of the 50-over tournament, posted a poor total of 176 all out -- the team's lowest at a World Cup since 1992 -- as Pakistan's opening bowler Umar Gul took 3-30 and all-rounder Abdul Razzaq chipped in with 2-8. Opener Brad Haddin top-scored with 42 while vice-captain Michael Clarke made 34 as the Australians were bowled out in 46.4 overs. Veteran fast bowler Brett Lee made Pakistan battle as he claimed four wickets but Asad Shafiq continued his promising start to his international career with 46 and 20-year-old Umar Akmal was unbeaten at the end on 44. With Pakistan teetering a little on 142-6, Razzaq weighed in with 20 off 24 balls to guide his team home with nine overs to spare. South Africa secured a fifth win in six outings by ending Bangladesh's hopes of progressing with a one-sided victory in Dhaka. Jacques Kallis (69), Faf du Plessis (52) and opener Hashim Amla (51) all made half-centuries as the Proteas compiled a daunting 284-8, with captain Graeme Smith contributing 45 to a first-wicket stand of 97. Bangladesh then collapsed to 78 all out, mirroring the earlier capitulation against the West Indies which yielded 20 fewer runs. Left-arm fast bowler Lonwabo Tsotsobe claimed three early wickets, and spin bowler Robin Peterson continued the steady flow of departing batsmen with impressive figures of 4-12 from his seven overs. Mixx Mixx", "", " Last updated on 29 March 201529 March 2015.From the section Cricket Australia overwhelmed New Zealand to win the World Cup for a fifth time at an ecstatic Melbourne Cricket Ground. New Zealand lost influential captain Brendon McCullum to the fifth ball of the match and were bowled out for 183. Grant Elliott resisted with 83, while Mitchell Starc, Mitchell Johnson and James Faulkner shared eight wickets. Australia rarely looked troubled, sealing a seven-wicket win in 33.1 overs, with captain Michael Clarke scoring 74 and Steve Smith 56 not out. Clarke, in his final one-day international, was given a standing ovation by the record 93,000 crowd and welcomed by his team-mates on the boundary when he was bowled by Matt Henry with eight required. He was part of the Australia team that last lifted the trophy in 2007, with this success extending their record for most World Cups won. No other team has more than two. Australia's win was the second in as many tournaments by a host nation after India's triumph four years ago. It provided a joyous end to an emotional Australian summer which saw batsman Phillip Hughes die after being struck on the neck by a ball in Sydney in November. In their first final, after six previous semi-final defeats, New Zealand were blown away. Their path to Melbourne came with eight successive wins, all on home soil, and most of the pre-match speculation was of how McCullum's men would deal with the change in conditions. They won what was thought to be a crucial toss, but the life was sucked from their innings almost as soon as it began. The talismanic McCullum, so often a slayer of new-ball attacks throughout the tournament, aimed two wild swings at Starc, missed with both, then was bowled by a brilliant yorker. Far from the batting paradise predicted, the pitch was slightly two-paced and offered both turn and some uneven bounce. But that is to take nothing away from the Australia pace attack, Starc in particular, who bowled with hostility and found movement both in the air and off the seam. New Zealand clung on without progressing, but when Glenn Maxwell's off-spin got through a lazy Martin Guptill stroke and Kane Williamson patted back to Johnson, they seemed in disarray. However, from 39-3, they painstakingly rebuilt through semi-final hero Elliott and Ross Taylor. Elliott, who successfully overturned a Maxwell lbw decision on 15, scored almost exclusively through the off-side to become only the fifth man to register a half-century in the semi-final and final of the same World Cup. Taylor made 40 in a stand of 111 provided a platform for the batting powerplay. Yet it was the powerplay that began New Zealand's slide, as Faulkner returned to have Taylor athletically caught behind by Brad Haddin and bowl Corey Anderson two balls later. When Luke Ronchi played an awful waft to be caught at slip off Starc, three wickets had been lost for one run in eight balls. There was no support for Elliott, who was caught behind attempting to heave Faulkner and, when Maxwell superbly ran out non-striker Tim Southee with a direct hit for the final wicket, it was the perfect demonstration of Australia's dominance. In all, New Zealand lost seven wickets for 33 runs. Though Aaron Finch inside-edged on to his pad to be caught and bowled by Trent Boult, David Warner's brisk 45 gave Australia's chase early momentum. After he was caught hooking Henry, there began a period of pressure that Clarke and Smith battled to absorb, the latter needing the fortune of seeing the bails stay unmoved as a Henry delivery trickled on to the base of the stumps. It would be New Zealand's last chance, as Clarke's cuts and drives down the ground accelerated Australia towards victory. He could not see the job through, but Smith became the first man to score five successive World Cup half-centuries then pulled Henry for the winning runs.

NEW ZEALAND WILL RESUME THEIR INNINGS ON WEDNESDAY. ICC STATEMENT: Due to adverse weather, the match officials have declared that no further play is possible in today's semi-final between India and New Zealand at Old Trafford. The match will recommence tomorrow (Wednesday 10 July) at 10.30am BST (3 pm IST), weather permitting. The game will continue where it was halted - New Zealand will complete their 50-over innings and India will then complete their 50-over innings, weather permitting. The match may be shortened dependent on conditions. For the match to be completed, India are required to bat for at least 20 overs. If after the reserve day the match has still not reached a result, India will progress to the final given their higher finishing position in the group stage. 22:44 IST 22:38 IST 22:35 IST -- Umpires and officials are having a chat with captains. 22:21 IST -- BAD NEWS!

In that case, the match would continue Wednesday from where it left off rather than be re-started. But if a 20 overs per side match cannot be completed on Wednesday as well, India would go through to Sunday's final at Lord's on the basis of having finished first to New Zealand's fourth in the 10-team group stage. 19:35 IST -- UPDATE: 19:00 IST RAIN UPDATE: It has gotten heavier in Manchester.

It's going to remain similar throughout the course of the game - we have done well in Manchester. We have had two good games in Manchester, and it's about focussing on the basics.

We have played a number of games here. A toss-up with the overheads, but it'll be around all day, so we need to get the job first up. We are used to the routine, but we have a great opportunity to put up a good performance against a side like India. Ferguson comes in for Southee. PLAYING XIs: New Zealand: India: TEAM NEWS: TOSS: New Zealand captain Kane Williamson wins toss, opts to bat against India at Old Trafford Pitch Report, courtesy VVS Laxman: Even though it's overcast, the wicket looks dry. It's a fresh wicket, and it's definitely a bat-first wicket. It's a semi-final, there will be a lot of scoreboard pressure. Perhaps India might try Jadeja for batting depth. Jadhav has got Williamson and Taylor out before, so he might pip Karthik into the Playing XI.

Two teams without a World Cup title between them in 44 years of the men's competition. After 100 overs, the last couple of which contained almost as much drama as a few previous finals in their entirety, nothing could separate England and New Zealand. For the first time in World Cup history, a Super Over was required to determine the winner.Asked to score 16 from six balls, Jimmy Neesham coolly struck Jofra Archer's second legitimate delivery way back into the Mound Stand, making the equation seven off four. A brace of twos followed, before Archer's bumper took Neesham off strike. Martin Guptill, at the end of a tournament of personal trial, needing to hit two more otherwise England would take the trophy on boundaries scored. Archer found a yorker, Guptill found deep midwicket and Jason Roy's throw found Guptill short; Jos Buttler completed the run-out at full stretch to end all those years of hurt and an afternoon of exquisite agony.What the playing conditions say- In the event of a Super Over tie, the team that hit more boundaries (combined from the main match and the Super Over) shall be the winner- If the number of boundaries hit by both teams is equal, the team whose batsmen scored more boundaries during its innings in the main match (ignoring the Super Over) shall be the winner- If still equal, a count-back from the final ball of the Super Over will be conducted. The team with the higher scoring delivery shall be the winner. If a team loses two wickets during its over, then any unbowled deliveries will be counted as dot ballsEngland had only got close in their chase thanks to Buttler and Ben Stokes, whose 110-run stand lifted the home nation from peril at 86 for 4. The pair walked out again to scramble 15 from an over of Trent Boult: pressure back on New Zealand. They responded by sending out Neesham, a man who not so long ago was contemplating quitting the game, to face Archer, in his 14th ODI. Only one could finish a hero.That said, there were heroes aplenty on both sides. For the second game in succession, New Zealand put up a score in the region of 240 and defended it with every fibre of their Blackcapped beings. Just when they appeared to have the game won, a man born in Christchurch ripped it from their hands, in a manner at once extraordinary and unbelievable. Stokes finished unbeaten on 84, though like Guptil he too could not manage a two from the final ball of England's innings to win the game in regulation time.New Zealand had gone into the final over believing that the trophy was in their grasp. England needed 15, Stokes carrying a country's hopes - not to mention the almost unbearable weight of history - on his shoulders. The first two balls bowled by Boult were dots, before Stokes mowed the third for six into the crowd at midwicket. Then came an intervention that was either cruel or miraculous, depending on your perspective. Stokes, diving for his ground as he attempted to complete a second run, diverted Guptill's throw off his bat - inadvertantly - past wicketkeeper Tom Latham and away to the rope for four more.Jos Buttler runs out Martin Guptill to crown England champions•Getty ImagesStokes immediately held up his hands in apology, but with no sign that he had changed the course of his run to intercept the throw, it went down as a second consecutive six. That left England needing three from two, though Boult kept his cool to twice run out the non-striker coming back for a second and send the game into a Super Over.The previous over, something almost as extraordinary had occurred: having caught Stokes on the boundary at wide long-on, Boult stepped on the rope before he could relay the ball back in to Guptill. Instead of Stokes departing for 63, with England needing 22 off eight and Nos. 9 and 10 at the crease, he was granted another shot at redemption. Instead of Kolkata Part II, this was to become his finest hour, Stokes ultimately crowned man of the match after leading England to victory in a World Cup final at the fourth time of asking.Watch on Hotstar (India only): Highlights of the heart-stopping World Cup finalThere is a new name on the cup, then, but they didn't half keep the engravers waiting. England had built towards this competition for four years, planned for it, yearned for it - and when the moment came, the outburst was rapturous. Staid and stuffy Lord's had become a cauldron of emotion long before that last passage of play.New Zealand deserved better than to end up the fall guys again. Their captain, Kane Williamson, orchestrated his men in the field to squeeze England's chase until it became unbearable. First Buttler fell with 46 required from the last 31 balls, Lockie Ferguson delivering what seemed to be the killer blow. Stokes staggered on, even as the tail became expendable. Ultimately, the fact England had scored 24 boundaries in their innings, compared to New Zealand's 16, was the decisive factor.Watch on Hotstar (USA only): Highlights of the epic World Cup 2019 finalThat one of England's fours was effectively an overthrow may always rankle, as well as a couple of the umpiring decisions that went the other way. Williamson, who made only 30 but captained with nerves of steel and was named man of the tournament, called the runs via Stokes' deflection \"a shame\" but suggested that for New Zealand, beaten finalists for the second World Cup running, it was just not meant to be.The very first delivery of England's chase gave an indication of how nerve-shredding a contest this would become. Boult produced a curving inswinger to hit Jason Roy squarely on the front pad and 4.8m primarily rugby-loving people went up in unison. Marais Erasmus shook his head and although New Zealand chose to review, it was Roy who benefited from the marginal nature of umpire's call.Eoin Morgan holds the World Cup aloft•Getty ImagesThe opening exchanges were a blur of black and blue, with bruises on both sides, when Matt Henry finally located Roy's outside edge. England's opening partnership has been totemic and Roy had swaggered into this final, so the importance of his dismissal was twofold in that it both dented English confidence and deprived the chase of a man who might quickly reduce the odds in their favour.With Henry bowling a beautiful spell and Joe Root unable to find his rhythm, New Zealand clawed their way into the ascendency. The tension was enervating, Lord's subdued. Colin de Grandhomme dropped Bairstow off his own bowling, a reaction chance to his midriff, as New Zealand strung together three maidens in a row. Root then cracked: hit on the pads and then beaten when he gave de Grandhomme the charge, he next threw his bat at a wide outswinger to be caught behind.In stultifying conditions, New Zealand applied a choke hold. Bairstow dragged on against the pace of Ferguson, who then brilliantly caught Eoin Morgan running in from deep point. Meanwhile de Grandhomme, playing the role of a latter-day Madan Lal, bowled ten overs off the reel.Nothing about this contest was straightforward, including the decision at the toss, which had been delayed by 15 minutes due to early morning rain. Williamson chose to bat, in keeping with the dominant trend at this tournament - runs on the board matter. While England bowled well enough, a Powerplay score of 33 for 1 left the teams circling each other warily; New Zealand happy to have only lost Guptill, England eager to send back Williamson, too, as quickly as possible.With Henry Nicholls providing the first half-century by a New Zealand opener since the opening game, they were able to establish a foothold. As in the group match between these two, Nicholls was given out lbw on zero by a Chris Woakes delivery that was going over the stumps; this time, on the biggest stage, he had the wherewithal to use New Zealand's review.England thought they might have removed Guptill inside the first couple of overs, too, only for Erasmus to correctly adjudge that the ball from Archer had flicked the batsman's trousers rather than outside edge. Guptill's response was to try and hit a way out of his rut, ramping Archer for six and smashing another boundary back down the ground. But Woakes brought one back inside an expansive drive to hit the back leg, and Guptill's wasted review was to have consequences later on.Nicholls and Williamson played sensibly to put on 74 but, whether it was the pitch or the occasion, the innings nevertheless began to enter a gentle tailspin from the moment Williamson was removed by Liam Plunkett - DRS again required to overturn the on-field call. Nicholls chopped on against another Plunkett cross-seamer four overs later, and then New Zealand were left to curse their luck when Ross Taylor was given out lbw, despite ball-tracking showing the ball going over the top of leg stump. It would not end up being the only talking point of the day.Jofra ArcherBen StokesNew ZealandEnglandEngland vs New ZealandICC Cricket World CupAlan Gardner is a deputy editor at ESPNcricinfo. @alanroderick Matches (11) Matches (11) (11) SL v PAK (1) SL v PAK (1) (1) SA-W in ENG (1) SA-W in ENG (1) (1) County DIV1 (5) County DIV1 (5) (5) County DIV2 (3) County DIV2 (3) (3) TNPL (1) TNPL (1) (1) Live • 2nd TEST • Galle • 2nd TEST (15.1 ov) & Day 3 - Session 2: Sri Lanka lead by 206 runs.

When you love sport, you understand how it can take you to places little else can. You could watch it all your life and never quite fathom what happened between 6.30 and 7.30pm in two sun-kissed rectangles of grass seven or so miles apart across England's capital city. A World Cup final that might just be the greatest game of cricket in history, a Wimbledon men's final longer than any that has come before. Because this was summer's sporting day of days, they stepped hand in hand. You couldn't watch and you couldn't look away. You hated it and you loved it and you lost yourself completely to it. No-one had ever seen Lord's like this, a beautiful sedate museum turned into a cavorting mess. No-one had really seen cricket like this. There is a line often brought out when sport does these sorts of things - you couldn't write this - and a hoary riposte: haven't you seen Star Wars, or read Harry Potter? On a day when sometimes nothing appeared to make sense, both these contradictory positions became true. You couldn't write it, because it was a plotline too twisted to make dramatic sense, too confusing, too remote from what has gone before. We're OK with spaceships and child wizards because they have been imagined before. Plenty had dreamed of England winning the World Cup. That's where logic waved farewell. A match that ended in a tie to produce a tie-breaker that also ended in a tie. A final over that contained a six that was a six and also contained a six that wasn't a six at all but actually a two and a four, which meant the final over wasn't the final over any more either. When you try to navigate your way through those 60 hallucinogenic minutes you keep coming up against these impossible riddles: New Zealand's Martin Guptill facing the first ball of the match and the last one too; a tournament that England's men had never won before won with a winning margin that wasn't even a winning margin. Seven weeks of cricket and it came down to the final dusty half-metre at the spiritual home of the sport. A final that for so long was slow-motion cricket ending at a pace that took the breath from your lungs and the strength from your legs. Cricket that was a throwback to 20 years ago suddenly leaping into the unknown. It was unprecedented and it was also a very English way to win a World Cup. Extra time at Wembley in 1966, extra time in Sydney in 2003. A champagne super over in London, that strange comforting familiarity of feeling absolutely awful watching England do something you had always hoped they might. Eoin Morgan's men were supposed to be rompers in this tournament. They were the demolition men who took on big totals and danced across the finish line. You knew deep down it was never going to be easy. It never is with England. You just didn't know it was going to be this hard. There were scoring rates from the late 1990s and an innings perfectly pitched to that fragile, panicked era of England one-day batting, as if the cavalier swordsmen of the current team had been replaced by a cricketing historical re-enactment society. Romp? It was like a four-hour penalty shootout, at least until it became a shootout, at which point England's final over felt like a lifetime and then produced one more for each side that took another half-hour. Panic on the posh streets of London, panic in the living-rooms of the nation. As the contest swung one way then the other and then back again, Lord's was awash with pacers - men and women walking, hopping, striding purposely to nowhere at all. As Ben Stokes dragged England to the brink, into the abyss and then out again, a country had long forgotten that watching sport is supposed to be fun. All the while, horrible sums. 100 needed from 88. 80 from 66. 65 off 48, people standing up to cheer a wide. It was 44 from 26 as the final hour began. Men in crisp cotton shirts and chinos swigging pink champagne direct from the bottle. 39 off 24, 34 needed off the last three overs, 24 off two. The 50th over began at 6.55. 15 runs required. Two balls later, 15 needed from four, and then, in two balls and four minutes, came 12 impossible runs. At 7pm, England needed two to win. Mark Wood was run out by a mile, and so the final act began: a World Cup into its first ever super over at the same time as a Wimbledon final went into its first ever fifth-set tie-breaker. Both teams thought they had it won and lost in the tumult of the final 12 balls, just as both Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer could feel the Wimbledon trophy in their hands. At some distant forgotten point in the afternoon the hero was going to be Liam Plunkett until it was Colin de Grandhomme, at least until Jos Buttler took over, and then the super over began and it was suddenly Stokes until it was Buttler, except it was then Jimmy Neesham and then Jofra Archer and then Jason Roy and Buttler all over again. You realised as that final throw came in from Roy to his wicketkeeper to leave Guptill and New Zealand that tiny, vast distance short that you were lucky to have seen it and that cricket was lucky to have conjured it. Fourteen long years since the last live England game on free-to-air television, a day for the converted to testify, a chance for a whole new generation to feel the unique horrors and joys of watching England play cricket. You felt like putting an arm around the new devotees in the giddy aftermath. It's not always like this. But it can do exactly this to you. It was awful for New Zealand, fancied by no-one, so close to pulling off one of the great upsets with a brand of cricket that felt archaic until it made perfect sense. It was no sort of compensation for the brilliant Kane Williamson to be awarded man of the tournament. But it was wonderful for England, four years on from their humiliation in Adelaide at the last World Cup, and it was redemption for all those who have followed them and hoped and suffered along the way. So much happened in the golden hour that you struggle to hold on to discrete images. But there is one England supporters will never forget: 11 men in pale blue, chasing wild circles on the green Lord's outfield as the stumps lay splattered and Guptill knelt beside them, the ancient pavilion dancing, the shadows stretching, the World Cup - after 44 long years - finally won.

Cricket that was a throwback to 20 years ago suddenly leaping into the unknown.It was unprecedented and it was also a very English way to win a World Cup.Extra time at Wembley in 1966, extra time in Sydney in 2003.

When you love sport, you understand how it can take you to places little else can. You could watch it all your life and never quite fathom what happened between 6.30 and 7.30pm in two sun-kissed rectangles of grass seven or so miles apart across England's capital city. A World Cup final that might just be the greatest game of cricket in history, a Wimbledon men's final longer than any that has come before. Because this was summer's sporting day of days, they stepped hand in hand. You couldn't watch and you couldn't look away. You hated it and you loved it and you lost yourself completely to it. No-one had ever seen Lord's like this, a beautiful sedate museum turned into a cavorting mess. No-one had really seen cricket like this. There is a line often brought out when sport does these sorts of things - you couldn't write this - and a hoary riposte: haven't you seen Star Wars, or read Harry Potter? On a day when sometimes nothing appeared to make sense, both these contradictory positions became true. You couldn't write it, because it was a plotline too twisted to make dramatic sense, too confusing, too remote from what has gone before.

Sunil Gavaskar, who scored an unbeaten 174-ball 36, later claimed that he thought the target was unachievable and decided to take some match practice. First hit-wicket in ODIs In the 1975 World Cup final, West Indies opener Roy Fredricks lost balance and kicked the leg stump with his left leg after hooking a Dennis Lillee bouncer. Agonisingly, the ball went for a six over long-leg, but Fredricks became the first player to be out hit-wicket in ODI history. A jaw-dropping shot During the 1979 World Cup final, with no field restrictions, England captain Mike Brearley sent all his fielders deep to protect the boundary. However, Viv Richards, on 132, anticipated a full ball, moved to the off-side and played a stylish flick to send it all the way and took the cricketing world by surprise. Recalling the moment, Richards later said, \"That shot is my invention.\" A captain agrees to change a four to six and his team lose by 1 run When Dean Jones lofted Maninder Singh over mid-off during a 1987 World Cup match in Madras, the umpire, who was unsure if the ball had crossed the boundary, took Ravi Shastri's word and signalled four. However, Jones walked up to umpire Dickie Bird and suggested that it was a six. Dickie then said that the issue would be discussed after Australia's innings. During the innings break, Australian team manager Alan Crompton spoke to the umpires, who then approached India's captain, Kapil Dev. A generous Kapil agreed to change that four to six, which meant India's new target would be 271. Interestingly, India went on to lose the match by 1 run. When Courtney Walsh became Courteous Walsh Pakistan needed 2 runs to win off the last ball in a 1987 World Cup group match at Lahore. Despite the non-striker backing up too much, Courtney Walsh, who was in charge of the last over, liberally refused to effect a run-out. Eventually, Abdul Qadir hit the winning runs and Pakistan won the match by 1 wicket. First player to play for two countries in ODIs Kepler Wessels became the first player to represent two countries in ODI history. He played for Australia from 1982 to 1985, before representing South Africa in 1991. Despite local outrage, Wessels was controversially named as South Africa's captain for the 1992 World Cup. A captain who returned from retirement to win a World Cup Pakistan's World Cup winning captain Imran Khan returned to international cricket in 1988 after announcing his retirement the previous year. It was at the request of the Pakistani President, General Zia-Ul-Haq, that the all-rounder represented the country again. Eventually, his inspirational captaincy gave Pakistan their first World Cup. Angry fans set Eden Gardens ablaze Sachin Tendulkar's dismissal in the 1996 World Cup semifinal triggered a tremendous collapse as India slumped from 98/1 to 120/8. An outrageous crowd then went berserk at the Eden Gardens setting fire in the stands and throwing bottles onto the field. This forced the match officials to stop the match and declare Sri Lanka as winners by default. Umpires ask Cronje to remove ear piece used for communicating with coach During South Africa's 1999 World Cup opener against India, captain Hansie Cronje and Allan Donald wore ear pieces to get instructions from their coach Bob Woolmer. India's Sourav Ganguly noticed Cronje talking to himself and referred the case to the on-field umpires, who then asked both Cronje and Donald to remove the equipment after consulting with the match referee. However, the act was not considered to be against the laws of the game. A review that changed the DRS rule India's review against Ian Bell in the 2011 World Cup forced the International Cricket Council (ICC) to change the DRS rule. Although Hawk-Eye showed the ball hitting a good part of the stumps, Bell was not given out as he was struck outside 2.5 metres from the stumps. The ICC then changed the rule by saying a batsman can be ruled out, if the Hawk-Eye shows the ball hitting the stumps, by a considerable margin, irrespective of the distance between the point of impact and the stumps.

A review that changed the DRS rule India's review against Ian Bell in the 2011 World Cup forced the International Cricket Council (ICC) to change the DRS rule. Although Hawk-Eye showed the ball hitting a good part of the stumps, Bell was not given out as he was struck outside 2.5 metres from the stumps. The ICC then changed the rule by saying a batsman can be ruled out, if the Hawk-Eye shows the ball hitting the stumps, by a considerable margin, irrespective of the distance between the point of impact and the stumps. ©Reuters ©Reuters ©Reuters ©Reuters ©Reuters ©Reuters ©Reuters ©Reuters Livid spectator pleads with Indian batsmen © Cricbuzz ShareTweet TAGS 50 fascinating facts about World Cups ✖ West Indies vs India West Indies vs India Sri Lanka vs Pakistan LIVE South Africa vs England England vs South Africa Scotland vs New Zealand Estonia vs Norway Austria vs Luxembourg France vs Czech Republic Guernsey vs Bulgaria Norway vs Czech Republic Austria vs Slovenia France vs Switzerland Guernsey vs Luxembourg Guernsey vs Austria Estonia vs Switzerland Bulgaria vs Slovenia Norway vs France Switzerland vs Norway Bulgaria vs Luxembourg Madurai Panthers vs Ruby Trichy Warriors Salem Spartans vs Dindigul Dragons Madurai Panthers vs Lyca Kovai Kings Nellai Royal Kings vs Chepauk Super Gillies Essex vs Somerset Warwickshire vs Surrey Lancashire vs Kent Gloucestershire vs Northamptonshire Yorkshire vs Hampshire Durham vs Middlesex Derbyshire vs Worcestershire Nottinghamshire vs Sussex England Women vs South Africa Women Ireland Women vs Pakistan Women 50 FASCINATING FACTS ABOUT WORLD CUPS • Published on Share Tweet Cricbuzz Cricbuzz Share Tweet 54m ago 5h ago 5h ago 12h ago 14h ago 18h ago We use cookies to improve your experience on our site and to show you non-personalized ads.

But their claims for more recognition were further boosted when, three days before the final, they beat India at Old Trafford in the World Cup. The only blemish was their refusal to play Israel on political grounds, but they qualified from their group for the semi-finals by virtue of a faster run-rate, where they beat Denmark. The other semi-final produced an upset as Bermuda were defeated by Canada, who had only qualified for the last four as best runners-up of the three groups. The final was one-sided as Sri Lanka rattled up 324 for 8, although Canada battled well in reaching 264 for 5 in reply. 1982 Venue England Winner Zimbabwe Runner-up Bermuda With holders Sri Lanka having moved up to join the big boys, the second ICC Trophy was more of an open race. Again held in the Midlands, appalling weather blighted the tournament, ironic in the light of the organisers’ decision to move the event from May to June to ensure better weather. Four sides – USA, Gibraltar, Singapore and West Africa – had four games washed out. Zimbabwe and Bermuda, the favourites, emerged from their groups with 100& records and some outstanding performances. Zimbabwe trounced USA by 191 runs after Dave Houghton and Kevin Curran had scored hundreds in their 332 for 4; Bermuda went one better, smashing 348 for 9 against Malaysia in a 284-run win. The surprise package were Papua New Guinea, who beat the fancied Canadians by 20 runs to go through to the semi-finals, where Bangladesh completed the line-up with a win over Holland. Both semis were one-sided affairs, Zimbabwe bowled Bangaldesh out for 124 and passing that for the loss of two wickets, and Bermuda beating Papua New Guinea, who won the third-place play-off, by six wickets. But the final was a good contest. Bermuda made 231 for 8, Duncan Fletcher the pick of the bowlers with 3 for 34, and then Andy Pycroft’s 82 helping them to a five-wicket win with six overs to spare. Zimbabwe qualified for the 1983 World Cup finals. 1986 Venue England Winner Zimbabwe Runner-up Holland Teams 16 Format Two groups, one of seven one of nine, top two into semi-finals In contrast to 1982, the third ICC Trophy was played in good weather with only the final at Lord’s affected to any degree, the game spilling over into a second day after a four-hour rain delay. Again Midlands-based, the fine conditions favoured the batsmen. Simon Myles (Hong Kong) smacked a record 172 on the opening day of the tournament, one of 20 hundreds, and Papua New Guinea amassed 455 for 9 against Gibraltar (on the same day Holland made 425 for 4 against Israel). But there were few surprises in the results. Zimbabwe powered through their group unbeaten, while Holland, Bermuda and Demmark all reached the last four. In a repeat of the 1982 final, Zimbabwe crushed Bermuda by 10 wickets, Grant Paterson (123*) and Robin Brown (81*) putting on 205 in 38.5 overs, while the other semi was won by Holland, whose five-wicket over Denmark was largely thanks to 127 not out from Guyanese-born Rupert Gomes. The final, for which Holland brought more than 1000 spectators, was a good game. Zimbabwe posted 243 for 9, a good recovery from 101 for 4 in an innings which the rain delay robbed of momentum. Brown played the anchor with a 51-over 61, while Andy Waller injected much-needed acceleration at the end. Holland looked in a strong position on 109 for 1 after 30 overs before they lost five wickets for 30. They remained in the hunt until Steve Lubbers seriously damaged his ankle and had to retire, and the tail lacked the firepower to mount a serious challenge. 1990 Venue Holland Winner Zimbabwe Runner-up Holland Teams 17 Format Four groups, then two groups of four in the quarter-finals, top two into semi-finals The first sponsored tournament produced a repeat of the 1986 final, and again Zimbabwe triumphed over hosts Holland, in front of 3000 spectators at the HCC ground in the Hague, their well-paced chase being led by Andy Flower (69*). The early stages produced little remarkable, but it was apparent early on that Zimbabwe were a class apart. As expected, they eased into the final with an 84-run win over Bangladesh, while Holland beat Kenya thanks to P-J Baaker’s 6 for 41 (he had returned from county duty). 1993-94 Venue Kenya Winner UAE Runner-up Kenya Teams 16 Format Four groups, then two groups of four in the quarter-finals, top two into semi-finals The first tournament held outside Europe, and once again and open event with three-time winners Zimbabwe elevated to Test status. The start of the matches brought an end to a two-month drought, but thereafter the climate was ideal. The most contentious matter was the eligibility of players, the UAE attracting the most criticism as their squad of ex-pats contained only one home-grown cricketer – Sultan Zarawani, the captain. It was, in view of that, rather disappointing that they won the Trophy. The group stages produced little in terms of upsets, although group B was close, with two teams of ex-pats, the UAE and USA, battling with the home-grown Bangladeshis. The USA had the talent but lacked any discipline and they lost out. In the semi-finals, Kenya’s batting proved too much for Bermuda, their 318 for 5 led by Maurice Odumbe’s unbeaten 158, while UAE eased to a six-wicket win over Holland. Kenya seemed to have posted a winning total when they reached 281 for 6 in the final, Odumbe again top scoring with 86 and adding a hundred for the second successive match with Steve Tikolo. But UAE timed their chase to perfection, winning by two wickets with five balls in hand. Holland won the third-place play-off to book the third and final berth in the 1996 World Cup. 1997 Venue Malaysia Winner Bangladesh Runner-up Kenya Teams 16 Format Four groups, then two groups of four in the quarter-finals, top two into semi-finals The sixth ICC Trophy was bedeviled with problems, the most serious being that the Malaysians’ assurance that turf wickets would be in place was not fulfilled and so matches were played on artificial wickets. The outfields were also less than perfect, and overall the conditions were not up to the expected standard. To add to the difficulties, the weather was increasingly dreadful and one of the semi-finals, the third-place play-off and the final were all played over two days. On the field, the gulf between the big boys and the minnows was all too apparent, but Singapore came close to beating Kenya and Hong Kong beated Bermuda, one of the favourites, by three wickets. There was also a near-farcical protest when Islamic fundamentalists turned up to disrupt the Israel-Gibraltar game – the authorities had been tipped off and switched venues with the Canada-Holland tie, although the demonstrators refused to believe the authorities and started bonfires on the outfield causing the game to be abandoned. The quarter-finals onwards were disrupted by the weather, with Holland’s hopes hammered by a D/L loss to Hong Kong while other games were washed out. Kenya had an excellent half-century from Maurice Odumbe (who averaged 98.60) to thank for bailing them out after Ireland had them tied down, and then Ireland came within seven runs of beating them. In the other match, Scotland were well beaten by Bangladesh, whose large traveling support gave them excellent support. Kenya looked likely winners of the two-day final, with the previously out-of-form Steve Tikolo hammering 147 and adding 138 for the fourth wicket with Odumbe (43) as they reached 241 for 7. But rain and D/L reduced Bangladesh’s target to 166 in 25 overs. The chase was frantic, and they started the last over needing 11 with two wickets in hand. It all came down to the last ball, and Hasibul Hussain missed but scrambled a leg-bye. The third-place play-off, which decided the third qualifier for the 1999 World Cup, was won fairly comfortably by Scotland. 2001 Venue Canada Winner Holland Runner-up Namibia Teams 22 Format Four groups, then a Super League, top two into final The largest competition yet – even allowing for the late withdrawal of Italy and West Africa – with a new format involving a Super League. As was to prove the case in the main World Cup two years later, the early matches were often one-sided, and the system of carrying forward points to the second stage was far from popular and gave the two group winners – Holland and Namibia – a distinct advantage, although Scotland ran them close. In fairness, Namibia were the surprise package, and only when they met Holland in the final did their inexperience show. In a low-scoring match, Holland were 106 for 6 with 13 over remaining, chasing 196, but a 51-ball 58 not out from Jacob-Jan Esmeijer guided them to a two-wicket victory off the last ball. Scotland, who had effectively thrown away their final Super League match, were livid that third place in that had not secured them an automatic World Cup berth, were soundly beaten by Canada in the play-off. A brief history A result of the success of the inaugural 1975 World Cup, the ICC trophy was launched for all ICC Associate members in 1979 and the first tournament ran ahead of the main World Cup, with the finalists offered the additional prize of being included in the competition proper. 1979 Venue England Winner Sri Lanka Runner-up Canada As widely expected, Sri Lanka, pushing hard for Test status, won the competition, which was based at club grounds across the Midlands, although they were indebted to their depth of batting as their bowling was generally weak.

As expected, they eased into the final with an 84-run win over Bangladesh, while Holland beat Kenya thanks to P-J Baaker’s 6 for 41 (he had returned from county duty). 1993-94 Venue Kenya Winner UAE Runner-up Kenya Teams 16 Format Four groups, then two groups of four in the quarter-finals, top two into semi-finals The first tournament held outside Europe, and once again and open event with three-time winners Zimbabwe elevated to Test status. The start of the matches brought an end to a two-month drought, but thereafter the climate was ideal. The most contentious matter was the eligibility of players, the UAE attracting the most criticism as their squad of ex-pats contained only one home-grown cricketer – Sultan Zarawani, the captain. It was, in view of that, rather disappointing that they won the Trophy. The group stages produced little in terms of upsets, although group B was close, with two teams of ex-pats, the UAE and USA, battling with the home-grown Bangladeshis. The USA had the talent but lacked any discipline and they lost out. In the semi-finals, Kenya’s batting proved too much for Bermuda, their 318 for 5 led by Maurice Odumbe’s unbeaten 158, while UAE eased to a six-wicket win over Holland. Kenya seemed to have posted a winning total when they reached 281 for 6 in the final, Odumbe again top scoring with 86 and adding a hundred for the second successive match with Steve Tikolo. But UAE timed their chase to perfection, winning by two wickets with five balls in hand. Holland won the third-place play-off to book the third and final berth in the 1996 World Cup. 1997 Venue Malaysia Winner Bangladesh Runner-up Kenya Teams 16 Format Four groups, then two groups of four in the quarter-finals, top two into semi-finals The sixth ICC Trophy was bedeviled with problems, the most serious being that the Malaysians’ assurance that turf wickets would be in place was not fulfilled and so matches were played on artificial wickets. The outfields were also less than perfect, and overall the conditions were not up to the expected standard. To add to the difficulties, the weather was increasingly dreadful and one of the semi-finals, the third-place play-off and the final were all played over two days. On the field, the gulf between the big boys and the minnows was all too apparent, but Singapore came close to beating Kenya and Hong Kong beated Bermuda, one of the favourites, by three wickets. There was also a near-farcical protest when Islamic fundamentalists turned up to disrupt the Israel-Gibraltar game – the authorities had been tipped off and switched venues with the Canada-Holland tie, although the demonstrators refused to believe the authorities and started bonfires on the outfield causing the game to be abandoned. The quarter-finals onwards were disrupted by the weather, with Holland’s hopes hammered by a D/L loss to Hong Kong while other games were washed out. Kenya had an excellent half-century from Maurice Odumbe (who averaged 98.60) to thank for bailing them out after Ireland had them tied down, and then Ireland came within seven runs of beating them. In the other match, Scotland were well beaten by Bangladesh, whose large traveling support gave them excellent support. Kenya looked likely winners of the two-day final, with the previously out-of-form Steve Tikolo hammering 147 and adding 138 for the fourth wicket with Odumbe (43) as they reached 241 for 7. But rain and D/L reduced Bangladesh’s target to 166 in 25 overs. The chase was frantic, and they started the last over needing 11 with two wickets in hand. It all came down to the last ball, and Hasibul Hussain missed but scrambled a leg-bye. The third-place play-off, which decided the third qualifier for the 1999 World Cup, was won fairly comfortably by Scotland. 2001 Venue Canada Winner Holland Runner-up Namibia Teams 22 Format Four groups, then a Super League, top two into final The largest competition yet – even allowing for the late withdrawal of Italy and West Africa – with a new format involving a Super League. As was to prove the case in the main World Cup two years later, the early matches were often one-sided, and the system of carrying forward points to the second stage was far from popular and gave the two group winners – Holland and Namibia – a distinct advantage, although Scotland ran them close. In fairness, Namibia were the surprise package, and only when they met Holland in the final did their inexperience show. In a low-scoring match, Holland were 106 for 6 with 13 over remaining, chasing 196, but a 51-ball 58 not out from Jacob-Jan Esmeijer guided them to a two-wicket victory off the last ball. Scotland, who had effectively thrown away their final Super League match, were livid that third place in that had not secured them an automatic World Cup berth, were soundly beaten by Canada in the play-off. 1986 Venue England Winner Zimbabwe Runner-up Holland Teams 16 Format Two groups, one of seven one of nine, top two into semi-finals In contrast to 1982, the third ICC Trophy was played in good weather with only the final at Lord’s affected to any degree, the game spilling over into a second day after a four-hour rain delay. Again Midlands-based, the fine conditions favoured the batsmen. Simon Myles (Hong Kong) smacked a record 172 on the opening day of the tournament, one of 20 hundreds, and Papua New Guinea amassed 455 for 9 against Gibraltar (on the same day Holland made 425 for 4 against Israel). But there were few surprises in the results. Zimbabwe powered through their group unbeaten, while Holland, Bermuda and Demmark all reached the last four. In a repeat of the 1982 final, Zimbabwe crushed Bermuda by 10 wickets, Grant Paterson (123*) and Robin Brown (81*) putting on 205 in 38.5 overs, while the other semi was won by Holland, whose five-wicket over Denmark was largely thanks to 127 not out from Guyanese-born Rupert Gomes. The final, for which Holland brought more than 1000 spectators, was a good game. Zimbabwe posted 243 for 9, a good recovery from 101 for 4 in an innings which the rain delay robbed of momentum. Brown played the anchor with a 51-over 61, while Andy Waller injected much-needed acceleration at the end. Holland looked in a strong position on 109 for 1 after 30 overs before they lost five wickets for 30. They remained in the hunt until Steve Lubbers seriously damaged his ankle and had to retire, and the tail lacked the firepower to mount a serious challenge. 1990 Venue Holland Winner Zimbabwe Runner-up Holland Teams 17 Format Four groups, then two groups of four in the quarter-finals, top two into semi-finals The first sponsored tournament produced a repeat of the 1986 final, and again Zimbabwe triumphed over hosts Holland, in front of 3000 spectators at the HCC ground in the Hague, their well-paced chase being led by Andy Flower (69*).

But their claims for more recognition were further boosted when, three days before the final, they beat India at Old Trafford in the World Cup. The only blemish was their refusal to play Israel on political grounds, but they qualified from their group for the semi-finals by virtue of a faster run-rate, where they beat Denmark. The other semi-final produced an upset as Bermuda were defeated by Canada, who had only qualified for the last four as best runners-up of the three groups. The final was one-sided as Sri Lanka rattled up 324 for 8, although Canada battled well in reaching 264 for 5 in reply. 1982 Venue England Winner Zimbabwe Runner-up Bermuda With holders Sri Lanka having moved up to join the big boys, the second ICC Trophy was more of an open race. Again held in the Midlands, appalling weather blighted the tournament, ironic in the light of the organisers’ decision to move the event from May to June to ensure better weather. Four sides – USA, Gibraltar, Singapore and West Africa – had four games washed out. Zimbabwe and Bermuda, the favourites, emerged from their groups with 100& records and some outstanding performances. Zimbabwe trounced USA by 191 runs after Dave Houghton and Kevin Curran had scored hundreds in their 332 for 4; Bermuda went one better, smashing 348 for 9 against Malaysia in a 284-run win. The surprise package were Papua New Guinea, who beat the fancied Canadians by 20 runs to go through to the semi-finals, where Bangladesh completed the line-up with a win over Holland. Both semis were one-sided affairs, Zimbabwe bowled Bangaldesh out for 124 and passing that for the loss of two wickets, and Bermuda beating Papua New Guinea, who won the third-place play-off, by six wickets. But the final was a good contest. Bermuda made 231 for 8, Duncan Fletcher the pick of the bowlers with 3 for 34, and then Andy Pycroft’s 82 helping them to a five-wicket win with six overs to spare. Zimbabwe qualified for the 1983 World Cup finals. 1986 Venue England Winner Zimbabwe Runner-up Holland Teams 16 Format Two groups, one of seven one of nine, top two into semi-finals In contrast to 1982, the third ICC Trophy was played in good weather with only the final at Lord’s affected to any degree, the game spilling over into a second day after a four-hour rain delay. Again Midlands-based, the fine conditions favoured the batsmen. Simon Myles (Hong Kong) smacked a record 172 on the opening day of the tournament, one of 20 hundreds, and Papua New Guinea amassed 455 for 9 against Gibraltar (on the same day Holland made 425 for 4 against Israel). But there were few surprises in the results. Zimbabwe powered through their group unbeaten, while Holland, Bermuda and Demmark all reached the last four. In a repeat of the 1982 final, Zimbabwe crushed Bermuda by 10 wickets, Grant Paterson (123*) and Robin Brown (81*) putting on 205 in 38.5 overs, while the other semi was won by Holland, whose five-wicket over Denmark was largely thanks to 127 not out from Guyanese-born Rupert Gomes. The final, for which Holland brought more than 1000 spectators, was a good game. Zimbabwe posted 243 for 9, a good recovery from 101 for 4 in an innings which the rain delay robbed of momentum. Brown played the anchor with a 51-over 61, while Andy Waller injected much-needed acceleration at the end. Holland looked in a strong position on 109 for 1 after 30 overs before they lost five wickets for 30. They remained in the hunt until Steve Lubbers seriously damaged his ankle and had to retire, and the tail lacked the firepower to mount a serious challenge. 1990 Venue Holland Winner Zimbabwe Runner-up Holland Teams 17 Format Four groups, then two groups of four in the quarter-finals, top two into semi-finals The first sponsored tournament produced a repeat of the 1986 final, and again Zimbabwe triumphed over hosts Holland, in front of 3000 spectators at the HCC ground in the Hague, their well-paced chase being led by Andy Flower (69*). The early stages produced little remarkable, but it was apparent early on that Zimbabwe were a class apart. As expected, they eased into the final with an 84-run win over Bangladesh, while Holland beat Kenya thanks to P-J Baaker’s 6 for 41 (he had returned from county duty). 1993-94 Venue Kenya Winner UAE Runner-up Kenya Teams 16 Format Four groups, then two groups of four in the quarter-finals, top two into semi-finals The first tournament held outside Europe, and once again and open event with three-time winners Zimbabwe elevated to Test status. The start of the matches brought an end to a two-month drought, but thereafter the climate was ideal. The most contentious matter was the eligibility of players, the UAE attracting the most criticism as their squad of ex-pats contained only one home-grown cricketer – Sultan Zarawani, the captain. It was, in view of that, rather disappointing that they won the Trophy. The group stages produced little in terms of upsets, although group B was close, with two teams of ex-pats, the UAE and USA, battling with the home-grown Bangladeshis. The USA had the talent but lacked any discipline and they lost out. In the semi-finals, Kenya’s batting proved too much for Bermuda, their 318 for 5 led by Maurice Odumbe’s unbeaten 158, while UAE eased to a six-wicket win over Holland. Kenya seemed to have posted a winning total when they reached 281 for 6 in the final, Odumbe again top scoring with 86 and adding a hundred for the second successive match with Steve Tikolo. But UAE timed their chase to perfection, winning by two wickets with five balls in hand. Holland won the third-place play-off to book the third and final berth in the 1996 World Cup. 1997 Venue Malaysia Winner Bangladesh Runner-up Kenya Teams 16 Format Four groups, then two groups of four in the quarter-finals, top two into semi-finals The sixth ICC Trophy was bedeviled with problems, the most serious being that the Malaysians’ assurance that turf wickets would be in place was not fulfilled and so matches were played on artificial wickets. The outfields were also less than perfect, and overall the conditions were not up to the expected standard. To add to the difficulties, the weather was increasingly dreadful and one of the semi-finals, the third-place play-off and the final were all played over two days. On the field, the gulf between the big boys and the minnows was all too apparent, but Singapore came close to beating Kenya and Hong Kong beated Bermuda, one of the favourites, by three wickets. There was also a near-farcical protest when Islamic fundamentalists turned up to disrupt the Israel-Gibraltar game – the authorities had been tipped off and switched venues with the Canada-Holland tie, although the demonstrators refused to believe the authorities and started bonfires on the outfield causing the game to be abandoned. The quarter-finals onwards were disrupted by the weather, with Holland’s hopes hammered by a D/L loss to Hong Kong while other games were washed out. Kenya had an excellent half-century from Maurice Odumbe (who averaged 98.60) to thank for bailing them out after Ireland had them tied down, and then Ireland came within seven runs of beating them. In the other match, Scotland were well beaten by Bangladesh, whose large traveling support gave them excellent support. Kenya looked likely winners of the two-day final, with the previously out-of-form Steve Tikolo hammering 147 and adding 138 for the fourth wicket with Odumbe (43) as they reached 241 for 7. But rain and D/L reduced Bangladesh’s target to 166 in 25 overs. The chase was frantic, and they started the last over needing 11 with two wickets in hand. It all came down to the last ball, and Hasibul Hussain missed but scrambled a leg-bye. The third-place play-off, which decided the third qualifier for the 1999 World Cup, was won fairly comfortably by Scotland. 2001 Venue Canada Winner Holland Runner-up Namibia Teams 22 Format Four groups, then a Super League, top two into final The largest competition yet – even allowing for the late withdrawal of Italy and West Africa – with a new format involving a Super League. As was to prove the case in the main World Cup two years later, the early matches were often one-sided, and the system of carrying forward points to the second stage was far from popular and gave the two group winners – Holland and Namibia – a distinct advantage, although Scotland ran them close. In fairness, Namibia were the surprise package, and only when they met Holland in the final did their inexperience show. In a low-scoring match, Holland were 106 for 6 with 13 over remaining, chasing 196, but a 51-ball 58 not out from Jacob-Jan Esmeijer guided them to a two-wicket victory off the last ball. Scotland, who had effectively thrown away their final Super League match, were livid that third place in that had not secured them an automatic World Cup berth, were soundly beaten by Canada in the play-off. A brief history A result of the success of the inaugural 1975 World Cup, the ICC trophy was launched for all ICC Associate members in 1979 and the first tournament ran ahead of the main World Cup, with the finalists offered the additional prize of being included in the competition proper. 1979 Venue England Winner Sri Lanka Runner-up Canada As widely expected, Sri Lanka, pushing hard for Test status, won the competition, which was based at club grounds across the Midlands, although they were indebted to their depth of batting as their bowling was generally weak. But their claims for more recognition were further boosted when, three days before the final, they beat India at Old Trafford in the World Cup. The only blemish was their refusal to play Israel on political grounds, but they qualified from their group for the semi-finals by virtue of a faster run-rate, where they beat Denmark. The other semi-final produced an upset as Bermuda were defeated by Canada, who had only qualified for the last four as best runners-up of the three groups. The final was one-sided as Sri Lanka rattled up 324 for 8, although Canada battled well in reaching 264 for 5 in reply. 1982 Venue England Winner Zimbabwe Runner-up Bermuda With holders Sri Lanka having moved up to join the big boys, the second ICC Trophy was more of an open race. Again held in the Midlands, appalling weather blighted the tournament, ironic in the light of the organisers’ decision to move the event from May to June to ensure better weather. Four sides – USA, Gibraltar, Singapore and West Africa – had four games washed out. Zimbabwe and Bermuda, the favourites, emerged from their groups with 100& records and some outstanding performances. Zimbabwe trounced USA by 191 runs after Dave Houghton and Kevin Curran had scored hundreds in their 332 for 4; Bermuda went one better, smashing 348 for 9 against Malaysia in a 284-run win. The surprise package were Papua New Guinea, who beat the fancied Canadians by 20 runs to go through to the semi-finals, where Bangladesh completed the line-up with a win over Holland. Both semis were one-sided affairs, Zimbabwe bowled Bangaldesh out for 124 and passing that for the loss of two wickets, and Bermuda beating Papua New Guinea, who won the third-place play-off, by six wickets. But the final was a good contest. Bermuda made 231 for 8, Duncan Fletcher the pick of the bowlers with 3 for 34, and then Andy Pycroft’s 82 helping them to a five-wicket win with six overs to spare. Zimbabwe qualified for the 1983 World Cup finals. 1986 Venue England Winner Zimbabwe Runner-up Holland Teams 16 Format Two groups, one of seven one of nine, top two into semi-finals In contrast to 1982, the third ICC Trophy was played in good weather with only the final at Lord’s affected to any degree, the game spilling over into a second day after a four-hour rain delay. Again Midlands-based, the fine conditions favoured the batsmen. Simon Myles (Hong Kong) smacked a record 172 on the opening day of the tournament, one of 20 hundreds, and Papua New Guinea amassed 455 for 9 against Gibraltar (on the same day Holland made 425 for 4 against Israel). But there were few surprises in the results. Zimbabwe powered through their group unbeaten, while Holland, Bermuda and Demmark all reached the last four. In a repeat of the 1982 final, Zimbabwe crushed Bermuda by 10 wickets, Grant Paterson (123*) and Robin Brown (81*) putting on 205 in 38.5 overs, while the other semi was won by Holland, whose five-wicket over Denmark was largely thanks to 127 not out from Guyanese-born Rupert Gomes. The final, for which Holland brought more than 1000 spectators, was a good game. Zimbabwe posted 243 for 9, a good recovery from 101 for 4 in an innings which the rain delay robbed of momentum. Brown played the anchor with a 51-over 61, while Andy Waller injected much-needed acceleration at the end. Holland looked in a strong position on 109 for 1 after 30 overs before they lost five wickets for 30. They remained in the hunt until Steve Lubbers seriously damaged his ankle and had to retire, and the tail lacked the firepower to mount a serious challenge. 1990 Venue Holland Winner Zimbabwe Runner-up Holland Teams 17 Format Four groups, then two groups of four in the quarter-finals, top two into semi-finals The first sponsored tournament produced a repeat of the 1986 final, and again Zimbabwe triumphed over hosts Holland, in front of 3000 spectators at the HCC ground in the Hague, their well-paced chase being led by Andy Flower (69*). The early stages produced little remarkable, but it was apparent early on that Zimbabwe were a class apart. As expected, they eased into the final with an 84-run win over Bangladesh, while Holland beat Kenya thanks to P-J Baaker’s 6 for 41 (he had returned from county duty). 1993-94 Venue Kenya Winner UAE Runner-up Kenya Teams 16 Format Four groups, then two groups of four in the quarter-finals, top two into semi-finals The first tournament held outside Europe, and once again and open event with three-time winners Zimbabwe elevated to Test status. The start of the matches brought an end to a two-month drought, but thereafter the climate was ideal. The most contentious matter was the eligibility of players, the UAE attracting the most criticism as their squad of ex-pats contained only one home-grown cricketer – Sultan Zarawani, the captain. It was, in view of that, rather disappointing that they won the Trophy. The group stages produced little in terms of upsets, although group B was close, with two teams of ex-pats, the UAE and USA, battling with the home-grown Bangladeshis. The USA had the talent but lacked any discipline and they lost out. In the semi-finals, Kenya’s batting proved too much for Bermuda, their 318 for 5 led by Maurice Odumbe’s unbeaten 158, while UAE eased to a six-wicket win over Holland. Kenya seemed to have posted a winning total when they reached 281 for 6 in the final, Odumbe again top scoring with 86 and adding a hundred for the second successive match with Steve Tikolo. But UAE timed their chase to perfection, winning by two wickets with five balls in hand. Holland won the third-place play-off to book the third and final berth in the 1996 World Cup. 1997 Venue Malaysia Winner Bangladesh Runner-up Kenya Teams 16 Format Four groups, then two groups of four in the quarter-finals, top two into semi-finals The sixth ICC Trophy was bedeviled with problems, the most serious being that the Malaysians’ assurance that turf wickets would be in place was not fulfilled and so matches were played on artificial wickets. The outfields were also less than perfect, and overall the conditions were not up to the expected standard. To add to the difficulties, the weather was increasingly dreadful and one of the semi-finals, the third-place play-off and the final were all played over two days. On the field, the gulf between the big boys and the minnows was all too apparent, but Singapore came close to beating Kenya and Hong Kong beated Bermuda, one of the favourites, by three wickets.

Holland won the third-place play-off to book the third and final berth in the 1996 World Cup. 1997 Venue Malaysia Winner Bangladesh Runner-up Kenya Teams 16 Format Four groups, then two groups of four in the quarter-finals, top two into semi-finals The sixth ICC Trophy was bedeviled with problems, the most serious being that the Malaysians’ assurance that turf wickets would be in place was not fulfilled and so matches were played on artificial wickets. The outfields were also less than perfect, and overall the conditions were not up to the expected standard. To add to the difficulties, the weather was increasingly dreadful and one of the semi-finals, the third-place play-off and the final were all played over two days. On the field, the gulf between the big boys and the minnows was all too apparent, but Singapore came close to beating Kenya and Hong Kong beated Bermuda, one of the favourites, by three wickets. There was also a near-farcical protest when Islamic fundamentalists turned up to disrupt the Israel-Gibraltar game – the authorities had been tipped off and switched venues with the Canada-Holland tie, although the demonstrators refused to believe the authorities and started bonfires on the outfield causing the game to be abandoned. The quarter-finals onwards were disrupted by the weather, with Holland’s hopes hammered by a D/L loss to Hong Kong while other games were washed out. Kenya had an excellent half-century from Maurice Odumbe (who averaged 98.60) to thank for bailing them out after Ireland had them tied down, and then Ireland came within seven runs of beating them. In the other match, Scotland were well beaten by Bangladesh, whose large traveling support gave them excellent support. Kenya looked likely winners of the two-day final, with the previously out-of-form Steve Tikolo hammering 147 and adding 138 for the fourth wicket with Odumbe (43) as they reached 241 for 7. But rain and D/L reduced Bangladesh’s target to 166 in 25 overs. The chase was frantic, and they started the last over needing 11 with two wickets in hand. It all came down to the last ball, and Hasibul Hussain missed but scrambled a leg-bye. The third-place play-off, which decided the third qualifier for the 1999 World Cup, was won fairly comfortably by Scotland. 2001 Venue Canada Winner Holland Runner-up Namibia Teams 22 Format Four groups, then a Super League, top two into final The largest competition yet – even allowing for the late withdrawal of Italy and West Africa – with a new format involving a Super League. As was to prove the case in the main World Cup two years later, the early matches were often one-sided, and the system of carrying forward points to the second stage was far from popular and gave the two group winners – Holland and Namibia – a distinct advantage, although Scotland ran them close. In fairness, Namibia were the surprise package, and only when they met Holland in the final did their inexperience show. In a low-scoring match, Holland were 106 for 6 with 13 over remaining, chasing 196, but a 51-ball 58 not out from Jacob-Jan Esmeijer guided them to a two-wicket victory off the last ball. Scotland, who had effectively thrown away their final Super League match, were livid that third place in that had not secured them an automatic World Cup berth, were soundly beaten by Canada in the play-off. 1990 Venue Holland Winner Zimbabwe Runner-up Holland Teams 17 Format Four groups, then two groups of four in the quarter-finals, top two into semi-finals The first sponsored tournament produced a repeat of the 1986 final, and again Zimbabwe triumphed over hosts Holland, in front of 3000 spectators at the HCC ground in the Hague, their well-paced chase being led by Andy Flower (69*). The early stages produced little remarkable, but it was apparent early on that Zimbabwe were a class apart. As expected, they eased into the final with an 84-run win over Bangladesh, while Holland beat Kenya thanks to P-J Baaker’s 6 for 41 (he had returned from county duty). 1993-94 Venue Kenya Winner UAE Runner-up Kenya Teams 16 Format Four groups, then two groups of four in the quarter-finals, top two into semi-finals The first tournament held outside Europe, and once again and open event with three-time winners Zimbabwe elevated to Test status. The start of the matches brought an end to a two-month drought, but thereafter the climate was ideal. The most contentious matter was the eligibility of players, the UAE attracting the most criticism as their squad of ex-pats contained only one home-grown cricketer – Sultan Zarawani, the captain. It was, in view of that, rather disappointing that they won the Trophy. The group stages produced little in terms of upsets, although group B was close, with two teams of ex-pats, the UAE and USA, battling with the home-grown Bangladeshis. The USA had the talent but lacked any discipline and they lost out. In the semi-finals, Kenya’s batting proved too much for Bermuda, their 318 for 5 led by Maurice Odumbe’s unbeaten 158, while UAE eased to a six-wicket win over Holland. Kenya seemed to have posted a winning total when they reached 281 for 6 in the final, Odumbe again top scoring with 86 and adding a hundred for the second successive match with Steve Tikolo. But UAE timed their chase to perfection, winning by two wickets with five balls in hand. Holland won the third-place play-off to book the third and final berth in the 1996 World Cup. 1997 Venue Malaysia Winner Bangladesh Runner-up Kenya Teams 16 Format Four groups, then two groups of four in the quarter-finals, top two into semi-finals The sixth ICC Trophy was bedeviled with problems, the most serious being that the Malaysians’ assurance that turf wickets would be in place was not fulfilled and so matches were played on artificial wickets.

It still proved to be fundamentally flawed, as boycotts of matches in Kenya and Zimbabwe, on political and safety grounds, skewed points so much that Kenya reached the semi-finals courtesy of wins over Bangladesh, Canada and Sri Lanka.Innovations The bloated schedule, resulting from an increase to 14 teams from 12, led to many meaningless one-sided matches. \"It was simply too big and too long,\" Wisden noted, and considering the tournament ran over more than six weeks, it was hard to disagree. The extra matches also forced reserve days to be scrapped, even though the competition was being held late in South Africa's cricketing year, resulting in two washouts, which effectively eliminated Pakistan and West Indies. The experiment with Hawk-Eye, trialled in the Champions Trophy a few months earlier, was not continued. Relay throwing made its first appearance.Early running The competition began with a tense game between South Africa and West Indies. At the time, the hosts' defeat looked a mere hiccup; a ridiculous miscalculation in their final group game meant it contributed to their exit, with a resulting tailing off in local interest. Canada briefly enlivened proceedings when they beat Bangladesh, although Bangladesh's performances underlined how poor a side they were. Kenya qualified for the Super Sixes courtesy of a forfeit when New Zealand refused to play in Nairobi. Zimbabwe progressed thanks to England's boycott of Harare and the points they got in the abandoned match against Pakistan, but their every move was overshadowed by internal politics.Super Six Australia were all but guaranteed a semi-final berth before they started, while Kenya and Sri Lanka only had to beat Zimbabwe to do the same. India joined those three with convincing wins in all their matches. But while the presence of two minnows pleased neutrals, the absence of many big names, including the hosts, meant a number games were played in front of empty stands.Teams 14Games 52 (two forfeited)Hosts South Africa, Zimbabwe and KenyaVenues 15Format Two groups of seven, top three from each go to Super Sixes, from which semi-finalists are chosenWinners Australia; Runners-up IndiaMan of the Series Sachin TendulkarPrize money Total US$4.6m, Winners $2m, Runners-up $800,000Attendance 626, 845The semis India were never going to slip against a keen but limited Kenyan side, especially in front of a capacity crowd that outnumbered the Africans by about 100 to one. Sourav Ganguly hit a hundred and from then on the players did little more than go through the motions. Australia survived uneasy moments to see off Sri Lanka, with Brett Lee restoring the world order after Australia had limped to 212 for 7. Although rain ended the game early, the result had long since been known.The final It was as one-sided as the final in 1999. So savage was the attack led by Ricky Ponting (140 not out off 121 balls), with support from Damien Martyn and Adam Gilchrist, that Australia were never under threat. Sourav Ganguly went down guns blazing, and a rain break, preceded by Ponting desperately asking his spinners to race through overs to ensure a result, did briefly stir the crowd.

Australia: Ricky Ponting (captain), Adam Gilchrist, Matthew Hayden, Damien Martyn, Darren Lehmann, Michael Bevan, Andrew Symonds, Andy Bichel, Brad Hogg, Brett Lee, Glenn McGrath.

Umpires: David Shepherd, England, and Steve Bucknor, West Indies. And in securing their third World Cup triumph, Australia also became the only side to win all of their matches in a World Cup tournament. Captain Sourav Ganguly's decision to bowl first when he won the toss backfired spectacularly. Ponting and Damien Martyn shared a partnership of 234 to take Australia well past the previous highest score in a final - the West Indies' 291 (off 60 overs) in 1975. World Cup final; Over-by-over Martyn's 88, from 84 balls, was completely overshadowed by Ponting, as was the opening stand of 105 between Adam Gilchrist and Matthew Hayden. There was some evidence of the early dampness in the pitch that was behind Ganguly's surprise decision, but his nervous pace attack failed to use it.

Zaheer, deposited into the second tier of the stand at the Golf Course End by Ponting off the penultimate ball of the innings, finished with none for 67 from seven overs. Gilchrist dominated the early overs, hitting 57 off 48 balls before over-reaching on a slog-sweep at spinner Harbhajan Singh. Harbhajan also dismissed Hayden, caught behind for 37 edging at a ball that came across his body. But he was only brought back into the attack in time to see Ponting complete his half-century in the 39th over. India didn't give their fans much to shout about View from our man at the final And Ponting then hit the accelerator, smacking consecutive sixes off the spinner on the way to completing his second 50 in just 29 balls. India tried bravely to keep pace with a required run rate of 7.2 per over from the off. But man of the tournament Sachin Tendulkar lasted just four balls before lofting Glenn McGrath a return catch. The innings could have been cut down shortly afterwards had Brett Lee not over-stepped when he had Sehwag, on four at the time, caught at square leg. But Sehwag made the most of his let-off. After Ganguly mistimed Lee to mid-on for 24, Sehwag and Rahul Dravid added 88 for the fourth wicket in 13 overs, either side of a 25-minute break for rain. But the stand was brought to an abrupt halt when Lehmann's sharp throw from mid-off beat Sehwag as he scurried to add to his 82, which included 10 fours and three sixes.

India didn't give their fans much to shout about View from our man at the final And Ponting then hit the accelerator, smacking consecutive sixes off the spinner on the way to completing his second 50 in just 29 balls. India tried bravely to keep pace with a required run rate of 7.2 per over from the off. But man of the tournament Sachin Tendulkar lasted just four balls before lofting Glenn McGrath a return catch. The innings could have been cut down shortly afterwards had Brett Lee not over-stepped when he had Sehwag, on four at the time, caught at square leg. But Sehwag made the most of his let-off. After Ganguly mistimed Lee to mid-on for 24, Sehwag and Rahul Dravid added 88 for the fourth wicket in 13 overs, either side of a 25-minute break for rain. But the stand was brought to an abrupt halt when Lehmann's sharp throw from mid-off beat Sehwag as he scurried to add to his 82, which included 10 fours and three sixes.

First was Dravid for 47, playing on to Bichel in an attempt to drive through the off-side. Having been dropped three times, Yuvraj Singh followed for 24, taken at midwicket off Hogg. And Martyn's spectacular diving catch to dismiss Dinesh Mongia effectively finished the contest in the 36th over, the first of two wickets for medium-pacer Andrew Symonds.

Umpires: David Shepherd, England, and Steve Bucknor, West Indies. Despite a fighting 82 from Virender Sehwag, India could only make 234. And in securing their third World Cup triumph, Australia also became the only side to win all of their matches in a World Cup tournament. Captain Sourav Ganguly's decision to bowl first when he won the toss backfired spectacularly. Ponting and Damien Martyn shared a partnership of 234 to take Australia well past the previous highest score in a final - the West Indies' 291 (off 60 overs) in 1975. World Cup final; Over-by-over Martyn's 88, from 84 balls, was completely overshadowed by Ponting, as was the opening stand of 105 between Adam Gilchrist and Matthew Hayden. There was some evidence of the early dampness in the pitch that was behind Ganguly's surprise decision, but his nervous pace attack failed to use it.

Harbhajan also dismissed Hayden, caught behind for 37 edging at a ball that came across his body. But he was only brought back into the attack in time to see Ponting complete his half-century in the 39th over. India didn't give their fans much to shout about View from our man at the final And Ponting then hit the accelerator, smacking consecutive sixes off the spinner on the way to completing his second 50 in just 29 balls. India tried bravely to keep pace with a required run rate of 7.2 per over from the off. But man of the tournament Sachin Tendulkar lasted just four balls before lofting Glenn McGrath a return catch. The innings could have been cut down shortly afterwards had Brett Lee not over-stepped when he had Sehwag, on four at the time, caught at square leg. But Sehwag made the most of his let-off. After Ganguly mistimed Lee to mid-on for 24, Sehwag and Rahul Dravid added 88 for the fourth wicket in 13 overs, either side of a 25-minute break for rain. But the stand was brought to an abrupt halt when Lehmann's sharp throw from mid-off beat Sehwag as he scurried to add to his 82, which included 10 fours and three sixes. HAVE YOUR SAY Australia totally crushed India. They are a great team and deserve to be the champions From Tanya Khokhar, New York Join the debate Ponting stuck with his top for bowlers for as long as possible and as the pressure grew the wickets came. First was Dravid for 47, playing on to Bichel in an attempt to drive through the off-side. Having been dropped three times, Yuvraj Singh followed for 24, taken at midwicket off Hogg. And Martyn's spectacular diving catch to dismiss Dinesh Mongia effectively finished the contest in the 36th over, the first of two wickets for medium-pacer Andrew Symonds.

Cricinfo staff18-Mar-2007 Bob Woolmer was found unconscious in his hotel room © Martin Williamson A pall of gloom fell over the World Cup following the death of Bob Woolmer, the Pakistan coach, in hospital in Jamaica on Sunday, hours after he was found unconscious on the floor of his hotel room. He was 58.Tributes poured in from across the cricketing world, where Woolmer was known as an innovative coach and a scholar of the game. The Pakistan team, already eliminated from the World Cup on Saturday, said it would play its final match, against Zimbabwe, on Wednesday as scheduled.\"We've been speaking to the doctors and they think it is either stress or a heart attack,\" Russell Woolmer, his son, told South African radio from Cape Town. \"There was a lot of stress in his job and it may have been stress that caused it. We're all very shocked and we don't know what to do.\"The news of Woolmer's death was announced by Pervez Mir, Pakistan's media manager, a couple of hours after it first became known that he had been taken ill. \"Bob Woolmer has passed away. I am speaking from the hospital and all the team management is also at the hospital. Doctors have pronounced him dead.

Woolmer, a diabetic, was found unconscious on his hotel-room floor at around 10.45am after team officials grew concerned that they had not seen him since the previous evening. Mir said he had blood on him and there was vomit on the walls.Karl Angell, director of communication for the Jamaica Constabulary Force, said Woolmer was pronounced dead by doctors at the University Hospital of the West Indies in Kingston, where he had been rushed to, at 12.14pm on Sunday.Woolmer's death comes less than 24 hours after Pakistan were knocked out of the World Cup following their defeat by Ireland. After the match, Woolmer spoke of the pressures of coaching. \"Doing it internationally, it takes a toll on you,\" he said. \"The endless travelling and the non-stop living out of hotels.\"I am deeply hurt and cannot tell you how it is going to affect me,\" Woolmer told AFP late on Saturday after the Ireland defeat, saying he would answer more questions on email later in the week.Mir said Pakistan would still play their final World Cup group match on Wednesday. \"The Pakistan team will continue its participation in the tournament.

Woolmer is not a first for me, I have been doing autopsies here [in Jamaica] since 1995.\"June 12 The Jamaica Constabulary Force (JCF) end weeks of speculation by confirming that Bob Woolmer died of natural causes on March 18 and was not murdered. South African and Canadian pathologists had concurred with a finding by a British forensics expert that \"Mr Woolmer died of natural causes,\" Lucius Thomas, the police commissioner, says. In further toxicology tests, \"no substance was found to indicate that Bob Woolmer was poisoned\".The Pakistan board expresses relief at the news. Nasim Ashraf, chairman of the board, tells Cricinfo that it is now time to move on and that there are unlikely to be any legal ramifications from this.Paul Condon, the head of the ICC's corruption-busting force, says said that people who linked Woolmer's death to match-fixing should now \"shut up.\"June 4 Pressure is growing on the pathologist whose post mortem led Jamaican police to launch a murder investigation to resign. And Mark Shields, the deputy commissioner of police, has slightly distanced himself from his findings. \"Usually we investigate a murder and we look for suspects but on this occasion, because of the lack of evidence to support the pathologist what we've done is gone out to prove it's not a murder,\" he told The Times. \"We have to go with what the pathologist gives, and if I'd ignored it and it had turned out to be true I would have been lambasted for not treating it seriously.\"June 3 Jamaican police decline to comment as it is widely reported they are set to make an embarrassing climbdown and admit that Woolmer died of natural causes. It is revealed that his family were told last month that there was uncertainty over how he died.June 2 According to reports in Daily Mail, Scotland Yard detectives have told Jamaican police that Woolmer was not murdered but died of natural causes. Police are expected to announce the findings later this week.May 23 The BBC dismisses a claim by Ehsan Qureshi, a Pakistani journalist, that its Panorama programme implied he was connected with the death of Woolmer.

The Jamaica Gleaner carries a report which claims that there is evidence that Woolmer was not murdered. May 10 According to Pervez Mir, Pakistan's media manager during the World Cup, the two champagne bottles found in Woolmer's room were passed on to him by Mushtaq Ahmed, Pakistan's assistant coach, who had left them in his hotel room May 9 Jamaican police insist that they have credible evidence to suggest Woolmer was murdered as against reports of Pakistani investigators stating otherwise. May 8 A Pakistani investigator point to lack of evidence suggesting that Woolmer was murdered. May 7 A report in London's Sunday Times claims that there is evidence Woolmer was poisoned using weedkiller. May 5 The team of Pakistani investigators have finished their report on Woolmer's murder, the results of which are due to be presented today. May 4 Woolmer is cremated in a private ceremony, attended by his family, near to his home in Cape Town. April 30 A BBC TV investigation claims toxicology reports prove Woolmer was drugged. It also reveals that there were deep religious divides within the squad. April 29 Woolmer's body arrives in Cape Town. April 26 Police rule out suggestions that snake venom was used on Woolmer, while Mark Shields hits out at \"wild\" rumours which he says are \"causing a lot of distress\" to the family. Woolmer's body leaves Jamaica en route to South Africa. April 23 Jamaican government officials give permission for Woolmer's body to be released and taken back to his family in South Africa. Mark Shields, the deputy commissioner of police, and the Kingston coroner Patrick Murphy agree to the move, according to a statement from the ministry of national security. April 22 A report in the Mail on Sunday quotes the Woolmer family as saying they have been told that police believe he was poisoned using a natural substance and that body tissue tests, which are the only way to establish that, are being undertaken in England. April 21 Pakistan Cricket Board officials deny receiving a request from police in Jamaica to send any Pakistani player there in connection with investigations. Indian TV had reported that players, including Inzamam-ul-Haq and Mushtaq Ahmed, had been summoned to Kingston. April 20 \"New and significant developments\" in the investigation delay the inquest that was due to start on Monday. A statement from the Jamaican justice ministry says the hearing will be postponed following advice from the coroner. \"The coroner wishes that these new and significant developments be pursued with the utmost urgency.\" April 19 Ireland's players end their World Cup adventure by giving statements, fingerprints and DNA samples to Jamaican police. \"These tests were carried out with a view to eliminating the Ireland squad from their enquiries,\" a team spokesman says. On the night Woolmer was murdered none of the Ireland squad was in the Pegasus Hotel in Jamaica. The players were celebrating St Patrick's Day and the victory over Pakistan in Ocho Rios, which is \"some 50 miles away\". April 17 Speculation that Woolmer was poisoned is resurrected by local newspapers in the Caribbean claiming to quote the toxicology report which states that samples taken from his blood, stomach and urine have shown the presence of a foreign substance. An unnamed government source says that this substance could have been poison. April 16 It is reported that police officers from Jamaica will visit Pakistan to quiz players over \"inconsistencies\" in statements. April 15 A report in the UK Sunday Times quotes police sources as saying that Woolmer was poisoned before being strangled. Mark Shields announces he will fly to South Africa to meet with Woolmer's family. April 12 Jamaican police announce that CCTV footage from the Pegasus Hotel has been sent to Scotland Yard in London for further analysis. April 12 Jamaican police announce that CCTV footage from the Pegasus Hotel has been sent to Scotland Yard in London for further analysis. April 11 It is reported in Kingston that the coroner's inquest into Woolmer's death will start on April 23. Sources say that Patrick Murphy, the coroner for Kingston, will hold a full hearing, complete with live testimony from as many as a dozen witnesses who were in the process of being summoned to appear. April 9 Inzamam-ul-Haq said the World Cup would have been stopped if Woolmer's death had happened in any other country. The replacements for Woolmer and Inzamam as coach and captain will be discussed on Tuesday when the Pakistan Cricket Board's ad-hoc committee meets in Lahore. Inzamam told a parliamentary committee the World Cup defeats were part of cricket and he was \"hurt\" by match-fixing allegations. April 8 It wasn't a day for good news, with Mark Shields, the chief investigator, saying it may take another eight weeks to get the results of Woolmer's toxicology tests. The reports are crucial to proving whether Woolmer was poisoned or drugged and the delay means a quick end to the investigation is unlikely. \"It's in everyone's interest to know exactly when he died and how,\" Shields said. \"But frustrating as it may be, science goes at a certain pace.\" Apparently Woolmer's last meal was lasagne. April 7 Gill Woolmer has given permission for the publication of his book which will be published in September. April 6 Gill Woolmer says her husband did not mention match-fixing or being scared in his final emails. Mrs Woolmer, who did not want him to take the coaching position with Pakistan, thought the police were doing a \"good job\" but she wanted a \"speedy conclusion\" to the investigation. Woolmer was keeping a World Cup diary and planning to write a book about his time with Pakistan, but Mrs Woolmer said \"it is best if that book never appears now\". \"If it is going to cause upset, it is not worth publishing.\" April 5 No major developments in the case have emerged a day after the memorial service for Woolmer in Cape Town. Ian Chappell writes that Woolmer's murder ended any chance of his brother Greg continuing his role as India's coach. \"Such an ugly incident is sure to focus your concentration on life's priorities. Greg is probably better off without all the angst that comes with one of the most demanding jobs in cricket.\" April 4 Allan Donald says Woolmer \"lived for the game and succumbed to the game\" during a memorial service for his former coach in Cape Town. Donald also read a statement from Woolmer's widow Gill and her two sons while Tim Noakes, who co-authored a book with Woolmer, described him as a \"cricket missionary\". The Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Nasim Ashraf attended the service at the Wynberg high school and said: \"We in Pakistan loved Bob.\" Woolmer's body is still in Jamaica and there are reports it has been embalmed, which could make a second post-mortem difficult. April 3 Four Scotland Yard detectives were due in Jamaica on Tuesday and they should be joined by a high-profile Pakistani policeman in a growing list of assistants. Mir Zubair Mahmood, who successfully led the investigation into the murder of the US reporter Daniel Pearl, is due to travel to Jamaica with another Pakistan security official on Wednesday. \"It's a big, big responsibility on our shoulders and I hope we will be able to live up to the expectations,\" Zubair said. Interpol's Dr Susan Hitchen, a forensic expert in DNA analysis, has also arrived in Kingston to help the local police. April 2 Mark Shields, the chief investigator, says there is a possibility a poison was used to incapacitate Woolmer before his death. \"I have said from the beginning that if he was manually strangled, there are certain aspects that don't quite add up,\" Shields told AFP. Shields did not comment directly on a report that aconite had been used to kill Woolmer and said it was pointless speculating before the toxicology reports returned. In The Age there are concerns Jamaican bureaucracy will hold up the inquiry into Woolmer's death. Meanwhile Nasim Ashraf, the chairman of the Pakistan board, has confirmed that the Pakistani policeman who led the probe into the murder of US reporter Daniel Pearl will travel to Jamaica to help police investigating the death of cricket coach Woolmer Inzamam-ul-Haq lays a wreath during a memorial service for Woolmer in Lahore © AFP April 1 A memorial service is held for Woolmer in Lahore and Inzamam-ul-Haq was there with six of his team-mates. Four hundred mourners attended and they hear Woolmer was like a \"second father\" to the squad. \"After Woolmer's family, the Pakistan team was the most aggrieved by his death,\" Inzamam says during the hour-long service. The Jamaica Gleaner says a blood-stained pillow was found in Woolmer's room, but Mark Shields, the chief investigator, does not confirm the report. Media speculation intensifies with reports in some papers claiming he was poisoned with the herb aconite. March 31 More official cavalry is arriving in Jamaica with a team from Scotland Yard due to land in the next week after a request for help from the local police. Three detectives and a scenes of crime officer will make the trip to review the investigation into Woolmer's death. There will be even more foreign assistance in trying to track down the killers after Nasim Ashraf, the PCB chairman, says two Pakistan police officers will also travel to Kingston. Ashraf, who says no players were involved in the crime, will attend Woolmer's memorial service in South Africa on Wednesday. He also says the next coach will be a Pakistani and announces the players' contracts would be suspended. March 30 Pakistan has offered to send a three-person team to Jamaica to help with the investigation, following reports of dissatisfaction within Pakistan over how the case is proceeding. If approved by the Jamaican authorities, the group would likely include one PCB official, one diplomat and one senior investigative officer. A report in the Daily Telegraph also indicates the Jamaica police have requested a group of Scotland Yard detectives fly to Kingston to review the inquiry. Plans for a memorial service in Cape Town next Wednesday were also announced, with speakers to include Allan Donald. March 29 The time of Woolmer's death is still in doubt, but Mark Shields, the chief investigator, is certain he was murdered. He confirms again that Woolmer died due to manual strangulation, possibly with a towel. CCTV has revealed all the people who were on the 12th floor of the Pegasus Hotel, but police have to wait for an exact time of death before Shields can \"tie down when we should be looking at the tape\". Dr Ere Seshaiah, the pathologist who carried out the autopsy, is confident of his findings, despite questions arising about the manner of the death. In Pakistan a report from Reuters says the team was ordered to play the final group game against Zimbabwe or they would have been handed severe fines. March 28 Jamaica police dismiss speculation that there will be a second autopsy on Woolmer's body in a bid to quash media speculation that he might have died after hitting his head on the bathroom sink rather than have been murdered; that follows comments from an unnamed Pakistan board official who said: \"We believe that the autopsy by the pathologist may have had error counts and [the police] are now considering having a second autopsy to confirm the cause of death\". March 27 Jamaican police are reported to be searching for three mystery fans who they want to question; they also say that an examination of Woolmer's laptop shows no evidence of anything to do with match-fixing; Mark Shields, the deputy police commissioner, explains that the meal Woolmer had in his room is also being examined. \"We are looking at whether his food was drugged, the meal was thrown away after he put the tray outside his room, but we are conducting toxicology and tissue tests.\" Pakistan are officially eliminated from the police investigation into the murder. March 26 Pakistan start their long journey home, but not before police had again questioned three members of the group. A Pakistan official complains that the team have been kept in the dark over the investigation. March 25 As investigations continue, reports that the murder was related to match-fixing continue, Lord MacLaurin, the former head of the England board, launches a stinging attack on the way the ICC is run. Shaharyar M Khan - A gentle man, a superb coach News - Inzamam controlled the team, not Woolmer March 24 The police order an inquest. It emerges that Woolmer was preparing to write a book on his time as Pakistan coach, in addition to one he had just completed on coaching in general.

News - Bob's loss hurts more than elimination - Inzamam March 23 Speculation abounds, with match-fixing groups widely rumoured to be involved in the murder. There are calls for the \"World Cup to be cancelled, while others suggest the tournament is played in Woolmer's honour.

He went on to make 149, the highest score in a World Cup final © Getty Images In 30 previous World Cup innings, Adam Gilchrist had never reached the three-figure mark - his highest had been 99, against the Sri Lankans in 2003. It seemed the run-out on that occasion would deny him the landmark forever, but in what will almost certainly be his final World Cup innings, Gilchrist conjured up his best display. By the time he was done, he had made the fifth century - and the highest score - in a World Cup final, and had put Australia firmly on the road to a hat-trick of World Cup triumphs.There was plenty of discussion over Ricky Ponting's decision to bat first after winning the toss in conditions which were likely to favour the fast bowlers, but Gilchrist made all that talk redundant with an astonishing display of attacking batsmanship. On a true pitch, Gilchrist needed precisely six balls to gauge the pace and bounce, before hitting Vaas for two fours and a six in a six-ball period which set the trend. In his first 24 deliveries he scored at a run a ball, before really turning it on. Once he got into his stride, none of the Sri Lankan bowlers had much clue about how to stop him.

Usually very strong square of the wicket on the off side, he scored 65 of his 149 runs in the V between mid-off and mid-on. In contrast, he scored just 13 in the arc from cover to third man.On a pitch on which the ball was coming on to the bat, Gilchrist's front-foot drives were particularly lethal and fetched him 63 runs, including six fours and five sixes. And when Muttiah Muralitharan came into the attack, Gilchrist employed the sweep to counter the fact that he couldn't read the spin out of the hand.

Lasith Malinga hadn't played against the Australians in the Super Eights, and that move probably saved the Sri Lankans about 20 runs, as the Australian openers gave themselves some time to figure him out. His first four overs went for six; his next four leaked 43. The Sri Lankans allowed only 46 in the first ten overs, and 118 in the last 16, but they lost the game in the 12 overs in between, as Gilchrist and Matthew Hayden blasted 117 at nearly ten per over. That was also the period when Gilchrist took the majority of the strike, and in the mood he was in, it was simply impossible to stop him. Break-up of Gilchrist and Hayden's 172-run partnership Period Gilchrist - Balls Runs Hayden - Balls Runs First 10 overs (46 runs) 30 31 31 14 Next 12.5 overs (126 runs) 53 88 25 24 More stats With this win, Australia extended their unbeaten run in World Cup matches to 29, and their winning streak to 23. The last time they were beaten was on May 23, 1999, when they lost to Pakistan by ten runs. (Click here for their list of World Cup results.) This was Gilchrist's third successive fifty-plus score in a World Cup final. He had scored 54 against Pakistan at Lord's in 1999 and 57 against India at Johannesburg in 2003. This was the 100th time that Gilchrist and Hayden were opening in ODIs, and they made it a special occasion by putting together 172, their best in ODIs, improving upon the 170 they added against South Africa at Durban in 2002. This was their 16th century stand for the first wicket, which equals the record held by Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly. Tendulkar and Ganguly, though, opened in 117 innings. The stand was the highest for the first wicket in a World Cup final, obliterating the 129 that Mike Brearley and Geoff Boycott added in 1979. Gilchrist and Hayden had also posted 105 for the opening wicket in the 2003 final against India, which is the only other century stand in a World Cup decider. It is also the second-highest partnership for all wickets in a World Cup final, after the 234-run stand between Ricky Ponting and Damien Martyn in the 2003 edition. Gilchrist is the fifth batsman to score a hundred in a World Cup final, after Clive Lloyd (102 in 1975), Viv Richards (138 in 1979), Aravinda de Silva (107 in 1996) and Ponting (140 in 2003). He is the fourth wicketkeeper - after Dave Houghton, Andy Flower and Rahul Dravid - to score a century in World Cups. Gilchrist completed 9000 ODI runs and 1000 World Cup runs during the course of his 149. Gilchrist slammed eight sixes in his knock, which equals the World Cup record for most sixes in a single innings, which is jointly held by Ponting and Imran Nazir. Gilchrist also had a good game with the gloves, and when he snaffled Upul Tharanga, he became the first wicketkeeper to get to 50 dismissals behind the stumps. This was the second-highest opening partnership against Sri Lanka in World Cups. The highest was by an Australian pair too - Rick McCosker and Alan Turner added 182 at The Oval in 1975. These are also Australia's two best first-wicket stands in World Cups. Sri Lanka didn't have much to celebrate, but there was one important personal milestone for Sanath Jayasuriya - when he reached 58, he became only the second batsman, after Sachin Tendulkar, to get to 12,000 ODI runs. Jayasuriya now has 12,005 runs from 390 ODIs, at an average of 33.25. With Kumar Sangakkara scoring 54 as well, this was a pretty good match for wicketkeepers. It was the first time in the World Cup that two keepers scored a hundred and a half-century in the same game. Glenn McGrath finished with just one wicket, but that was enough to lift his tally in the tournament to 26, the highest by any bowler in a single World Cup. Chaminda Vaas had a forgettable game, conceding 54 from eight overs, during the course of which he became the sixth bowler to concede more than 1000 runs in World Cups. He joins Wasim Akram, Javagal Srinath, Muralitharan, Jayasuriya and McGrath. Ponting's run-out was the 13th instance of a captain being dismissed in such a manner in this tournament. It's a record for a single World Cup, beating the previous record of seven in 1992.Matthew HaydenAdam GilchristGlenn McGrathAustraliaSri LankaAustralia vs Sri LankaICC World Cup Matches (11) Matches (11) (11) SL v PAK (1) SL v PAK (1) (1) SA-W in ENG (1) SA-W in ENG (1) (1) County DIV1 (5) County DIV1 (5) (5) County DIV2 (3) County DIV2 (3) (3) TNPL (1) TNPL (1) (1) Live • 2nd TEST • Galle • 2nd TEST (15.1 ov) & Day 3 - Session 2: Sri Lanka lead by 206 runs.

The last time they were beaten was on May 23, 1999, when they lost to Pakistan by ten runs. (Click here for their list of World Cup results.) This was Gilchrist's third successive fifty-plus score in a World Cup final. He had scored 54 against Pakistan at Lord's in 1999 and 57 against India at Johannesburg in 2003. This was the 100th time that Gilchrist and Hayden were opening in ODIs, and they made it a special occasion by putting together 172, their best in ODIs, improving upon the 170 they added against South Africa at Durban in 2002. This was their 16th century stand for the first wicket, which equals the record held by Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly. Tendulkar and Ganguly, though, opened in 117 innings. The stand was the highest for the first wicket in a World Cup final, obliterating the 129 that Mike Brearley and Geoff Boycott added in 1979. Gilchrist and Hayden had also posted 105 for the opening wicket in the 2003 final against India, which is the only other century stand in a World Cup decider. It is also the second-highest partnership for all wickets in a World Cup final, after the 234-run stand between Ricky Ponting and Damien Martyn in the 2003 edition. Gilchrist is the fifth batsman to score a hundred in a World Cup final, after Clive Lloyd (102 in 1975), Viv Richards (138 in 1979), Aravinda de Silva (107 in 1996) and Ponting (140 in 2003). He is the fourth wicketkeeper - after Dave Houghton, Andy Flower and Rahul Dravid - to score a century in World Cups. Gilchrist completed 9000 ODI runs and 1000 World Cup runs during the course of his 149. Gilchrist slammed eight sixes in his knock, which equals the World Cup record for most sixes in a single innings, which is jointly held by Ponting and Imran Nazir. Gilchrist also had a good game with the gloves, and when he snaffled Upul Tharanga, he became the first wicketkeeper to get to 50 dismissals behind the stumps. This was the second-highest opening partnership against Sri Lanka in World Cups. The highest was by an Australian pair too - Rick McCosker and Alan Turner added 182 at The Oval in 1975. These are also Australia's two best first-wicket stands in World Cups. Sri Lanka didn't have much to celebrate, but there was one important personal milestone for Sanath Jayasuriya - when he reached 58, he became only the second batsman, after Sachin Tendulkar, to get to 12,000 ODI runs. Jayasuriya now has 12,005 runs from 390 ODIs, at an average of 33.25. With Kumar Sangakkara scoring 54 as well, this was a pretty good match for wicketkeepers. It was the first time in the World Cup that two keepers scored a hundred and a half-century in the same game. Glenn McGrath finished with just one wicket, but that was enough to lift his tally in the tournament to 26, the highest by any bowler in a single World Cup. Chaminda Vaas had a forgettable game, conceding 54 from eight overs, during the course of which he became the sixth bowler to concede more than 1000 runs in World Cups. He joins Wasim Akram, Javagal Srinath, Muralitharan, Jayasuriya and McGrath. Ponting's run-out was the 13th instance of a captain being dismissed in such a manner in this tournament. It's a record for a single World Cup, beating the previous record of seven in 1992.

He went on to make 149, the highest score in a World Cup final © Getty Images In 30 previous World Cup innings, Adam Gilchrist had never reached the three-figure mark - his highest had been 99, against the Sri Lankans in 2003. It seemed the run-out on that occasion would deny him the landmark forever, but in what will almost certainly be his final World Cup innings, Gilchrist conjured up his best display. By the time he was done, he had made the fifth century - and the highest score - in a World Cup final, and had put Australia firmly on the road to a hat-trick of World Cup triumphs. There was plenty of discussion over Ricky Ponting's decision to bat first after winning the toss in conditions which were likely to favour the fast bowlers, but Gilchrist made all that talk redundant with an astonishing display of attacking batsmanship. On a true pitch, Gilchrist needed precisely six balls to gauge the pace and bounce, before hitting Vaas for two fours and a six in a six-ball period which set the trend. In his first 24 deliveries he scored at a run a ball, before really turning it on. Once he got into his stride, none of the Sri Lankan bowlers had much clue about how to stop him.

Usually very strong square of the wicket on the off side, he scored 65 of his 149 runs in the V between mid-off and mid-on. In contrast, he scored just 13 in the arc from cover to third man. On a pitch on which the ball was coming on to the bat, Gilchrist's front-foot drives were particularly lethal and fetched him 63 runs, including six fours and five sixes. And when Muttiah Muralitharan came into the attack, Gilchrist employed the sweep to counter the fact that he couldn't read the spin out of the hand.

Lasith Malinga hadn't played against the Australians in the Super Eights, and that move probably saved the Sri Lankans about 20 runs, as the Australian openers gave themselves some time to figure him out. His first four overs went for six; his next four leaked 43. The Sri Lankans allowed only 46 in the first ten overs, and 118 in the last 16, but they lost the game in the 12 overs in between, as Gilchrist and Matthew Hayden blasted 117 at nearly ten per over.

In 2007, teams were split into four groups of four each but the experiment backfired when India and Pakistan bowed out in the first round, considerably robbing the tournament of commercial and spectator interest. The latest format, though, gave the teams more chances of recovering from a poor start. Teams were split into two groups of seven each, every team playing the other in the group once. The top four from each group would qualify for the quarter-finals.Initially, the four subcontinent teams were due to host the tournament, but the terror attack on the Sri Lanka team bus in Lahore in 2009, and the deteriorating security situation, led to Pakistan being dropped as a co-host. The matches were then shared between India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.Innovations It was the first World Cup to use the DRS, and Super Over for deciding tied matches (though not for the group matches).Group stages The tournament began with a series of one-sided games, with the minnows Kenya and Canada getting thrashed. Netherlands gave England a scare by posting 292 but failed to defend it. Pakistan, too, overcame a scare against Canada in a low-scoring game. Bangalore hosted two thrillers: the match between India and England ended in a tie and England lost to Ireland in another close match. Ireland looked all but out of the contest at 111 for 5, chasing a massive 328, but Kevin O'Brien played the innings of his life - 113 - to give his side one of their best wins. Bangladesh were rolled over for 58 by West Indies, leading to unruly behaviour from their fans, but the team regained pride when they beat England in a nail-biter in the following game. Australia's 34-game winning streak in World Cup matches ended when they lost to Pakistan.ESPNcricinfo's coverage of the 2011 World CupSummary of resultsComplete averages1st semi-final: Sri Lanka v New Zealand2nd semi-final: India v PakistanFinal: India v Sri LankaThe quarter-finals Unlike in 2007, when the second round featured two unlikely entrants in Bangladesh and Ireland, none of the lower-ranked teams made it through in this edition. Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Australia and New Zealand qualified from Group A while South Africa, India, England and West Indies made it from the other group. India knocked out defending champions Australia - in search of their fourth consecutive title while Pakistan thrashed West Indies by ten wickets after bundling them out for 112. South Africa were comfortably placed to beat New Zealand but choked - not for the first time in an ICC tournament - and their batting collapsed to Jacob Oram in a vitriolic quarter-final; Sri Lanka hammered England by ten wickets in front of home fans in Colombo.The semis In the first semi-final in Colombo, Sri Lanka restricted New Zealand to 217 and overcame jitters towards the end to win by five wickets. In the second semi-final, the organisers got what they had hoped for - an India-Pakistan clash in a knockout. Sachin Tendulkar was dropped as many as five times on his way to 85 and India posted a competitive 260 in Mohali, with Wahab Riaz taking a five-wicket haul. The chase was tantalising but Pakistan failed to soak up the pressure as the game wore on and lost regular wickets. Misbah-ul-Haq, caught in two minds whether to attack or play safe, was left with too much to do in the end, as Pakistan succumbed to their fifth consecutive defeat against India in World Cup matches.The final India were in their third World Cup final and their first at home. Sri Lanka made it to their second consecutive final but the partisan crowd was always going to test them. Mahela Jayawardene overcame that pressure to score a poetic century, guiding Sri Lanka to 274 and leaving India to pull off the highest chase in a World Cup final. There was a hush when India lost Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag early, but Gautam Gambhir and Virat Kohli revived hopes with a stand of 83. Then came the captain's masterstroke. MS Dhoni chose to promote himself ahead of the in-form Yuvraj Singh, with India needing 160 from 28 overs. Gambhir fell for 97 but India still had the upper hand with Dhoni steadying the nerves at the other end. Yuvraj Singh joined Dhoni and the pair snatched all hope for the visitors with a flurry of boundaries. Dhoni's winning six over long-on, followed by a stylish bat twirl that rested under his arm pit, became the tournament's snapshot as India won the World Cup after 28 years. Yuvraj, who fought off illness through the World Cup, picked up the Man of the Tournament award.Last hurrah Muttiah Muralitharan, who had quit Tests a year earlier, bowed out of international cricket after the final. Pakistan's Shoaib Akhtar announced midway through the tournament that he was quitting international cricket.Not to be forgotten Compared to the 2007 World Cup, the tournament was a resounding success, thanks largely to the fact that India, the powerhouse of world cricket, triumphed at home. The ICC got the format right, though it was probably their good fortune that India and Pakistan didn't get eliminated in the quarter-finals. There was a controversy, though, barely days after the final. In a bid to make the tournament even more competitive, the ICC had decided to limit the 2015 and 2019 editions to just the ten Test nations. However, following a wave of protests from the Associates, the ICC later decided to revert to the 14-team format for the 2015 edition, giving the Associates a chance to play in the tournament via a qualifier. Ireland's inspiring win against England fuelled the debate that it was unfair to cull the Associates and that a ten-team World Cup would not give the tournament a 'global' feel. The 2011 edition would also be remembered for Dhoni's swagger in the wining moment.ICC Cricket World CupKanishkaa Balachandran is a senior sub-editor at ESPNcricinfo Matches (11) Matches (11) (11) SL v PAK (1) SL v PAK (1) (1) SA-W in ENG (1) SA-W in ENG (1) (1) County DIV1 (5) County DIV1 (5) (5) County DIV2 (3) County DIV2 (3) (3) TNPL (1) TNPL (1) (1) Live • 2nd TEST • Galle • 2nd TEST (15.1 ov) & Day 3 - Session 2: Sri Lanka lead by 206 runs.

In 2007, teams were split into four groups of four each but the experiment backfired when India and Pakistan bowed out in the first round, considerably robbing the tournament of commercial and spectator interest. The latest format, though, gave the teams more chances of recovering from a poor start. Teams were split into two groups of seven each, every team playing the other in the group once. The top four from each group would qualify for the quarter-finals. Initially, the four subcontinent teams were due to host the tournament, but the terror attack on the Sri Lanka team bus in Lahore in 2009, and the deteriorating security situation, led to Pakistan being dropped as a co-host. The matches were then shared between India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. Innovations It was the first World Cup to use the DRS, and Super Over for deciding tied matches (though not for the group matches). Group stages The tournament began with a series of one-sided games, with the minnows Kenya and Canada getting thrashed. Netherlands gave England a scare by posting 292 but failed to defend it. Pakistan, too, overcame a scare against Canada in a low-scoring game. Bangalore hosted two thrillers: the match between India and England ended in a tie and England lost to Ireland in another close match. Ireland looked all but out of the contest at 111 for 5, chasing a massive 328, but Kevin O'Brien played the innings of his life - 113 - to give his side one of their best wins. Bangladesh were rolled over for 58 by West Indies, leading to unruly behaviour from their fans, but the team regained pride when they beat England in a nail-biter in the following game. Australia's 34-game winning streak in World Cup matches ended when they lost to Pakistan. The quarter-finals Unlike in 2007, when the second round featured two unlikely entrants in Bangladesh and Ireland, none of the lower-ranked teams made it through in this edition. Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Australia and New Zealand qualified from Group A while South Africa, India, England and West Indies made it from the other group. India knocked out defending champions Australia - in search of their fourth consecutive title while Pakistan thrashed West Indies by ten wickets after bundling them out for 112. South Africa were comfortably placed to beat New Zealand but choked - not for the first time in an ICC tournament - and their batting collapsed to Jacob Oram in a vitriolic quarter-final; Sri Lanka hammered England by ten wickets in front of home fans in Colombo. The semis In the first semi-final in Colombo, Sri Lanka restricted New Zealand to 217 and overcame jitters towards the end to win by five wickets. In the second semi-final, the organisers got what they had hoped for - an India-Pakistan clash in a knockout. Sachin Tendulkar was dropped as many as five times on his way to 85 and India posted a competitive 260 in Mohali, with Wahab Riaz taking a five-wicket haul. The chase was tantalising but Pakistan failed to soak up the pressure as the game wore on and lost regular wickets. Misbah-ul-Haq, caught in two minds whether to attack or play safe, was left with too much to do in the end, as Pakistan succumbed to their fifth consecutive defeat against India in World Cup matches. The final India were in their third World Cup final and their first at home. Sri Lanka made it to their second consecutive final but the partisan crowd was always going to test them. Mahela Jayawardene overcame that pressure to score a poetic century, guiding Sri Lanka to 274 and leaving India to pull off the highest chase in a World Cup final. There was a hush when India lost Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag early, but Gautam Gambhir and Virat Kohli revived hopes with a stand of 83. Then came the captain's masterstroke. MS Dhoni chose to promote himself ahead of the in-form Yuvraj Singh, with India needing 160 from 28 overs. Gambhir fell for 97 but India still had the upper hand with Dhoni steadying the nerves at the other end. Yuvraj Singh joined Dhoni and the pair snatched all hope for the visitors with a flurry of boundaries. Dhoni's winning six over long-on, followed by a stylish bat twirl that rested under his arm pit, became the tournament's snapshot as India won the World Cup after 28 years. Yuvraj, who fought off illness through the World Cup, picked up the Man of the Tournament award. Last hurrah Muttiah Muralitharan, who had quit Tests a year earlier, bowed out of international cricket after the final. Pakistan's Shoaib Akhtar announced midway through the tournament that he was quitting international cricket. Not to be forgotten Compared to the 2007 World Cup, the tournament was a resounding success, thanks largely to the fact that India, the powerhouse of world cricket, triumphed at home. The ICC got the format right, though it was probably their good fortune that India and Pakistan didn't get eliminated in the quarter-finals. There was a controversy, though, barely days after the final. In a bid to make the tournament even more competitive, the ICC had decided to limit the 2015 and 2019 editions to just the ten Test nations. However, following a wave of protests from the Associates, the ICC later decided to revert to the 14-team format for the 2015 edition, giving the Associates a chance to play in the tournament via a qualifier. Ireland's inspiring win against England fuelled the debate that it was unfair to cull the Associates and that a ten-team World Cup would not give the tournament a 'global' feel. The 2011 edition would also be remembered for Dhoni's swagger in the wining moment.

Mixx Mixx", " Last updated on 29 March 201529 March 2015.From the section Cricket Australia overwhelmed New Zealand to win the World Cup for a fifth time at an ecstatic Melbourne Cricket Ground. New Zealand lost influential captain Brendon McCullum to the fifth ball of the match and were bowled out for 183. Grant Elliott resisted with 83, while Mitchell Starc, Mitchell Johnson and James Faulkner shared eight wickets. Australia rarely looked troubled, sealing a seven-wicket win in 33.1 overs, with captain Michael Clarke scoring 74 and Steve Smith 56 not out. Clarke, in his final one-day international, was given a standing ovation by the record 93,000 crowd and welcomed by his team-mates on the boundary when he was bowled by Matt Henry with eight required. He was part of the Australia team that last lifted the trophy in 2007, with this success extending their record for most World Cups won. No other team has more than two. Australia's win was the second in as many tournaments by a host nation after India's triumph four years ago. It provided a joyous end to an emotional Australian summer which saw batsman Phillip Hughes die after being struck on the neck by a ball in Sydney in November. In their first final, after six previous semi-final defeats, New Zealand were blown away. Their path to Melbourne came with eight successive wins, all on home soil, and most of the pre-match speculation was of how McCullum's men would deal with the change in conditions. They won what was thought to be a crucial toss, but the life was sucked from their innings almost as soon as it began. The talismanic McCullum, so often a slayer of new-ball attacks throughout the tournament, aimed two wild swings at Starc, missed with both, then was bowled by a brilliant yorker. Far from the batting paradise predicted, the pitch was slightly two-paced and offered both turn and some uneven bounce. But that is to take nothing away from the Australia pace attack, Starc in particular, who bowled with hostility and found movement both in the air and off the seam. New Zealand clung on without progressing, but when Glenn Maxwell's off-spin got through a lazy Martin Guptill stroke and Kane Williamson patted back to Johnson, they seemed in disarray. However, from 39-3, they painstakingly rebuilt through semi-final hero Elliott and Ross Taylor. Elliott, who successfully overturned a Maxwell lbw decision on 15, scored almost exclusively through the off-side to become only the fifth man to register a half-century in the semi-final and final of the same World Cup. Taylor made 40 in a stand of 111 provided a platform for the batting powerplay. Yet it was the powerplay that began New Zealand's slide, as Faulkner returned to have Taylor athletically caught behind by Brad Haddin and bowl Corey Anderson two balls later. When Luke Ronchi played an awful waft to be caught at slip off Starc, three wickets had been lost for one run in eight balls. There was no support for Elliott, who was caught behind attempting to heave Faulkner and, when Maxwell superbly ran out non-striker Tim Southee with a direct hit for the final wicket, it was the perfect demonstration of Australia's dominance. In all, New Zealand lost seven wickets for 33 runs. Though Aaron Finch inside-edged on to his pad to be caught and bowled by Trent Boult, David Warner's brisk 45 gave Australia's chase early momentum. After he was caught hooking Henry, there began a period of pressure that Clarke and Smith battled to absorb, the latter needing the fortune of seeing the bails stay unmoved as a Henry delivery trickled on to the base of the stumps. It would be New Zealand's last chance, as Clarke's cuts and drives down the ground accelerated Australia towards victory. He could not see the job through, but Smith became the first man to score five successive World Cup half-centuries then pulled Henry for the winning runs.

The game will continue where it was halted - New Zealand will complete their 50-over innings and India will then complete their 50-over innings, weather permitting. The match may be shortened dependent on conditions. For the match to be completed, India are required to bat for at least 20 overs. If after the reserve day the match has still not reached a result, India will progress to the final given their higher finishing position in the group stage. 22:44 IST 22:38 IST 22:35 IST -- Umpires and officials are having a chat with captains. 22:21 IST -- BAD NEWS! It's raining again. The covers are back. 22:20 IST -- UPDATE: The cut-off time for a 20-over chase is 11:05 pm IST, and India's target would be 148 22:00 IST -- UPDATE: GOOD NEWS! 21:30 IST -- UPDATE: Rain has gotten heavier. Match unlikely to restart today. 21:20 IST -- UPDATE: 21:10 IST -- UPDATE: 21:00 IST -- We have officially started losing overs if there is a resumption today. We will lose one over for every four minutes. 20:50 IST -- UPDATE: WHAT IF Scenarios: 19:50 IST -- UPDATE: The cut-off time tonight is two hours after normal end of play, that's 00:30 IST As we wait for rain to stop, let's re-examine the reserve-day rules: The reserve day will only come into operation if the minimum 20 overs-per-side match needed for a result under the Duckworth-Lewis method for rain-affected games cannot be finished today. In that case, the match would continue Wednesday from where it left off rather than be re-started. But if a 20 overs per side match cannot be completed on Wednesday as well, India would go through to Sunday's final at Lord's on the basis of having finished first to New Zealand's fourth in the 10-team group stage. 19:35 IST -- UPDATE: 19:00 IST RAIN UPDATE: It has gotten heavier in Manchester.

Teams have lined-up for the national anthems Amazing atmosphere at the Old Trafford CAPTAINS' TAKE: Virat Kohli | India captain: We would've batted first. Fresh wicket, nice and hard, and not moist. A bit of rain around as well, the ball will get wet as the game goes on. It could remain decent throughout the game. It's going to remain similar throughout the course of the game - we have done well in Manchester. We have had two good games in Manchester, and it's about focussing on the basics. We need to remember why we are in the semis. Chahal comes back in for Kuldeep Yadav. Kane Williamson | New Zealand captain: We're going to have a bat. It looks like a good surface. We have played a number of games here. A toss-up with the overheads, but it'll be around all day, so we need to get the job first up. We are used to the routine, but we have a great opportunity to put up a good performance against a side like India. Ferguson comes in for Southee. PLAYING XIs: New Zealand: India: TEAM NEWS: TOSS: New Zealand captain Kane Williamson wins toss, opts to bat against India at Old Trafford Pitch Report, courtesy VVS Laxman: Even though it's overcast, the wicket looks dry. It's a fresh wicket, and it's definitely a bat-first wicket. It's a semi-final, there will be a lot of scoreboard pressure. Perhaps India might try Jadeja for batting depth. Jadhav has got Williamson and Taylor out before, so he might pip Karthik into the Playing XI.

Two teams without a World Cup title between them in 44 years of the men's competition. After 100 overs, the last couple of which contained almost as much drama as a few previous finals in their entirety, nothing could separate England and New Zealand. For the first time in World Cup history, a Super Over was required to determine the winner.Asked to score 16 from six balls, Jimmy Neesham coolly struck Jofra Archer's second legitimate delivery way back into the Mound Stand, making the equation seven off four. A brace of twos followed, before Archer's bumper took Neesham off strike. Martin Guptill, at the end of a tournament of personal trial, needing to hit two more otherwise England would take the trophy on boundaries scored. Archer found a yorker, Guptill found deep midwicket and Jason Roy's throw found Guptill short; Jos Buttler completed the run-out at full stretch to end all those years of hurt and an afternoon of exquisite agony.What the playing conditions say- In the event of a Super Over tie, the team that hit more boundaries (combined from the main match and the Super Over) shall be the winner- If the number of boundaries hit by both teams is equal, the team whose batsmen scored more boundaries during its innings in the main match (ignoring the Super Over) shall be the winner- If still equal, a count-back from the final ball of the Super Over will be conducted. The team with the higher scoring delivery shall be the winner. If a team loses two wickets during its over, then any unbowled deliveries will be counted as dot ballsEngland had only got close in their chase thanks to Buttler and Ben Stokes, whose 110-run stand lifted the home nation from peril at 86 for 4. The pair walked out again to scramble 15 from an over of Trent Boult: pressure back on New Zealand. They responded by sending out Neesham, a man who not so long ago was contemplating quitting the game, to face Archer, in his 14th ODI. Only one could finish a hero.That said, there were heroes aplenty on both sides. For the second game in succession, New Zealand put up a score in the region of 240 and defended it with every fibre of their Blackcapped beings. Just when they appeared to have the game won, a man born in Christchurch ripped it from their hands, in a manner at once extraordinary and unbelievable. Stokes finished unbeaten on 84, though like Guptil he too could not manage a two from the final ball of England's innings to win the game in regulation time.New Zealand had gone into the final over believing that the trophy was in their grasp. England needed 15, Stokes carrying a country's hopes - not to mention the almost unbearable weight of history - on his shoulders. The first two balls bowled by Boult were dots, before Stokes mowed the third for six into the crowd at midwicket. Then came an intervention that was either cruel or miraculous, depending on your perspective. Stokes, diving for his ground as he attempted to complete a second run, diverted Guptill's throw off his bat - inadvertantly - past wicketkeeper Tom Latham and away to the rope for four more.Jos Buttler runs out Martin Guptill to crown England champions•Getty ImagesStokes immediately held up his hands in apology, but with no sign that he had changed the course of his run to intercept the throw, it went down as a second consecutive six. That left England needing three from two, though Boult kept his cool to twice run out the non-striker coming back for a second and send the game into a Super Over.The previous over, something almost as extraordinary had occurred: having caught Stokes on the boundary at wide long-on, Boult stepped on the rope before he could relay the ball back in to Guptill. Instead of Stokes departing for 63, with England needing 22 off eight and Nos. 9 and 10 at the crease, he was granted another shot at redemption. Instead of Kolkata Part II, this was to become his finest hour, Stokes ultimately crowned man of the match after leading England to victory in a World Cup final at the fourth time of asking.Watch on Hotstar (India only): Highlights of the heart-stopping World Cup finalThere is a new name on the cup, then, but they didn't half keep the engravers waiting. England had built towards this competition for four years, planned for it, yearned for it - and when the moment came, the outburst was rapturous. Staid and stuffy Lord's had become a cauldron of emotion long before that last passage of play.New Zealand deserved better than to end up the fall guys again. Their captain, Kane Williamson, orchestrated his men in the field to squeeze England's chase until it became unbearable. First Buttler fell with 46 required from the last 31 balls, Lockie Ferguson delivering what seemed to be the killer blow. Stokes staggered on, even as the tail became expendable. Ultimately, the fact England had scored 24 boundaries in their innings, compared to New Zealand's 16, was the decisive factor.Watch on Hotstar (USA only): Highlights of the epic World Cup 2019 finalThat one of England's fours was effectively an overthrow may always rankle, as well as a couple of the umpiring decisions that went the other way. Williamson, who made only 30 but captained with nerves of steel and was named man of the tournament, called the runs via Stokes' deflection \"a shame\" but suggested that for New Zealand, beaten finalists for the second World Cup running, it was just not meant to be.The very first delivery of England's chase gave an indication of how nerve-shredding a contest this would become. Boult produced a curving inswinger to hit Jason Roy squarely on the front pad and 4.8m primarily rugby-loving people went up in unison. Marais Erasmus shook his head and although New Zealand chose to review, it was Roy who benefited from the marginal nature of umpire's call.Eoin Morgan holds the World Cup aloft•Getty ImagesThe opening exchanges were a blur of black and blue, with bruises on both sides, when Matt Henry finally located Roy's outside edge. England's opening partnership has been totemic and Roy had swaggered into this final, so the importance of his dismissal was twofold in that it both dented English confidence and deprived the chase of a man who might quickly reduce the odds in their favour.With Henry bowling a beautiful spell and Joe Root unable to find his rhythm, New Zealand clawed their way into the ascendency. The tension was enervating, Lord's subdued. Colin de Grandhomme dropped Bairstow off his own bowling, a reaction chance to his midriff, as New Zealand strung together three maidens in a row. Root then cracked: hit on the pads and then beaten when he gave de Grandhomme the charge, he next threw his bat at a wide outswinger to be caught behind.In stultifying conditions, New Zealand applied a choke hold. Bairstow dragged on against the pace of Ferguson, who then brilliantly caught Eoin Morgan running in from deep point. Meanwhile de Grandhomme, playing the role of a latter-day Madan Lal, bowled ten overs off the reel.Nothing about this contest was straightforward, including the decision at the toss, which had been delayed by 15 minutes due to early morning rain. Williamson chose to bat, in keeping with the dominant trend at this tournament - runs on the board matter. While England bowled well enough, a Powerplay score of 33 for 1 left the teams circling each other warily; New Zealand happy to have only lost Guptill, England eager to send back Williamson, too, as quickly as possible.With Henry Nicholls providing the first half-century by a New Zealand opener since the opening game, they were able to establish a foothold. As in the group match between these two, Nicholls was given out lbw on zero by a Chris Woakes delivery that was going over the stumps; this time, on the biggest stage, he had the wherewithal to use New Zealand's review.England thought they might have removed Guptill inside the first couple of overs, too, only for Erasmus to correctly adjudge that the ball from Archer had flicked the batsman's trousers rather than outside edge. Guptill's response was to try and hit a way out of his rut, ramping Archer for six and smashing another boundary back down the ground. But Woakes brought one back inside an expansive drive to hit the back leg, and Guptill's wasted review was to have consequences later on.Nicholls and Williamson played sensibly to put on 74 but, whether it was the pitch or the occasion, the innings nevertheless began to enter a gentle tailspin from the moment Williamson was removed by Liam Plunkett - DRS again required to overturn the on-field call.

Two teams without a World Cup title between them in 44 years of the men's competition. After 100 overs, the last couple of which contained almost as much drama as a few previous finals in their entirety, nothing could separate England and New Zealand. For the first time in World Cup history, a Super Over was required to determine the winner. Asked to score 16 from six balls, Jimmy Neesham coolly struck Jofra Archer's second legitimate delivery way back into the Mound Stand, making the equation seven off four. A brace of twos followed, before Archer's bumper took Neesham off strike. Martin Guptill, at the end of a tournament of personal trial, needing to hit two more otherwise England would take the trophy on boundaries scored. Archer found a yorker, Guptill found deep midwicket and Jason Roy's throw found Guptill short; Jos Buttler completed the run-out at full stretch to end all those years of hurt and an afternoon of exquisite agony. England had only got close in their chase thanks to Buttler and Ben Stokes, whose 110-run stand lifted the home nation from peril at 86 for 4. The pair walked out again to scramble 15 from an over of Trent Boult: pressure back on New Zealand. They responded by sending out Neesham, a man who not so long ago was contemplating quitting the game, to face Archer, in his 14th ODI. Only one could finish a hero. That said, there were heroes aplenty on both sides. For the second game in succession, New Zealand put up a score in the region of 240 and defended it with every fibre of their Blackcapped beings. Just when they appeared to have the game won, a man born in Christchurch ripped it from their hands, in a manner at once extraordinary and unbelievable. Stokes finished unbeaten on 84, though like Guptil he too could not manage a two from the final ball of England's innings to win the game in regulation time. New Zealand had gone into the final over believing that the trophy was in their grasp. England needed 15, Stokes carrying a country's hopes - not to mention the almost unbearable weight of history - on his shoulders. The first two balls bowled by Boult were dots, before Stokes mowed the third for six into the crowd at midwicket. Then came an intervention that was either cruel or miraculous, depending on your perspective. Stokes, diving for his ground as he attempted to complete a second run, diverted Guptill's throw off his bat - inadvertantly - past wicketkeeper Tom Latham and away to the rope for four more.

That left England needing three from two, though Boult kept his cool to twice run out the non-striker coming back for a second and send the game into a Super Over. The previous over, something almost as extraordinary had occurred: having caught Stokes on the boundary at wide long-on, Boult stepped on the rope before he could relay the ball back in to Guptill. Instead of Stokes departing for 63, with England needing 22 off eight and Nos. 9 and 10 at the crease, he was granted another shot at redemption. Instead of Kolkata Part II, this was to become his finest hour, Stokes ultimately crowned man of the match after leading England to victory in a World Cup final at the fourth time of asking. Watch on Hotstar (India only): Highlights of the heart-stopping World Cup final There is a new name on the cup, then, but they didn't half keep the engravers waiting. England had built towards this competition for four years, planned for it, yearned for it - and when the moment came, the outburst was rapturous. Staid and stuffy Lord's had become a cauldron of emotion long before that last passage of play. New Zealand deserved better than to end up the fall guys again. Their captain, Kane Williamson, orchestrated his men in the field to squeeze England's chase until it became unbearable. First Buttler fell with 46 required from the last 31 balls, Lockie Ferguson delivering what seemed to be the killer blow. Stokes staggered on, even as the tail became expendable. Ultimately, the fact England had scored 24 boundaries in their innings, compared to New Zealand's 16, was the decisive factor. Watch on Hotstar (USA only): Highlights of the epic World Cup 2019 final That one of England's fours was effectively an overthrow may always rankle, as well as a couple of the umpiring decisions that went the other way. Williamson, who made only 30 but captained with nerves of steel and was named man of the tournament, called the runs via Stokes' deflection \"a shame\" but suggested that for New Zealand, beaten finalists for the second World Cup running, it was just not meant to be. The very first delivery of England's chase gave an indication of how nerve-shredding a contest this would become. Boult produced a curving inswinger to hit Jason Roy squarely on the front pad and 4.8m primarily rugby-loving people went up in unison. Marais Erasmus shook his head and although New Zealand chose to review, it was Roy who benefited from the marginal nature of umpire's call. Eoin Morgan holds the World Cup aloft Eoin Morgan holds the World Cup aloft Eoin Morgan holds the World Cup aloft • • Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images The opening exchanges were a blur of black and blue, with bruises on both sides, when Matt Henry finally located Roy's outside edge. England's opening partnership has been totemic and Roy had swaggered into this final, so the importance of his dismissal was twofold in that it both dented English confidence and deprived the chase of a man who might quickly reduce the odds in their favour. With Henry bowling a beautiful spell and Joe Root unable to find his rhythm, New Zealand clawed their way into the ascendency. The tension was enervating, Lord's subdued. Colin de Grandhomme dropped Bairstow off his own bowling, a reaction chance to his midriff, as New Zealand strung together three maidens in a row. Root then cracked: hit on the pads and then beaten when he gave de Grandhomme the charge, he next threw his bat at a wide outswinger to be caught behind. In stultifying conditions, New Zealand applied a choke hold. Bairstow dragged on against the pace of Ferguson, who then brilliantly caught Eoin Morgan running in from deep point. Meanwhile de Grandhomme, playing the role of a latter-day Madan Lal, bowled ten overs off the reel. Nothing about this contest was straightforward, including the decision at the toss, which had been delayed by 15 minutes due to early morning rain. Williamson chose to bat, in keeping with the dominant trend at this tournament - runs on the board matter. While England bowled well enough, a Powerplay score of 33 for 1 left the teams circling each other warily; New Zealand happy to have only lost Guptill, England eager to send back Williamson, too, as quickly as possible. With Henry Nicholls providing the first half-century by a New Zealand opener since the opening game, they were able to establish a foothold. As in the group match between these two, Nicholls was given out lbw on zero by a Chris Woakes delivery that was going over the stumps; this time, on the biggest stage, he had the wherewithal to use New Zealand's review. England thought they might have removed Guptill inside the first couple of overs, too, only for Erasmus to correctly adjudge that the ball from Archer had flicked the batsman's trousers rather than outside edge. Guptill's response was to try and hit a way out of his rut, ramping Archer for six and smashing another boundary back down the ground. But Woakes brought one back inside an expansive drive to hit the back leg, and Guptill's wasted review was to have consequences later on. Nicholls and Williamson played sensibly to put on 74 but, whether it was the pitch or the occasion, the innings nevertheless began to enter a gentle tailspin from the moment Williamson was removed by Liam Plunkett - DRS again required to overturn the on-field call. Nicholls chopped on against another Plunkett cross-seamer four overs later, and then New Zealand were left to curse their luck when Ross Taylor was given out lbw, despite ball-tracking showing the ball going over the top of leg stump. It would not end up being the only talking point of the day.

When you love sport, you understand how it can take you to places little else can. You could watch it all your life and never quite fathom what happened between 6.30 and 7.30pm in two sun-kissed rectangles of grass seven or so miles apart across England's capital city. A World Cup final that might just be the greatest game of cricket in history, a Wimbledon men's final longer than any that has come before. Because this was summer's sporting day of days, they stepped hand in hand. You couldn't watch and you couldn't look away. You hated it and you loved it and you lost yourself completely to it. No-one had ever seen Lord's like this, a beautiful sedate museum turned into a cavorting mess. No-one had really seen cricket like this. There is a line often brought out when sport does these sorts of things - you couldn't write this - and a hoary riposte: haven't you seen Star Wars, or read Harry Potter? On a day when sometimes nothing appeared to make sense, both these contradictory positions became true. You couldn't write it, because it was a plotline too twisted to make dramatic sense, too confusing, too remote from what has gone before. We're OK with spaceships and child wizards because they have been imagined before. Plenty had dreamed of England winning the World Cup. That's where logic waved farewell. A match that ended in a tie to produce a tie-breaker that also ended in a tie. A final over that contained a six that was a six and also contained a six that wasn't a six at all but actually a two and a four, which meant the final over wasn't the final over any more either. When you try to navigate your way through those 60 hallucinogenic minutes you keep coming up against these impossible riddles: New Zealand's Martin Guptill facing the first ball of the match and the last one too; a tournament that England's men had never won before won with a winning margin that wasn't even a winning margin. Seven weeks of cricket and it came down to the final dusty half-metre at the spiritual home of the sport. A final that for so long was slow-motion cricket ending at a pace that took the breath from your lungs and the strength from your legs. Cricket that was a throwback to 20 years ago suddenly leaping into the unknown. It was unprecedented and it was also a very English way to win a World Cup. Extra time at Wembley in 1966, extra time in Sydney in 2003. A champagne super over in London, that strange comforting familiarity of feeling absolutely awful watching England do something you had always hoped they might. Eoin Morgan's men were supposed to be rompers in this tournament. They were the demolition men who took on big totals and danced across the finish line. You knew deep down it was never going to be easy. It never is with England. You just didn't know it was going to be this hard. There were scoring rates from the late 1990s and an innings perfectly pitched to that fragile, panicked era of England one-day batting, as if the cavalier swordsmen of the current team had been replaced by a cricketing historical re-enactment society. Romp? It was like a four-hour penalty shootout, at least until it became a shootout, at which point England's final over felt like a lifetime and then produced one more for each side that took another half-hour. Panic on the posh streets of London, panic in the living-rooms of the nation. As the contest swung one way then the other and then back again, Lord's was awash with pacers - men and women walking, hopping, striding purposely to nowhere at all. As Ben Stokes dragged England to the brink, into the abyss and then out again, a country had long forgotten that watching sport is supposed to be fun. All the while, horrible sums. 100 needed from 88. 80 from 66. 65 off 48, people standing up to cheer a wide. It was 44 from 26 as the final hour began. Men in crisp cotton shirts and chinos swigging pink champagne direct from the bottle. 39 off 24, 34 needed off the last three overs, 24 off two. The 50th over began at 6.55. 15 runs required. Two balls later, 15 needed from four, and then, in two balls and four minutes, came 12 impossible runs. At 7pm, England needed two to win. Mark Wood was run out by a mile, and so the final act began: a World Cup into its first ever super over at the same time as a Wimbledon final went into its first ever fifth-set tie-breaker. Both teams thought they had it won and lost in the tumult of the final 12 balls, just as both Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer could feel the Wimbledon trophy in their hands. At some distant forgotten point in the afternoon the hero was going to be Liam Plunkett until it was Colin de Grandhomme, at least until Jos Buttler took over, and then the super over began and it was suddenly Stokes until it was Buttler, except it was then Jimmy Neesham and then Jofra Archer and then Jason Roy and Buttler all over again. You realised as that final throw came in from Roy to his wicketkeeper to leave Guptill and New Zealand that tiny, vast distance short that you were lucky to have seen it and that cricket was lucky to have conjured it. Fourteen long years since the last live England game on free-to-air television, a day for the converted to testify, a chance for a whole new generation to feel the unique horrors and joys of watching England play cricket. You felt like putting an arm around the new devotees in the giddy aftermath. It's not always like this. But it can do exactly this to you. It was awful for New Zealand, fancied by no-one, so close to pulling off one of the great upsets with a brand of cricket that felt archaic until it made perfect sense. It was no sort of compensation for the brilliant Kane Williamson to be awarded man of the tournament. But it was wonderful for England, four years on from their humiliation in Adelaide at the last World Cup, and it was redemption for all those who have followed them and hoped and suffered along the way. So much happened in the golden hour that you struggle to hold on to discrete images. But there is one England supporters will never forget: 11 men in pale blue, chasing wild circles on the green Lord's outfield as the stumps lay splattered and Guptill knelt beside them, the ancient pavilion dancing, the shadows stretching, the World Cup - after 44 long years - finally won.

When you love sport, you understand how it can take you to places little else can. You could watch it all your life and never quite fathom what happened between 6.30 and 7.30pm in two sun-kissed rectangles of grass seven or so miles apart across England's capital city. A World Cup final that might just be the greatest game of cricket in history, a Wimbledon men's final longer than any that has come before. Because this was summer's sporting day of days, they stepped hand in hand. You couldn't watch and you couldn't look away. You hated it and you loved it and you lost yourself completely to it. No-one had ever seen Lord's like this, a beautiful sedate museum turned into a cavorting mess. No-one had really seen cricket like this. There is a line often brought out when sport does these sorts of things - you couldn't write this - and a hoary riposte: haven't you seen Star Wars, or read Harry Potter? On a day when sometimes nothing appeared to make sense, both these contradictory positions became true. You couldn't write it, because it was a plotline too twisted to make dramatic sense, too confusing, too remote from what has gone before. We're OK with spaceships and child wizards because they have been imagined before. Plenty had dreamed of England winning the World Cup. That's where logic waved farewell. Media playback is not supported on this device A match that ended in a tie to produce a tie-breaker that also ended in a tie. A final over that contained a six that was a six and also contained a six that wasn't a six at all but actually a two and a four, which meant the final over wasn't the final over any more either. When you try to navigate your way through those 60 hallucinogenic minutes you keep coming up against these impossible riddles: New Zealand's Martin Guptill facing the first ball of the match and the last one too; a tournament that England's men had never won before won with a winning margin that wasn't even a winning margin. Seven weeks of cricket and it came down to the final dusty half-metre at the spiritual home of the sport. A final that for so long was slow-motion cricket ending at a pace that took the breath from your lungs and the strength from your legs. Cricket that was a throwback to 20 years ago suddenly leaping into the unknown. It was unprecedented and it was also a very English way to win a World Cup. Media playback is not supported on this device Extra time at Wembley in 1966, extra time in Sydney in 2003. A champagne super over in London, that strange comforting familiarity of feeling absolutely awful watching England do something you had always hoped they might. Eoin Morgan's men were supposed to be rompers in this tournament. They were the demolition men who took on big totals and danced across the finish line. You knew deep down it was never going to be easy. It never is with England. You just didn't know it was going to be this hard. There were scoring rates from the late 1990s and an innings perfectly pitched to that fragile, panicked era of England one-day batting, as if the cavalier swordsmen of the current team had been replaced by a cricketing historical re-enactment society. Romp? It was like a four-hour penalty shootout, at least it became a shootout, at which point England's final over felt like a lifetime and then produced one more for each side that took another half-hour. Panic on the posh streets of London, panic in the living-rooms of the nation. As the contest swung one way then the other and then back again, Lord's was awash with pacers - men and women walking, hopping, striding purposely to nowhere at all. As Ben Stokes dragged England to the brink, into the abyss and then out again, a country had long forgotten that watching sport is supposed to be fun. All the while, horrible sums. 100 needed from 88. 80 from 66. 65 off 48, people standing up to cheer a wide. It was 44 from 26 as the final hour began. Men in crisp cotton shirts and chinos swigging pink champagne direct from the bottle. 39 off 24, 34 needed off the last three overs, 24 off two. The 50th over began at 6.25. 15 runs required. Two balls later, 15 needed from four, and then, in two balls and four minutes, came 12 impossible runs. Media playback is not supported on this device At 7pm, England needed two to win. Mark Wood was run out by a mile, and so the final act began: a World Cup into its first ever super over at the same time as a Wimbledon final went into its first ever fifth-set tie-breaker. Both teams thought they had it won and lost in the tumult of the final 12 balls, just as both Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer could feel the Wimbledon trophy in their hands. At some distant forgotten point in the afternoon the hero was going to be Liam Plunkett until it was Colin de Grandhomme, at least until Jos Buttler took over, and then the super over began and it was suddenly Stokes until it was Buttler, except it was then Jimmy Neesham and then Jofra Archer and then Jason Roy and Buttler all over again. You realised as that final throw came in from Roy to his wicketkeeper to leave Guptill and New Zealand that tiny, vast distance short that you were lucky to have seen it and that cricket was lucky to have conjured it. Fourteen long years since the last live England game on free-to-air television, a day for the converted to testify, a chance for a whole new generation to feel the unique horrors and joys of watching England play cricket. You felt like putting an arm around the new devotees in the giddy aftermath. It's not always like this. But it can do exactly this to you. It was awful for New Zealand, fancied by no-one, so close to pulling off one of the great upsets with a brand of cricket that felt archaic until it made perfect sense. It was no sort of compensation for the brilliant Kane Williamson to be awarded man of the tournament. But it was wonderful for England, four years on from their humiliation in Adelaide at the last World Cup, and it was redemption for all those who have followed them and hoped and suffered along the way. So much happened in the golden hour that you struggle to hold on to discrete images. But there is one England supporters will never forget: 11 men in pale blue, chasing wild circles on the green Lord's outfield as the stumps lay splattered and Guptill knelt beside them, the ancient pavilion dancing, the shadows stretching, the World Cup - after 44 long years - finally won.

Captain Ricky Ponting hit a blistering 140 as the Aussies scored a massive 359 for two - their highest-ever one-day total. Despite a fighting 82 from Virender Sehwag, India could only make 234. And in securing their third World Cup triumph, Australia also became the only side to win all of their matches in a World Cup tournament. Captain Sourav Ganguly's decision to bowl first when he won the toss backfired spectacularly. Ponting and Damien Martyn shared a partnership of 234 to take Australia well past the previous highest score in a final - the West Indies' 291 (off 60 overs) in 1975. World Cup final; Over-by-over Martyn's 88, from 84 balls, was completely overshadowed by Ponting, as was the opening stand of 105 between Adam Gilchrist and Matthew Hayden. There was some evidence of the early dampness in the pitch that was behind Ganguly's surprise decision, but his nervous pace attack failed to use it.

Zaheer, deposited into the second tier of the stand at the Golf Course End by Ponting off the penultimate ball of the innings, finished with none for 67 from seven overs. Gilchrist dominated the early overs, hitting 57 off 48 balls before over-reaching on a slog-sweep at spinner Harbhajan Singh. Harbhajan also dismissed Hayden, caught behind for 37 edging at a ball that came across his body. But he was only brought back into the attack in time to see Ponting complete his half-century in the 39th over. India didn't give their fans much to shout about View from our man at the final And Ponting then hit the accelerator, smacking consecutive sixes off the spinner on the way to completing his second 50 in just 29 balls. India tried bravely to keep pace with a required run rate of 7.2 per over from the off. But man of the tournament Sachin Tendulkar lasted just four balls before lofting Glenn McGrath a return catch. The innings could have been cut down shortly afterwards had Brett Lee not over-stepped when he had Sehwag, on four at the time, caught at square leg. But Sehwag made the most of his let-off. After Ganguly mistimed Lee to mid-on for 24, Sehwag and Rahul Dravid added 88 for the fourth wicket in 13 overs, either side of a 25-minute break for rain. But the stand was brought to an abrupt halt when Lehmann's sharp throw from mid-off beat Sehwag as he scurried to add to his 82, which included 10 fours and three sixes.

Zaheer, deposited into the second tier of the stand at the Golf Course End by Ponting off the penultimate ball of the innings, finished with none for 67 from seven overs. Gilchrist dominated the early overs, hitting 57 off 48 balls before over-reaching on a slog-sweep at spinner Harbhajan Singh. Harbhajan also dismissed Hayden, caught behind for 37 edging at a ball that came across his body. But he was only brought back into the attack in time to see Ponting complete his half-century in the 39th over. India didn't give their fans much to shout about View from our man at the final And Ponting then hit the accelerator, smacking consecutive sixes off the spinner on the way to completing his second 50 in just 29 balls. India tried bravely to keep pace with a required run rate of 7.2 per over from the off. But man of the tournament Sachin Tendulkar lasted just four balls before lofting Glenn McGrath a return catch. The innings could have been cut down shortly afterwards had Brett Lee not over-stepped when he had Sehwag, on four at the time, caught at square leg. But Sehwag made the most of his let-off. After Ganguly mistimed Lee to mid-on for 24, Sehwag and Rahul Dravid added 88 for the fourth wicket in 13 overs, either side of a 25-minute break for rain. But the stand was brought to an abrupt halt when Lehmann's sharp throw from mid-off beat Sehwag as he scurried to add to his 82, which included 10 fours and three sixes. HAVE YOUR SAY Australia totally crushed India.

First was Dravid for 47, playing on to Bichel in an attempt to drive through the off-side. Having been dropped three times, Yuvraj Singh followed for 24, taken at midwicket off Hogg. And Martyn's spectacular diving catch to dismiss Dinesh Mongia effectively finished the contest in the 36th over, the first of two wickets for medium-pacer Andrew Symonds.

And in securing their third World Cup triumph, Australia also became the only side to win all of their matches in a World Cup tournament. Captain Sourav Ganguly's decision to bowl first when he won the toss backfired spectacularly. Ponting and Damien Martyn shared a partnership of 234 to take Australia well past the previous highest score in a final - the West Indies' 291 (off 60 overs) in 1975.

First was Dravid for 47, playing on to Bichel in an attempt to drive through the off-side. Having been dropped three times, Yuvraj Singh followed for 24, taken at midwicket off Hogg. And Martyn's spectacular diving catch to dismiss Dinesh Mongia effectively finished the contest in the 36th over, the first of two wickets for medium-pacer Andrew Symonds. Australia: Ricky Ponting (captain), Adam Gilchrist, Matthew Hayden, Damien Martyn, Darren Lehmann, Michael Bevan, Andrew Symonds, Andy Bichel, Brad Hogg, Brett Lee, Glenn McGrath. India: Sourav Ganguly (captain), Virender Sehwag, Sachin Tendulkar, Dinesh Mongia, Rahul Dravid, Mohammad Kaif, Yuvraj Singh, Harbhajan Singh, Javagal Srinath, Zaheer Khan, Ashish Nehra. Umpires: David Shepherd, England, and Steve Bucknor, West Indies. Zaheer, deposited into the second tier of the stand at the Golf Course End by Ponting off the penultimate ball of the innings, finished with none for 67 from seven overs. Gilchrist dominated the early overs, hitting 57 off 48 balls before over-reaching on a slog-sweep at spinner Harbhajan Singh. Harbhajan also dismissed Hayden, caught behind for 37 edging at a ball that came across his body. But he was only brought back into the attack in time to see Ponting complete his half-century in the 39th over. India didn't give their fans much to shout about View from our man at the final And Ponting then hit the accelerator, smacking consecutive sixes off the spinner on the way to completing his second 50 in just 29 balls. India tried bravely to keep pace with a required run rate of 7.2 per over from the off. But man of the tournament Sachin Tendulkar lasted just four balls before lofting Glenn McGrath a return catch. The innings could have been cut down shortly afterwards had Brett Lee not over-stepped when he had Sehwag, on four at the time, caught at square leg. But Sehwag made the most of his let-off. After Ganguly mistimed Lee to mid-on for 24, Sehwag and Rahul Dravid added 88 for the fourth wicket in 13 overs, either side of a 25-minute break for rain. But the stand was brought to an abrupt halt when Lehmann's sharp throw from mid-off beat Sehwag as he scurried to add to his 82, which included 10 fours and three sixes.

Bob has passed away and it is very shocking news to all of the team and the team management. \"Bob's family and wife were informed by the management about his condition when he was brought to hospital\", Mir said, adding that Woolmer's wife was on her way from South Africa. Mir's statement added that there would be a coroner's inquest and, in keeping with Jamaican law, an autopsy to determine the cause of death. Woolmer, a diabetic, was found unconscious on his hotel-room floor at around 10.45am after team officials grew concerned that they had not seen him since the previous evening. Mir said he had blood on him and there was vomit on the walls. Karl Angell, director of communication for the Jamaica Constabulary Force, said Woolmer was pronounced dead by doctors at the University Hospital of the West Indies in Kingston, where he had been rushed to, at 12.14pm on Sunday. Woolmer's death comes less than 24 hours after Pakistan were knocked out of the World Cup following their defeat by Ireland. After the match, Woolmer spoke of the pressures of coaching. \"Doing it internationally, it takes a toll on you,\" he said. \"The endless travelling and the non-stop living out of hotels. \"I am deeply hurt and cannot tell you how it is going to affect me,\" Woolmer told AFP late on Saturday after the Ireland defeat, saying he would answer more questions on email later in the week. Mir said Pakistan would still play their final World Cup group match on Wednesday. \"The Pakistan team will continue its participation in the tournament. We are due to play Zimbabwe and we will play that match,\" Mir told AFP by telephone from Jamaica. \"Obviously the boys are extremely sad, they are very distrurbed, they are shocked, but the boys have to play the match and they will.\" © ESPN EMEA Ltd.

Mrs Woolmer, who did not want him to take the coaching position with Pakistan, thought the police were doing a \"good job\" but she wanted a \"speedy conclusion\" to the investigation. Woolmer was keeping a World Cup diary and planning to write a book about his time with Pakistan, but Mrs Woolmer said \"it is best if that book never appears now\". \"If it is going to cause upset, it is not worth publishing.\" April 5 No major developments in the case have emerged a day after the memorial service for Woolmer in Cape Town. Ian Chappell writes that Woolmer's murder ended any chance of his brother Greg continuing his role as India's coach. \"Such an ugly incident is sure to focus your concentration on life's priorities. Greg is probably better off without all the angst that comes with one of the most demanding jobs in cricket.\" April 4 Allan Donald says Woolmer \"lived for the game and succumbed to the game\" during a memorial service for his former coach in Cape Town. Donald also read a statement from Woolmer's widow Gill and her two sons while Tim Noakes, who co-authored a book with Woolmer, described him as a \"cricket missionary\". The Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Nasim Ashraf attended the service at the Wynberg high school and said: \"We in Pakistan loved Bob.\" Woolmer's body is still in Jamaica and there are reports it has been embalmed, which could make a second post-mortem difficult. April 3 Four Scotland Yard detectives were due in Jamaica on Tuesday and they should be joined by a high-profile Pakistani policeman in a growing list of assistants. Mir Zubair Mahmood, who successfully led the investigation into the murder of the US reporter Daniel Pearl, is due to travel to Jamaica with another Pakistan security official on Wednesday. \"It's a big, big responsibility on our shoulders and I hope we will be able to live up to the expectations,\" Zubair said. Interpol's Dr Susan Hitchen, a forensic expert in DNA analysis, has also arrived in Kingston to help the local police. April 2 Mark Shields, the chief investigator, says there is a possibility a poison was used to incapacitate Woolmer before his death. \"I have said from the beginning that if he was manually strangled, there are certain aspects that don't quite add up,\" Shields told AFP. Shields did not comment directly on a report that aconite had been used to kill Woolmer and said it was pointless speculating before the toxicology reports returned. In The Age there are concerns Jamaican bureaucracy will hold up the inquiry into Woolmer's death. Meanwhile Nasim Ashraf, the chairman of the Pakistan board, has confirmed that the Pakistani policeman who led the probe into the murder of US reporter Daniel Pearl will travel to Jamaica to help police investigating the death of cricket coach Woolmer Inzamam-ul-Haq lays a wreath during a memorial service for Woolmer in Lahore © AFP April 1 A memorial service is held for Woolmer in Lahore and Inzamam-ul-Haq was there with six of his team-mates. Four hundred mourners attended and they hear Woolmer was like a \"second father\" to the squad. \"After Woolmer's family, the Pakistan team was the most aggrieved by his death,\" Inzamam says during the hour-long service. The Jamaica Gleaner says a blood-stained pillow was found in Woolmer's room, but Mark Shields, the chief investigator, does not confirm the report. Media speculation intensifies with reports in some papers claiming he was poisoned with the herb aconite. March 31 More official cavalry is arriving in Jamaica with a team from Scotland Yard due to land in the next week after a request for help from the local police. Three detectives and a scenes of crime officer will make the trip to review the investigation into Woolmer's death. There will be even more foreign assistance in trying to track down the killers after Nasim Ashraf, the PCB chairman, says two Pakistan police officers will also travel to Kingston. Ashraf, who says no players were involved in the crime, will attend Woolmer's memorial service in South Africa on Wednesday. He also says the next coach will be a Pakistani and announces the players' contracts would be suspended. March 30 Pakistan has offered to send a three-person team to Jamaica to help with the investigation, following reports of dissatisfaction within Pakistan over how the case is proceeding. If approved by the Jamaican authorities, the group would likely include one PCB official, one diplomat and one senior investigative officer. A report in the Daily Telegraph also indicates the Jamaica police have requested a group of Scotland Yard detectives fly to Kingston to review the inquiry. Plans for a memorial service in Cape Town next Wednesday were also announced, with speakers to include Allan Donald. March 29 The time of Woolmer's death is still in doubt, but Mark Shields, the chief investigator, is certain he was murdered. He confirms again that Woolmer died due to manual strangulation, possibly with a towel. CCTV has revealed all the people who were on the 12th floor of the Pegasus Hotel, but police have to wait for an exact time of death before Shields can \"tie down when we should be looking at the tape\". Dr Ere Seshaiah, the pathologist who carried out the autopsy, is confident of his findings, despite questions arising about the manner of the death. In Pakistan a report from Reuters says the team was ordered to play the final group game against Zimbabwe or they would have been handed severe fines. March 28 Jamaica police dismiss speculation that there will be a second autopsy on Woolmer's body in a bid to quash media speculation that he might have died after hitting his head on the bathroom sink rather than have been murdered; that follows comments from an unnamed Pakistan board official who said: \"We believe that the autopsy by the pathologist may have had error counts and [the police] are now considering having a second autopsy to confirm the cause of death\". March 27 Jamaican police are reported to be searching for three mystery fans who they want to question; they also say that an examination of Woolmer's laptop shows no evidence of anything to do with match-fixing; Mark Shields, the deputy police commissioner, explains that the meal Woolmer had in his room is also being examined. \"We are looking at whether his food was drugged, the meal was thrown away after he put the tray outside his room, but we are conducting toxicology and tissue tests.\" Pakistan are officially eliminated from the police investigation into the murder. March 26 Pakistan start their long journey home, but not before police had again questioned three members of the group. A Pakistan official complains that the team have been kept in the dark over the investigation. March 25 As investigations continue, reports that the murder was related to match-fixing continue, Lord MacLaurin, the former head of the England board, launches a stinging attack on the way the ICC is run. Shaharyar M Khan - A gentle man, a superb coach News - Inzamam controlled the team, not Woolmer March 24 The police order an inquest. It emerges that Woolmer was preparing to write a book on his time as Pakistan coach, in addition to one he had just completed on coaching in general.

News - Bob's loss hurts more than elimination - Inzamam March 23 Speculation abounds, with match-fixing groups widely rumoured to be involved in the murder. There are calls for the \"World Cup to be cancelled, while others suggest the tournament is played in Woolmer's honour. The PCB reveal Woolmer had sent an email shortly before he died resigning as coach. The Pakistan side are questioned and undergo DNA testing as part of the routine enquiries. Officials deny the squad have been asked to stay on in Jamaica after their final game. Michael Vaughan, England's captain, admits he has a \"gut feeling\" that there is still corruption in the game. News - Woolmer had decided to retire News - Academy to be built in Woolmer's honour News - Musharraf honours Woolmer March 22 Police confirm that they have launched a murder investigation. \"The pathologist's report states that Mr Woolmer's death was due to asphyxiation as a result of manual strangulation,\" Karl Angell, a police spokesman, says. \"In these circumstances, the matter ... is now being treated by the Jamaica police as a case of murder.\" March 21 Shields reveals that Woolmer's death is now being treated as \"suspicious\" although he refuses to go further. Two Jamaican newspapers run headline stories claiming that a senior police source says Woolmer was murdered. News - Bob was more than a coach - Rhodes March 20 The first autopsy is inconclusive and the pathologist asks for more tests before the cause of death can be identified. The police refuse to be drawn on rumblings in the media that there is more to the death than meets the eye: \"Any sudden death is treated as suspicious till we can say otherwise,\" says Mark Shields, Jamaica's deputy police commissioner. March 18 News filters through that Woolmer has been found unconscious in his hotel room, within hours it is confirmed that he has died. Tributes pour in from across the world.

The Jamaica Gleaner carries a report which claims that there is evidence that Woolmer was not murdered. May 10 According to Pervez Mir, Pakistan's media manager during the World Cup, the two champagne bottles found in Woolmer's room were passed on to him by Mushtaq Ahmed, Pakistan's assistant coach, who had left them in his hotel room May 9 Jamaican police insist that they have credible evidence to suggest Woolmer was murdered as against reports of Pakistani investigators stating otherwise. May 8 A Pakistani investigator point to lack of evidence suggesting that Woolmer was murdered. May 7 A report in London's Sunday Times claims that there is evidence Woolmer was poisoned using weedkiller. May 5 The team of Pakistani investigators have finished their report on Woolmer's murder, the results of which are due to be presented today. May 4 Woolmer is cremated in a private ceremony, attended by his family, near to his home in Cape Town. April 30 A BBC TV investigation claims toxicology reports prove Woolmer was drugged. It also reveals that there were deep religious divides within the squad. April 29 Woolmer's body arrives in Cape Town. April 26 Police rule out suggestions that snake venom was used on Woolmer, while Mark Shields hits out at \"wild\" rumours which he says are \"causing a lot of distress\" to the family. Woolmer's body leaves Jamaica en route to South Africa. April 23 Jamaican government officials give permission for Woolmer's body to be released and taken back to his family in South Africa. Mark Shields, the deputy commissioner of police, and the Kingston coroner Patrick Murphy agree to the move, according to a statement from the ministry of national security. April 22 A report in the Mail on Sunday quotes the Woolmer family as saying they have been told that police believe he was poisoned using a natural substance and that body tissue tests, which are the only way to establish that, are being undertaken in England. April 21 Pakistan Cricket Board officials deny receiving a request from police in Jamaica to send any Pakistani player there in connection with investigations. Indian TV had reported that players, including Inzamam-ul-Haq and Mushtaq Ahmed, had been summoned to Kingston. April 20 \"New and significant developments\" in the investigation delay the inquest that was due to start on Monday. A statement from the Jamaican justice ministry says the hearing will be postponed following advice from the coroner. \"The coroner wishes that these new and significant developments be pursued with the utmost urgency.\" April 19 Ireland's players end their World Cup adventure by giving statements, fingerprints and DNA samples to Jamaican police. \"These tests were carried out with a view to eliminating the Ireland squad from their enquiries,\" a team spokesman says. On the night Woolmer was murdered none of the Ireland squad was in the Pegasus Hotel in Jamaica. The players were celebrating St Patrick's Day and the victory over Pakistan in Ocho Rios, which is \"some 50 miles away\". April 17 Speculation that Woolmer was poisoned is resurrected by local newspapers in the Caribbean claiming to quote the toxicology report which states that samples taken from his blood, stomach and urine have shown the presence of a foreign substance. An unnamed government source says that this substance could have been poison. April 16 It is reported that police officers from Jamaica will visit Pakistan to quiz players over \"inconsistencies\" in statements. April 15 A report in the UK Sunday Times quotes police sources as saying that Woolmer was poisoned before being strangled. Mark Shields announces he will fly to South Africa to meet with Woolmer's family. April 12 Jamaican police announce that CCTV footage from the Pegasus Hotel has been sent to Scotland Yard in London for further analysis. April 12 Jamaican police announce that CCTV footage from the Pegasus Hotel has been sent to Scotland Yard in London for further analysis. April 11 It is reported in Kingston that the coroner's inquest into Woolmer's death will start on April 23. Sources say that Patrick Murphy, the coroner for Kingston, will hold a full hearing, complete with live testimony from as many as a dozen witnesses who were in the process of being summoned to appear. April 9 Inzamam-ul-Haq said the World Cup would have been stopped if Woolmer's death had happened in any other country. The replacements for Woolmer and Inzamam as coach and captain will be discussed on Tuesday when the Pakistan Cricket Board's ad-hoc committee meets in Lahore. Inzamam told a parliamentary committee the World Cup defeats were part of cricket and he was \"hurt\" by match-fixing allegations. April 8 It wasn't a day for good news, with Mark Shields, the chief investigator, saying it may take another eight weeks to get the results of Woolmer's toxicology tests. The reports are crucial to proving whether Woolmer was poisoned or drugged and the delay means a quick end to the investigation is unlikely. \"It's in everyone's interest to know exactly when he died and how,\" Shields said. \"But frustrating as it may be, science goes at a certain pace.\" Apparently Woolmer's last meal was lasagne.

He went on to make 149, the highest score in a World Cup final © Getty Images In 30 previous World Cup innings, Adam Gilchrist had never reached the three-figure mark - his highest had been 99, against the Sri Lankans in 2003. It seemed the run-out on that occasion would deny him the landmark forever, but in what will almost certainly be his final World Cup innings, Gilchrist conjured up his best display. By the time he was done, he had made the fifth century - and the highest score - in a World Cup final, and had put Australia firmly on the road to a hat-trick of World Cup triumphs.There was plenty of discussion over Ricky Ponting's decision to bat first after winning the toss in conditions which were likely to favour the fast bowlers, but Gilchrist made all that talk redundant with an astonishing display of attacking batsmanship. On a true pitch, Gilchrist needed precisely six balls to gauge the pace and bounce, before hitting Vaas for two fours and a six in a six-ball period which set the trend. In his first 24 deliveries he scored at a run a ball, before really turning it on. Once he got into his stride, none of the Sri Lankan bowlers had much clue about how to stop him.

Usually very strong square of the wicket on the off side, he scored 65 of his 149 runs in the V between mid-off and mid-on. In contrast, he scored just 13 in the arc from cover to third man.On a pitch on which the ball was coming on to the bat, Gilchrist's front-foot drives were particularly lethal and fetched him 63 runs, including six fours and five sixes. And when Muttiah Muralitharan came into the attack, Gilchrist employed the sweep to counter the fact that he couldn't read the spin out of the hand.

Lasith Malinga hadn't played against the Australians in the Super Eights, and that move probably saved the Sri Lankans about 20 runs, as the Australian openers gave themselves some time to figure him out. His first four overs went for six; his next four leaked 43. The Sri Lankans allowed only 46 in the first ten overs, and 118 in the last 16, but they lost the game in the 12 overs in between, as Gilchrist and Matthew Hayden blasted 117 at nearly ten per over. That was also the period when Gilchrist took the majority of the strike, and in the mood he was in, it was simply impossible to stop him.

The last time they were beaten was on May 23, 1999, when they lost to Pakistan by ten runs. (Click here for their list of World Cup results.) This was Gilchrist's third successive fifty-plus score in a World Cup final. He had scored 54 against Pakistan at Lord's in 1999 and 57 against India at Johannesburg in 2003. This was the 100th time that Gilchrist and Hayden were opening in ODIs, and they made it a special occasion by putting together 172, their best in ODIs, improving upon the 170 they added against South Africa at Durban in 2002. This was their 16th century stand for the first wicket, which equals the record held by Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly. Tendulkar and Ganguly, though, opened in 117 innings. The stand was the highest for the first wicket in a World Cup final, obliterating the 129 that Mike Brearley and Geoff Boycott added in 1979. Gilchrist and Hayden had also posted 105 for the opening wicket in the 2003 final against India, which is the only other century stand in a World Cup decider. It is also the second-highest partnership for all wickets in a World Cup final, after the 234-run stand between Ricky Ponting and Damien Martyn in the 2003 edition. Gilchrist is the fifth batsman to score a hundred in a World Cup final, after Clive Lloyd (102 in 1975), Viv Richards (138 in 1979), Aravinda de Silva (107 in 1996) and Ponting (140 in 2003). He is the fourth wicketkeeper - after Dave Houghton, Andy Flower and Rahul Dravid - to score a century in World Cups. Gilchrist completed 9000 ODI runs and 1000 World Cup runs during the course of his 149. Gilchrist slammed eight sixes in his knock, which equals the World Cup record for most sixes in a single innings, which is jointly held by Ponting and Imran Nazir. Gilchrist also had a good game with the gloves, and when he snaffled Upul Tharanga, he became the first wicketkeeper to get to 50 dismissals behind the stumps. This was the second-highest opening partnership against Sri Lanka in World Cups. The highest was by an Australian pair too - Rick McCosker and Alan Turner added 182 at The Oval in 1975. These are also Australia's two best first-wicket stands in World Cups. Sri Lanka didn't have much to celebrate, but there was one important personal milestone for Sanath Jayasuriya - when he reached 58, he became only the second batsman, after Sachin Tendulkar, to get to 12,000 ODI runs. Jayasuriya now has 12,005 runs from 390 ODIs, at an average of 33.25. With Kumar Sangakkara scoring 54 as well, this was a pretty good match for wicketkeepers. It was the first time in the World Cup that two keepers scored a hundred and a half-century in the same game. Glenn McGrath finished with just one wicket, but that was enough to lift his tally in the tournament to 26, the highest by any bowler in a single World Cup. Chaminda Vaas had a forgettable game, conceding 54 from eight overs, during the course of which he became the sixth bowler to concede more than 1000 runs in World Cups.

He went on to make 149, the highest score in a World Cup final © Getty Images In 30 previous World Cup innings, Adam Gilchrist had never reached the three-figure mark - his highest had been 99, against the Sri Lankans in 2003. It seemed the run-out on that occasion would deny him the landmark forever, but in what will almost certainly be his final World Cup innings, Gilchrist conjured up his best display. By the time he was done, he had made the fifth century - and the highest score - in a World Cup final, and had put Australia firmly on the road to a hat-trick of World Cup triumphs. There was plenty of discussion over Ricky Ponting's decision to bat first after winning the toss in conditions which were likely to favour the fast bowlers, but Gilchrist made all that talk redundant with an astonishing display of attacking batsmanship. On a true pitch, Gilchrist needed precisely six balls to gauge the pace and bounce, before hitting Vaas for two fours and a six in a six-ball period which set the trend. In his first 24 deliveries he scored at a run a ball, before really turning it on. Once he got into his stride, none of the Sri Lankan bowlers had much clue about how to stop him. Break-up of Gilchrist's 104-ball 149 Runs Dot balls 4s/ 6s First 24 balls 24 13 2/ 1 Next 80 balls 125 30 11/ 6 Gilchrist versus the Sri Lankan bowlers Bowler Balls Runs 4s/ 6s Scoring rate Muttiah Muralitharan 23 23 0/ 1 100.00 Lasith Malinga 17 19 3/ 0 111.76 Chaminda Vaas 25 30 4/ 1 120.00 Dilhara Fernando 23 42 5/ 2 182.60 Tillakaratne Dilshan 7 15 0/ 2 214.28 Sanath Jayasuriya 9 20 1/ 2 222.22 It was a typical Gilchrist innings in terms of his scoring rate, but not in terms of the strokes he played or the areas in which he scored. Usually very strong square of the wicket on the off side, he scored 65 of his 149 runs in the V between mid-off and mid-on. In contrast, he scored just 13 in the arc from cover to third man. On a pitch on which the ball was coming on to the bat, Gilchrist's front-foot drives were particularly lethal and fetched him 63 runs, including six fours and five sixes. And when Muttiah Muralitharan came into the attack, Gilchrist employed the sweep to counter the fact that he couldn't read the spin out of the hand.

Lasith Malinga hadn't played against the Australians in the Super Eights, and that move probably saved the Sri Lankans about 20 runs, as the Australian openers gave themselves some time to figure him out. His first four overs went for six; his next four leaked 43. The Sri Lankans allowed only 46 in the first ten overs, and 118 in the last 16, but they lost the game in the 12 overs in between, as Gilchrist and Matthew Hayden blasted 117 at nearly ten per over. That was also the period when Gilchrist took the majority of the strike, and in the mood he was in, it was simply impossible to stop him. Break-up of Gilchrist and Hayden's 172-run partnership Period Gilchrist - Balls Runs Hayden - Balls Runs First 10 overs (46 runs) 30 31 31 14 Next 12.5 overs (126 runs) 53 88 25 24 More stats With this win, Australia extended their unbeaten run in World Cup matches to 29, and their winning streak to 23. The last time they were beaten was on May 23, 1999, when they lost to Pakistan by ten runs. (Click here for their list of World Cup results.) This was Gilchrist's third successive fifty-plus score in a World Cup final. He had scored 54 against Pakistan at Lord's in 1999 and 57 against India at Johannesburg in 2003. This was the 100th time that Gilchrist and Hayden were opening in ODIs, and they made it a special occasion by putting together 172, their best in ODIs, improving upon the 170 they added against South Africa at Durban in 2002. This was their 16th century stand for the first wicket, which equals the record held by Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly. Tendulkar and Ganguly, though, opened in 117 innings. The stand was the highest for the first wicket in a World Cup final, obliterating the 129 that Mike Brearley and Geoff Boycott added in 1979. Gilchrist and Hayden had also posted 105 for the opening wicket in the 2003 final against India, which is the only other century stand in a World Cup decider. It is also the second-highest partnership for all wickets in a World Cup final, after the 234-run stand between Ricky Ponting and Damien Martyn in the 2003 edition. Gilchrist is the fifth batsman to score a hundred in a World Cup final, after Clive Lloyd (102 in 1975), Viv Richards (138 in 1979), Aravinda de Silva (107 in 1996) and Ponting (140 in 2003). He is the fourth wicketkeeper - after Dave Houghton, Andy Flower and Rahul Dravid - to score a century in World Cups. Gilchrist completed 9000 ODI runs and 1000 World Cup runs during the course of his 149. Gilchrist slammed eight sixes in his knock, which equals the World Cup record for most sixes in a single innings, which is jointly held by Ponting and Imran Nazir. Gilchrist also had a good game with the gloves, and when he snaffled Upul Tharanga, he became the first wicketkeeper to get to 50 dismissals behind the stumps. This was the second-highest opening partnership against Sri Lanka in World Cups. The highest was by an Australian pair too - Rick McCosker and Alan Turner added 182 at The Oval in 1975. These are also Australia's two best first-wicket stands in World Cups. Sri Lanka didn't have much to celebrate, but there was one important personal milestone for Sanath Jayasuriya - when he reached 58, he became only the second batsman, after Sachin Tendulkar, to get to 12,000 ODI runs. Jayasuriya now has 12,005 runs from 390 ODIs, at an average of 33.25. With Kumar Sangakkara scoring 54 as well, this was a pretty good match for wicketkeepers. It was the first time in the World Cup that two keepers scored a hundred and a half-century in the same game. Glenn McGrath finished with just one wicket, but that was enough to lift his tally in the tournament to 26, the highest by any bowler in a single World Cup. Chaminda Vaas had a forgettable game, conceding 54 from eight overs, during the course of which he became the sixth bowler to concede more than 1000 runs in World Cups. He joins Wasim Akram, Javagal Srinath, Muralitharan, Jayasuriya and McGrath. Ponting's run-out was the 13th instance of a captain being dismissed in such a manner in this tournament.

In 2007, teams were split into four groups of four each but the experiment backfired when India and Pakistan bowed out in the first round, considerably robbing the tournament of commercial and spectator interest. The latest format, though, gave the teams more chances of recovering from a poor start. Teams were split into two groups of seven each, every team playing the other in the group once. The top four from each group would qualify for the quarter-finals.Initially, the four subcontinent teams were due to host the tournament, but the terror attack on the Sri Lanka team bus in Lahore in 2009, and the deteriorating security situation, led to Pakistan being dropped as a co-host. The matches were then shared between India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.Innovations It was the first World Cup to use the DRS, and Super Over for deciding tied matches (though not for the group matches).Group stages The tournament began with a series of one-sided games, with the minnows Kenya and Canada getting thrashed. Netherlands gave England a scare by posting 292 but failed to defend it. Pakistan, too, overcame a scare against Canada in a low-scoring game. Bangalore hosted two thrillers: the match between India and England ended in a tie and England lost to Ireland in another close match. Ireland looked all but out of the contest at 111 for 5, chasing a massive 328, but Kevin O'Brien played the innings of his life - 113 - to give his side one of their best wins. Bangladesh were rolled over for 58 by West Indies, leading to unruly behaviour from their fans, but the team regained pride when they beat England in a nail-biter in the following game.

Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Australia and New Zealand qualified from Group A while South Africa, India, England and West Indies made it from the other group. India knocked out defending champions Australia - in search of their fourth consecutive title while Pakistan thrashed West Indies by ten wickets after bundling them out for 112. South Africa were comfortably placed to beat New Zealand but choked - not for the first time in an ICC tournament - and their batting collapsed to Jacob Oram in a vitriolic quarter-final; Sri Lanka hammered England by ten wickets in front of home fans in Colombo.The semis In the first semi-final in Colombo, Sri Lanka restricted New Zealand to 217 and overcame jitters towards the end to win by five wickets. In the second semi-final, the organisers got what they had hoped for - an India-Pakistan clash in a knockout. Sachin Tendulkar was dropped as many as five times on his way to 85 and India posted a competitive 260 in Mohali, with Wahab Riaz taking a five-wicket haul. The chase was tantalising but Pakistan failed to soak up the pressure as the game wore on and lost regular wickets. Misbah-ul-Haq, caught in two minds whether to attack or play safe, was left with too much to do in the end, as Pakistan succumbed to their fifth consecutive defeat against India in World Cup matches.The final India were in their third World Cup final and their first at home. Sri Lanka made it to their second consecutive final but the partisan crowd was always going to test them. Mahela Jayawardene overcame that pressure to score a poetic century, guiding Sri Lanka to 274 and leaving India to pull off the highest chase in a World Cup final. There was a hush when India lost Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag early, but Gautam Gambhir and Virat Kohli revived hopes with a stand of 83. Then came the captain's masterstroke. MS Dhoni chose to promote himself ahead of the in-form Yuvraj Singh, with India needing 160 from 28 overs. Gambhir fell for 97 but India still had the upper hand with Dhoni steadying the nerves at the other end. Yuvraj Singh joined Dhoni and the pair snatched all hope for the visitors with a flurry of boundaries. Dhoni's winning six over long-on, followed by a stylish bat twirl that rested under his arm pit, became the tournament's snapshot as India won the World Cup after 28 years. Yuvraj, who fought off illness through the World Cup, picked up the Man of the Tournament award.Last hurrah Muttiah Muralitharan, who had quit Tests a year earlier, bowed out of international cricket after the final. Pakistan's Shoaib Akhtar announced midway through the tournament that he was quitting international cricket.Not to be forgotten Compared to the 2007 World Cup, the tournament was a resounding success, thanks largely to the fact that India, the powerhouse of world cricket, triumphed at home. The ICC got the format right, though it was probably their good fortune that India and Pakistan didn't get eliminated in the quarter-finals. There was a controversy, though, barely days after the final. In a bid to make the tournament even more competitive, the ICC had decided to limit the 2015 and 2019 editions to just the ten Test nations. However, following a wave of protests from the Associates, the ICC later decided to revert to the 14-team format for the 2015 edition, giving the Associates a chance to play in the tournament via a qualifier. Ireland's inspiring win against England fuelled the debate that it was unfair to cull the Associates and that a ten-team World Cup would not give the tournament a 'global' feel.

Mixx Mixx", " Last updated on 29 March 201529 March 2015.From the section Cricket Australia overwhelmed New Zealand to win the World Cup for a fifth time at an ecstatic Melbourne Cricket Ground. New Zealand lost influential captain Brendon McCullum to the fifth ball of the match and were bowled out for 183. Grant Elliott resisted with 83, while Mitchell Starc, Mitchell Johnson and James Faulkner shared eight wickets. Australia rarely looked troubled, sealing a seven-wicket win in 33.1 overs, with captain Michael Clarke scoring 74 and Steve Smith 56 not out. Clarke, in his final one-day international, was given a standing ovation by the record 93,000 crowd and welcomed by his team-mates on the boundary when he was bowled by Matt Henry with eight required. He was part of the Australia team that last lifted the trophy in 2007, with this success extending their record for most World Cups won. No other team has more than two. Australia's win was the second in as many tournaments by a host nation after India's triumph four years ago. It provided a joyous end to an emotional Australian summer which saw batsman Phillip Hughes die after being struck on the neck by a ball in Sydney in November. In their first final, after six previous semi-final defeats, New Zealand were blown away. Their path to Melbourne came with eight successive wins, all on home soil, and most of the pre-match speculation was of how McCullum's men would deal with the change in conditions. They won what was thought to be a crucial toss, but the life was sucked from their innings almost as soon as it began. The talismanic McCullum, so often a slayer of new-ball attacks throughout the tournament, aimed two wild swings at Starc, missed with both, then was bowled by a brilliant yorker. Far from the batting paradise predicted, the pitch was slightly two-paced and offered both turn and some uneven bounce. But that is to take nothing away from the Australia pace attack, Starc in particular, who bowled with hostility and found movement both in the air and off the seam. New Zealand clung on without progressing, but when Glenn Maxwell's off-spin got through a lazy Martin Guptill stroke and Kane Williamson patted back to Johnson, they seemed in disarray. However, from 39-3, they painstakingly rebuilt through semi-final hero Elliott and Ross Taylor. Elliott, who successfully overturned a Maxwell lbw decision on 15, scored almost exclusively through the off-side to become only the fifth man to register a half-century in the semi-final and final of the same World Cup. Taylor made 40 in a stand of 111 provided a platform for the batting powerplay. Yet it was the powerplay that began New Zealand's slide, as Faulkner returned to have Taylor athletically caught behind by Brad Haddin and bowl Corey Anderson two balls later. When Luke Ronchi played an awful waft to be caught at slip off Starc, three wickets had been lost for one run in eight balls. There was no support for Elliott, who was caught behind attempting to heave Faulkner and, when Maxwell superbly ran out non-striker Tim Southee with a direct hit for the final wicket, it was the perfect demonstration of Australia's dominance. In all, New Zealand lost seven wickets for 33 runs. Though Aaron Finch inside-edged on to his pad to be caught and bowled by Trent Boult, David Warner's brisk 45 gave Australia's chase early momentum. After he was caught hooking Henry, there began a period of pressure that Clarke and Smith battled to absorb, the latter needing the fortune of seeing the bails stay unmoved as a Henry delivery trickled on to the base of the stumps. It would be New Zealand's last chance, as Clarke's cuts and drives down the ground accelerated Australia towards victory. He could not see the job through, but Smith became the first man to score five successive World Cup half-centuries then pulled Henry for the winning runs.

NEW ZEALAND WILL RESUME THEIR INNINGS ON WEDNESDAY. ICC STATEMENT: Due to adverse weather, the match officials have declared that no further play is possible in today's semi-final between India and New Zealand at Old Trafford. The match will recommence tomorrow (Wednesday 10 July) at 10.30am BST (3 pm IST), weather permitting. The game will continue where it was halted - New Zealand will complete their 50-over innings and India will then complete their 50-over innings, weather permitting. The match may be shortened dependent on conditions. For the match to be completed, India are required to bat for at least 20 overs. If after the reserve day the match has still not reached a result, India will progress to the final given their higher finishing position in the group stage. 22:44 IST 22:38 IST 22:35 IST -- Umpires and officials are having a chat with captains. 22:21 IST -- BAD NEWS! It's raining again. The covers are back. 22:20 IST -- UPDATE: The cut-off time for a 20-over chase is 11:05 pm IST, and India's target would be 148 22:00 IST -- UPDATE: GOOD NEWS! 21:30 IST -- UPDATE: Rain has gotten heavier. Match unlikely to restart today. 21:20 IST -- UPDATE: 21:10 IST -- UPDATE: 21:00 IST -- We have officially started losing overs if there is a resumption today. We will lose one over for every four minutes. 20:50 IST -- UPDATE: WHAT IF Scenarios: 19:50 IST -- UPDATE: The cut-off time tonight is two hours after normal end of play, that's 00:30 IST As we wait for rain to stop, let's re-examine the reserve-day rules: The reserve day will only come into operation if the minimum 20 overs-per-side match needed for a result under the Duckworth-Lewis method for rain-affected games cannot be finished today. In that case, the match would continue Wednesday from where it left off rather than be re-started. But if a 20 overs per side match cannot be completed on Wednesday as well, India would go through to Sunday's final at Lord's on the basis of having finished first to New Zealand's fourth in the 10-team group stage. 19:35 IST -- UPDATE: 19:00 IST RAIN UPDATE: It has gotten heavier in Manchester.

Teams have lined-up for the national anthems Amazing atmosphere at the Old Trafford CAPTAINS' TAKE: Virat Kohli | India captain: We would've batted first. Fresh wicket, nice and hard, and not moist. A bit of rain around as well, the ball will get wet as the game goes on. It could remain decent throughout the game. It's going to remain similar throughout the course of the game - we have done well in Manchester. We have had two good games in Manchester, and it's about focussing on the basics. We need to remember why we are in the semis. Chahal comes back in for Kuldeep Yadav. Kane Williamson | New Zealand captain: We're going to have a bat. It looks like a good surface. We have played a number of games here. A toss-up with the overheads, but it'll be around all day, so we need to get the job first up. We are used to the routine, but we have a great opportunity to put up a good performance against a side like India. Ferguson comes in for Southee. PLAYING XIs: New Zealand: India: TEAM NEWS: TOSS: New Zealand captain Kane Williamson wins toss, opts to bat against India at Old Trafford Pitch Report, courtesy VVS Laxman: Even though it's overcast, the wicket looks dry. It's a fresh wicket, and it's definitely a bat-first wicket. It's a semi-final, there will be a lot of scoreboard pressure. Perhaps India might try Jadeja for batting depth. Jadhav has got Williamson and Taylor out before, so he might pip Karthik into the Playing XI.

Two teams without a World Cup title between them in 44 years of the men's competition. After 100 overs, the last couple of which contained almost as much drama as a few previous finals in their entirety, nothing could separate England and New Zealand. For the first time in World Cup history, a Super Over was required to determine the winner.Asked to score 16 from six balls, Jimmy Neesham coolly struck Jofra Archer's second legitimate delivery way back into the Mound Stand, making the equation seven off four. A brace of twos followed, before Archer's bumper took Neesham off strike. Martin Guptill, at the end of a tournament of personal trial, needing to hit two more otherwise England would take the trophy on boundaries scored. Archer found a yorker, Guptill found deep midwicket and Jason Roy's throw found Guptill short; Jos Buttler completed the run-out at full stretch to end all those years of hurt and an afternoon of exquisite agony.What the playing conditions say- In the event of a Super Over tie, the team that hit more boundaries (combined from the main match and the Super Over) shall be the winner- If the number of boundaries hit by both teams is equal, the team whose batsmen scored more boundaries during its innings in the main match (ignoring the Super Over) shall be the winner- If still equal, a count-back from the final ball of the Super Over will be conducted. The team with the higher scoring delivery shall be the winner. If a team loses two wickets during its over, then any unbowled deliveries will be counted as dot ballsEngland had only got close in their chase thanks to Buttler and Ben Stokes, whose 110-run stand lifted the home nation from peril at 86 for 4. The pair walked out again to scramble 15 from an over of Trent Boult: pressure back on New Zealand. They responded by sending out Neesham, a man who not so long ago was contemplating quitting the game, to face Archer, in his 14th ODI. Only one could finish a hero.That said, there were heroes aplenty on both sides. For the second game in succession, New Zealand put up a score in the region of 240 and defended it with every fibre of their Blackcapped beings. Just when they appeared to have the game won, a man born in Christchurch ripped it from their hands, in a manner at once extraordinary and unbelievable. Stokes finished unbeaten on 84, though like Guptil he too could not manage a two from the final ball of England's innings to win the game in regulation time.New Zealand had gone into the final over believing that the trophy was in their grasp. England needed 15, Stokes carrying a country's hopes - not to mention the almost unbearable weight of history - on his shoulders. The first two balls bowled by Boult were dots, before Stokes mowed the third for six into the crowd at midwicket. Then came an intervention that was either cruel or miraculous, depending on your perspective. Stokes, diving for his ground as he attempted to complete a second run, diverted Guptill's throw off his bat - inadvertantly - past wicketkeeper Tom Latham and away to the rope for four more.Jos Buttler runs out Martin Guptill to crown England champions•Getty ImagesStokes immediately held up his hands in apology, but with no sign that he had changed the course of his run to intercept the throw, it went down as a second consecutive six. That left England needing three from two, though Boult kept his cool to twice run out the non-striker coming back for a second and send the game into a Super Over.The previous over, something almost as extraordinary had occurred: having caught Stokes on the boundary at wide long-on, Boult stepped on the rope before he could relay the ball back in to Guptill. Instead of Stokes departing for 63, with England needing 22 off eight and Nos. 9 and 10 at the crease, he was granted another shot at redemption. Instead of Kolkata Part II, this was to become his finest hour, Stokes ultimately crowned man of the match after leading England to victory in a World Cup final at the fourth time of asking.Watch on Hotstar (India only): Highlights of the heart-stopping World Cup finalThere is a new name on the cup, then, but they didn't half keep the engravers waiting. England had built towards this competition for four years, planned for it, yearned for it - and when the moment came, the outburst was rapturous. Staid and stuffy Lord's had become a cauldron of emotion long before that last passage of play.New Zealand deserved better than to end up the fall guys again. Their captain, Kane Williamson, orchestrated his men in the field to squeeze England's chase until it became unbearable. First Buttler fell with 46 required from the last 31 balls, Lockie Ferguson delivering what seemed to be the killer blow. Stokes staggered on, even as the tail became expendable. Ultimately, the fact England had scored 24 boundaries in their innings, compared to New Zealand's 16, was the decisive factor.Watch on Hotstar (USA only): Highlights of the epic World Cup 2019 finalThat one of England's fours was effectively an overthrow may always rankle, as well as a couple of the umpiring decisions that went the other way. Williamson, who made only 30 but captained with nerves of steel and was named man of the tournament, called the runs via Stokes' deflection \"a shame\" but suggested that for New Zealand, beaten finalists for the second World Cup running, it was just not meant to be.The very first delivery of England's chase gave an indication of how nerve-shredding a contest this would become. Boult produced a curving inswinger to hit Jason Roy squarely on the front pad and 4.8m primarily rugby-loving people went up in unison. Marais Erasmus shook his head and although New Zealand chose to review, it was Roy who benefited from the marginal nature of umpire's call.Eoin Morgan holds the World Cup aloft•Getty ImagesThe opening exchanges were a blur of black and blue, with bruises on both sides, when Matt Henry finally located Roy's outside edge. England's opening partnership has been totemic and Roy had swaggered into this final, so the importance of his dismissal was twofold in that it both dented English confidence and deprived the chase of a man who might quickly reduce the odds in their favour.With Henry bowling a beautiful spell and Joe Root unable to find his rhythm, New Zealand clawed their way into the ascendency. The tension was enervating, Lord's subdued. Colin de Grandhomme dropped Bairstow off his own bowling, a reaction chance to his midriff, as New Zealand strung together three maidens in a row. Root then cracked: hit on the pads and then beaten when he gave de Grandhomme the charge, he next threw his bat at a wide outswinger to be caught behind.In stultifying conditions, New Zealand applied a choke hold. Bairstow dragged on against the pace of Ferguson, who then brilliantly caught Eoin Morgan running in from deep point. Meanwhile de Grandhomme, playing the role of a latter-day Madan Lal, bowled ten overs off the reel.Nothing about this contest was straightforward, including the decision at the toss, which had been delayed by 15 minutes due to early morning rain. Williamson chose to bat, in keeping with the dominant trend at this tournament - runs on the board matter. While England bowled well enough, a Powerplay score of 33 for 1 left the teams circling each other warily; New Zealand happy to have only lost Guptill, England eager to send back Williamson, too, as quickly as possible.With Henry Nicholls providing the first half-century by a New Zealand opener since the opening game, they were able to establish a foothold. As in the group match between these two, Nicholls was given out lbw on zero by a Chris Woakes delivery that was going over the stumps; this time, on the biggest stage, he had the wherewithal to use New Zealand's review.England thought they might have removed Guptill inside the first couple of overs, too, only for Erasmus to correctly adjudge that the ball from Archer had flicked the batsman's trousers rather than outside edge. Guptill's response was to try and hit a way out of his rut, ramping Archer for six and smashing another boundary back down the ground. But Woakes brought one back inside an expansive drive to hit the back leg, and Guptill's wasted review was to have consequences later on.Nicholls and Williamson played sensibly to put on 74 but, whether it was the pitch or the occasion, the innings nevertheless began to enter a gentle tailspin from the moment Williamson was removed by Liam Plunkett - DRS again required to overturn the on-field call. Nicholls chopped on against another Plunkett cross-seamer four overs later, and then New Zealand were left to curse their luck when Ross Taylor was given out lbw, despite ball-tracking showing the ball going over the top of leg stump. It would not end up being the only talking point of the day.Jofra ArcherBen StokesNew ZealandEnglandEngland vs New ZealandICC Cricket World CupAlan Gardner is a deputy editor at ESPNcricinfo. @alanroderick Matches (11) Matches (11) (11) SL v PAK (1) SL v PAK (1) (1) SA-W in ENG (1) SA-W in ENG (1) (1) County DIV1 (5) County DIV1 (5) (5) County DIV2 (3) County DIV2 (3) (3) TNPL (1) TNPL (1) (1) Live • 2nd TEST • Galle • 2nd TEST (15.1 ov) & Day 3 - Session 2: Sri Lanka lead by 206 runs.

England had built towards this competition for four years, planned for it, yearned for it - and when the moment came, the outburst was rapturous. Staid and stuffy Lord's had become a cauldron of emotion long before that last passage of play. New Zealand deserved better than to end up the fall guys again. Their captain, Kane Williamson, orchestrated his men in the field to squeeze England's chase until it became unbearable. First Buttler fell with 46 required from the last 31 balls, Lockie Ferguson delivering what seemed to be the killer blow. Stokes staggered on, even as the tail became expendable. Ultimately, the fact England had scored 24 boundaries in their innings, compared to New Zealand's 16, was the decisive factor. Watch on Hotstar (USA only): Highlights of the epic World Cup 2019 final That one of England's fours was effectively an overthrow may always rankle, as well as a couple of the umpiring decisions that went the other way. Williamson, who made only 30 but captained with nerves of steel and was named man of the tournament, called the runs via Stokes' deflection \"a shame\" but suggested that for New Zealand, beaten finalists for the second World Cup running, it was just not meant to be. The very first delivery of England's chase gave an indication of how nerve-shredding a contest this would become. Boult produced a curving inswinger to hit Jason Roy squarely on the front pad and 4.8m primarily rugby-loving people went up in unison. Marais Erasmus shook his head and although New Zealand chose to review, it was Roy who benefited from the marginal nature of umpire's call.

England's opening partnership has been totemic and Roy had swaggered into this final, so the importance of his dismissal was twofold in that it both dented English confidence and deprived the chase of a man who might quickly reduce the odds in their favour. With Henry bowling a beautiful spell and Joe Root unable to find his rhythm, New Zealand clawed their way into the ascendency. The tension was enervating, Lord's subdued. Colin de Grandhomme dropped Bairstow off his own bowling, a reaction chance to his midriff, as New Zealand strung together three maidens in a row. Root then cracked: hit on the pads and then beaten when he gave de Grandhomme the charge, he next threw his bat at a wide outswinger to be caught behind. In stultifying conditions, New Zealand applied a choke hold. Bairstow dragged on against the pace of Ferguson, who then brilliantly caught Eoin Morgan running in from deep point. Meanwhile de Grandhomme, playing the role of a latter-day Madan Lal, bowled ten overs off the reel. Nothing about this contest was straightforward, including the decision at the toss, which had been delayed by 15 minutes due to early morning rain. Williamson chose to bat, in keeping with the dominant trend at this tournament - runs on the board matter. While England bowled well enough, a Powerplay score of 33 for 1 left the teams circling each other warily; New Zealand happy to have only lost Guptill, England eager to send back Williamson, too, as quickly as possible. With Henry Nicholls providing the first half-century by a New Zealand opener since the opening game, they were able to establish a foothold. As in the group match between these two, Nicholls was given out lbw on zero by a Chris Woakes delivery that was going over the stumps; this time, on the biggest stage, he had the wherewithal to use New Zealand's review. England thought they might have removed Guptill inside the first couple of overs, too, only for Erasmus to correctly adjudge that the ball from Archer had flicked the batsman's trousers rather than outside edge. Guptill's response was to try and hit a way out of his rut, ramping Archer for six and smashing another boundary back down the ground. But Woakes brought one back inside an expansive drive to hit the back leg, and Guptill's wasted review was to have consequences later on. Nicholls and Williamson played sensibly to put on 74 but, whether it was the pitch or the occasion, the innings nevertheless began to enter a gentle tailspin from the moment Williamson was removed by Liam Plunkett - DRS again required to overturn the on-field call. Nicholls chopped on against another Plunkett cross-seamer four overs later, and then New Zealand were left to curse their luck when Ross Taylor was given out lbw, despite ball-tracking showing the ball going over the top of leg stump. It would not end up being the only talking point of the day.

Two teams without a World Cup title between them in 44 years of the men's competition. After 100 overs, the last couple of which contained almost as much drama as a few previous finals in their entirety, nothing could separate England and New Zealand. For the first time in World Cup history, a Super Over was required to determine the winner. Asked to score 16 from six balls, Jimmy Neesham coolly struck Jofra Archer's second legitimate delivery way back into the Mound Stand, making the equation seven off four. A brace of twos followed, before Archer's bumper took Neesham off strike. Martin Guptill, at the end of a tournament of personal trial, needing to hit two more otherwise England would take the trophy on boundaries scored. Archer found a yorker, Guptill found deep midwicket and Jason Roy's throw found Guptill short; Jos Buttler completed a full-length stumping to end all those years of hurt and an afternoon of exquisite agony. In the event of a Super Over tie, the team that hit more boundaries (combined from the main match and the Super Over) shall be the winner If the number of boundaries hit by both teams is equal, the team whose batsmen scored more boundaries during its innings in the main match (ignoring the Super Over) shall be the winner If still equal, a count-back from the final ball of the Super Over will be conducted. The team with the higher scoring delivery shall be the winner. If a team loses two wickets during its over, then any unbowled deliveries will be counted as dot balls England had only got close in their chase thanks to Buttler and Ben Stokes, whose 110-run stand lifted the home nation from peril at 86 for 4. The pair walked out again to scramble 15 from an over of Trent Boult: pressure back on New Zealand. They responded by sending out Neesham, a man who not so long ago was contemplating quitting the game, to face Archer, in his 14th ODI. Only one man could finish a hero. That said, there were heroes aplenty on both sides. For the second game in succession, New Zealand put up a score in the region of 240 and defended it with every fibre of their Blackcapped beings. Just when they appeared to have the game won, a man born in Christchurch ripped it from their hands, in a manner at once extraordinary and unbelievable. Stokes finished unbeaten on 89, though like Guptil he too could not manage a two from the final ball of England's innings to win the game in regulation time. New Zealand had gone into the final over believing that the trophy was in their grasp. England needed 15, Stokes carrying a country's hopes - not to mention the almost unbearable weight of history - on his shoulders. The first two balls bowled by Boult were dots, before Stokes mowed the third for six into the crowd at midwicket. Then came an intervention that was either cruel or miraculous, depending on your perspective. Stokes, diving for his ground as he attempted to complete a second run, diverted Guptill's throw off his bat - inadvertantly - past wicketkeeper Tom Latham and away to the rope for four more. Stokes immediately held up his hand in apology, but with no sign that he had changed the course of his run to intercept the throw, it went down as a second consecutive six. That left England needing three from two, though Boult kept his cool to twice run out the non-striker coming back for a second and send the game into a Super Over. The previous over, something almost as extraordinary had occurred: having caught Stokes on the boundary at wide long-on, Boult stepped on the rope before he could relay the ball back in to Guptill. Instead of Stokes departing for 63, with England needing 22 off eight and Nos. 9 and 10 at the crease, he was granted another shot at redemption. Instead of Kolkata Part II, this was to become his finest hour, Stokes ultimately crowned man of the match after leading England to victory in a World Cup final at the fourth time of asking.

When you love sport, you understand how it can take you to places little else can. You could watch it all your life and never quite fathom what happened between 6.30 and 7.30pm in two sun-kissed rectangles of grass seven or so miles apart across England's capital city. A World Cup final that might just be the greatest game of cricket in history, a Wimbledon men's final longer than any that has come before. Because this was summer's sporting day of days, they stepped hand in hand. You couldn't watch and you couldn't look away. You hated it and you loved it and you lost yourself completely to it. No-one had ever seen Lord's like this, a beautiful sedate museum turned into a cavorting mess. No-one had really seen cricket like this. There is a line often brought out when sport does these sorts of things - you couldn't write this - and a hoary riposte: haven't you seen Star Wars, or read Harry Potter? On a day when sometimes nothing appeared to make sense, both these contradictory positions became true. You couldn't write it, because it was a plotline too twisted to make dramatic sense, too confusing, too remote from what has gone before. We're OK with spaceships and child wizards because they have been imagined before. Plenty had dreamed of England winning the World Cup. That's where logic waved farewell. A match that ended in a tie to produce a tie-breaker that also ended in a tie. A final over that contained a six that was a six and also contained a six that wasn't a six at all but actually a two and a four, which meant the final over wasn't the final over any more either. When you try to navigate your way through those 60 hallucinogenic minutes you keep coming up against these impossible riddles: New Zealand's Martin Guptill facing the first ball of the match and the last one too; a tournament that England's men had never won before won with a winning margin that wasn't even a winning margin. Seven weeks of cricket and it came down to the final dusty half-metre at the spiritual home of the sport. A final that for so long was slow-motion cricket ending at a pace that took the breath from your lungs and the strength from your legs. Cricket that was a throwback to 20 years ago suddenly leaping into the unknown. It was unprecedented and it was also a very English way to win a World Cup. Extra time at Wembley in 1966, extra time in Sydney in 2003. A champagne super over in London, that strange comforting familiarity of feeling absolutely awful watching England do something you had always hoped they might. Eoin Morgan's men were supposed to be rompers in this tournament. They were the demolition men who took on big totals and danced across the finish line. You knew deep down it was never going to be easy. It never is with England. You just didn't know it was going to be this hard. There were scoring rates from the late 1990s and an innings perfectly pitched to that fragile, panicked era of England one-day batting, as if the cavalier swordsmen of the current team had been replaced by a cricketing historical re-enactment society. Romp? It was like a four-hour penalty shootout, at least until it became a shootout, at which point England's final over felt like a lifetime and then produced one more for each side that took another half-hour. Panic on the posh streets of London, panic in the living-rooms of the nation. As the contest swung one way then the other and then back again, Lord's was awash with pacers - men and women walking, hopping, striding purposely to nowhere at all. As Ben Stokes dragged England to the brink, into the abyss and then out again, a country had long forgotten that watching sport is supposed to be fun. All the while, horrible sums. 100 needed from 88. 80 from 66. 65 off 48, people standing up to cheer a wide. It was 44 from 26 as the final hour began. Men in crisp cotton shirts and chinos swigging pink champagne direct from the bottle. 39 off 24, 34 needed off the last three overs, 24 off two. The 50th over began at 6.55. 15 runs required. Two balls later, 15 needed from four, and then, in two balls and four minutes, came 12 impossible runs. At 7pm, England needed two to win. Mark Wood was run out by a mile, and so the final act began: a World Cup into its first ever super over at the same time as a Wimbledon final went into its first ever fifth-set tie-breaker. Both teams thought they had it won and lost in the tumult of the final 12 balls, just as both Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer could feel the Wimbledon trophy in their hands. At some distant forgotten point in the afternoon the hero was going to be Liam Plunkett until it was Colin de Grandhomme, at least until Jos Buttler took over, and then the super over began and it was suddenly Stokes until it was Buttler, except it was then Jimmy Neesham and then Jofra Archer and then Jason Roy and Buttler all over again. You realised as that final throw came in from Roy to his wicketkeeper to leave Guptill and New Zealand that tiny, vast distance short that you were lucky to have seen it and that cricket was lucky to have conjured it. Fourteen long years since the last live England game on free-to-air television, a day for the converted to testify, a chance for a whole new generation to feel the unique horrors and joys of watching England play cricket. You felt like putting an arm around the new devotees in the giddy aftermath. It's not always like this. But it can do exactly this to you. It was awful for New Zealand, fancied by no-one, so close to pulling off one of the great upsets with a brand of cricket that felt archaic until it made perfect sense. It was no sort of compensation for the brilliant Kane Williamson to be awarded man of the tournament. But it was wonderful for England, four years on from their humiliation in Adelaide at the last World Cup, and it was redemption for all those who have followed them and hoped and suffered along the way. So much happened in the golden hour that you struggle to hold on to discrete images. But there is one England supporters will never forget: 11 men in pale blue, chasing wild circles on the green Lord's outfield as the stumps lay splattered and Guptill knelt beside them, the ancient pavilion dancing, the shadows stretching, the World Cup - after 44 long years - finally won.

England win Cricket World Cup: A golden hour ends in a champagne super overBy Tom FordyceChief sports writer Last updated on 14 July 201914 July 2019.From the section Cricketcomments1230On a grey Sunday evening the sun came out at Lord's and the golden hour came.When you love sport, you understand how it can take you to places little else can. You could watch it all your life and never quite fathom what happened between 6.30 and 7.30pm in two sun-kissed rectangles of grass seven or so miles apart across England's capital city.A World Cup final that might just be the greatest game of cricket in history, a Wimbledon men's final longer than any that has come before. Because this was summer's sporting day of days, they stepped hand in hand. You couldn't watch and you couldn't look away. You hated it and you loved it and you lost yourself completely to it.No-one had ever seen Lord's like this, a beautiful sedate museum turned into a cavorting mess. No-one had really seen cricket like this.There is a line often brought out when sport does these sorts of things - you couldn't write this - and a hoary riposte: haven't you seen Star Wars, or read Harry Potter?On a day when sometimes nothing appeared to make sense, both these contradictory positions became true. You couldn't write it, because it was a plotline too twisted to make dramatic sense, too confusing, too remote from what has gone before.We're OK with spaceships and child wizards because they have been imagined before. Plenty had dreamed of England winning the World Cup. That's where logic waved farewell.A match that ended in a tie to produce a tie-breaker that also ended in a tie.

They were the demolition men who took on big totals and danced across the finish line.You knew deep down it was never going to be easy. It never is with England.

Surely will go down as the greatest game in the modern era. What a magnificent final. Tense beyond belief.

It really isn't an issue!2348IComment posted by Inastate, at 23:33 14 Jul 2019Inastate23:33 14 Jul 2019New Zealand were truly magnificent but credit to England for being deserved champions, those lamenting rules need to remember it was the NRR rule that brought NZ in the semi finals in the first place.

What can you say about stokes though? Absolute redemption after the t20 final and last year. Absolute giant of a man; how he had the energy for the super over I’ll never know.

As an Englishman of course I am delighted we won, and even admit we are the best one day side in the world. But even I have to admit the cricketing gods were on our side when it mattered (Umpires decisions, DRS & Stokes unintentional '6'), that was the difference.Well played New Zealand, but ultimately England you ARE the winners, so hats off to you!:-)631KComment posted by Kzinn, at 23:47 14 Jul 2019Kzinn23:47 14 Jul 2019Fantastic match - hopefully a huge TV audience to show the powers that be at the terrestrial channels that they should be investing in cricket coverage in the future.Amazing win for England, against a superb NZ side that didn't deserve to lose.

Both teams thought they had it won and lost in the tumult of the final 12 balls, just as both Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer could feel the Wimbledon trophy in their hands. At some distant forgotten point in the afternoon the hero was going to be Liam Plunkett until it was Colin de Grandhomme, at least until Jos Buttler took over, and then the super over began and it was suddenly Stokes until it was Buttler, except it was then Jimmy Neesham and then Jofra Archer and then Jason Roy and Buttler all over again. You realised as that final throw came in from Roy to his wicketkeeper to leave Guptill and New Zealand that tiny, vast distance short that you were lucky to have seen it and that cricket was lucky to have conjured it. Fourteen long years since the last live England game on free-to-air television, a day for the converted to testify, a chance for a whole new generation to feel the unique horrors and joys of watching England play cricket. You felt like putting an arm around the new devotees in the giddy aftermath. It's not always like this. But it can do exactly this to you. It was awful for New Zealand, fancied by no-one, so close to pulling off one of the great upsets with a brand of cricket that felt archaic until it made perfect sense. It was no sort of compensation for the brilliant Kane Williamson to be awarded man of the tournament. But it was wonderful for England, four years on from their humiliation in Adelaide at the last World Cup, and it was redemption for all those who have followed them and hoped and suffered along the way. So much happened in the golden hour that you struggle to hold on to discrete images. But there is one England supporters will never forget: 11 men in pale blue, chasing wild circles on the green Lord's outfield as the stumps lay splattered and Guptill knelt beside them, the ancient pavilion dancing, the shadows stretching, the World Cup - after 44 long years - finally won.

Media playback is not supported on this device How England won an incredible Cricket World Cup final On a grey Sunday evening the sun came out at Lord's and the golden hour came.When you love sport, you understand how it can take you to places little else can. You could watch it all your life and never quite fathom what happened between 6.30 and 7.30pm in two sun-kissed rectangles of grass seven or so miles apart across England's capital city.A World Cup final that might just be the greatest game of cricket in history, a Wimbledon men's final longer than any that has come before. Because this was summer's sporting day of days, they stepped hand in hand. You couldn't watch and you couldn't look away. You hated it and you loved it and you lost yourself completely to it.No-one had ever seen Lord's like this, a beautiful sedate museum turned into a cavorting mess. No-one had really seen cricket like this.There is a line often brought out when sport does these sorts of things - you couldn't write this - and a hoary riposte: haven't you seen Star Wars, or read Harry Potter?On a day when sometimes nothing appeared to make sense, both these contradictory positions became true. You couldn't write it, because it was a plotline too twisted to make dramatic sense, too confusing, too remote from what has gone before.We're OK with spaceships and child wizards because they have been imagined before. Plenty had dreamed of England winning the World Cup. That's where logic waved farewell. Media playback is not supported on this device Wood run out off the last ball as World Cup final ends in a tie A match that ended in a tie to produce a tie-breaker that also ended in a tie. A final over that contained a six that was a six and also contained a six that wasn't a six at all but actually a two and a four, which meant the final over wasn't the final over any more either.When you try to navigate your way through those 60 hallucinogenic minutes you keep coming up against these impossible riddles: New Zealand's Martin Guptill facing the first ball of the match and the last one too; a tournament that England's men had never won before won with a winning margin that wasn't even a winning margin.Seven weeks of cricket and it came down to the final dusty half-metre at the spiritual home of the sport. A final that for so long was slow-motion cricket ending at a pace that took the breath from your lungs and the strength from your legs. Cricket that was a throwback to 20 years ago suddenly leaping into the unknown.It was unprecedented and it was also a very English way to win a World Cup. Media playback is not supported on this device Watch the moment England won the World Cup Extra time at Wembley in 1966, extra time in Sydney in 2003. A champagne super over in London, that strange comforting familiarity of feeling absolutely awful watching England do something you had always hoped they might.Eoin Morgan's men were supposed to be rompers in this tournament. They were the demolition men who took on big totals and danced across the finish line.You knew deep down it was never going to be easy. It never is with England. You just didn't know it was going to be this hard.There were scoring rates from the late 1990s and an innings perfectly pitched to that fragile, panicked era of England one-day batting, as if the cavalier swordsmen of the current team had been replaced by a cricketing historical re-enactment society.Romp? It was like a four-hour penalty shootout, at least it became a shootout, at which point England's final over felt like a lifetime and then produced one more for each side that took another half-hour.Panic on the posh streets of London, panic in the living-rooms of the nation.As the contest swung one way then the other and then back again, Lord's was awash with pacers - men and women walking, hopping, striding purposely to nowhere at all. As Ben Stokes dragged England to the brink, into the abyss and then out again, a country had long forgotten that watching sport is supposed to be fun.All the while, horrible sums. 100 needed from 88. 80 from 66. 65 off 48, people standing up to cheer a wide.It was 44 from 26 as the final hour began. Men in crisp cotton shirts and chinos swigging pink champagne direct from the bottle. 39 off 24, 34 needed off the last three overs, 24 off two.The 50th over began at 6.25. 15 runs required. Two balls later, 15 needed from four, and then, in two balls and four minutes, came 12 impossible runs.

और \"आईसीसी ट्रॉफी\" का नाम बदलकर \"आईसीसी विश्व कप क्वालीफायर\" कर दिया गया। विश्व क्रिकेट लीग आईसीसी के एसोसिएट और संबद्ध सदस्यों को अर्हता प्राप्त करने के अधिक अवसर प्रदान करने के लिए प्रदान की गई योग्यता प्रणाली थी। पूरे वर्ष में विभिन्न योग्यता रखने वाली टीमों की संख्या। 2023 विश्व कप के बाद से, केवल मेजबान राष्ट्र स्वतः योग्य होंगे। योग्यता को निर्धारित करने के लिए सभी देश लीग की एक श्रृंखला में भाग लेंगे, एक विश्व कप चक्र से अगले करने के लिए डिवीजनों के बीच स्वचालित पदोन्नति और आरोप के साथ। टूर्नामेंट thumb|upright=0.9|2007 क्रिकेट विश्व कप के कप्तान। क्रिकेट विश्व कप का प्रारूप अपने इतिहास के दौरान बहुत बदल गया है। पहले चार टूर्नामेंटों में से प्रत्येक को आठ टीमों द्वारा खेला गया था, जिन्हें चार के दो समूहों में विभाजित किया गया था। प्रतियोगिता में दो चरण, एक ग्रुप चरण और एक नॉक-आउट चरण शामिल थे। प्रत्येक ग्रुप में चार टीमों ने राउंड-रॉबिन ग्रुप चरण में एक दूसरे के साथ खेला, प्रत्येक ग्रुप में शीर्ष दो टीमों ने सेमीफाइनल में प्रवेश किया। सेमीफाइनल के विजेता फाइनल में एक दूसरे के खिलाफ खेले। रंगभेद बहिष्कार की समाप्ति के परिणामस्वरूप 1992 में पांचवें टूर्नामेंट में दक्षिण अफ्रीका के लौटने के साथ, नौ टीमों ने ग्रुप चरण में एक बार एक दूसरे से खेला और शीर्ष चार टीमों ने सेमीफाइनल में प्रवेश किया। 1996 में टूर्नामेंट का विस्तार किया गया था, जिसमें छह टीमों के दो समूह थे। प्रत्येक समूह की शीर्ष चार टीमें क्वार्टर फाइनल और सेमीफाइनल में पहुंचीं। 1999 और 2003 विश्व कप के लिए एक अलग प्रारूप का उपयोग किया गया था। टीमों को दो पूलों में विभाजित किया गया था, जिसमें प्रत्येक पूल में शीर्ष तीन टीमों को सुपर 6 से आगे बढ़ाया गया था। सुपर 6 टीमों ने तीन अन्य टीमों को खेला जो दूसरे समूह से उन्नत थीं। जब वे आगे बढ़े, तो टीमों ने उनके साथ पिछले मैचों से आगे बढ़कर अपनी टीमों को आगे बढ़ाया और उन्हें ग्रुप चरणों में अच्छा प्रदर्शन करने का प्रोत्साहन दिया। सुपर 6 चरण की शीर्ष चार टीमें सेमीफाइनल में पहुंचीं, जिसमें फाइनल में विजेता रहे। 2007 विश्व कप में प्रयुक्त प्रारूप में 16 टीमों को चार के चार समूहों में आवंटित किया गया था। प्रत्येक समूह के भीतर, टीमों ने एक-दूसरे को राउंड-रॉबिन प्रारूप में खेला। टीमों ने जीत के लिए अंक और संबंधों के लिए आधे अंक अर्जित किए। प्रत्येक समूह की शीर्ष दो टीमें सुपर 8 राउंड में आगे बढ़ीं। सुपर 8 टीमों ने अन्य छह टीमों को खेला जो विभिन्न समूहों से आगे बढ़े। टीमों ने समूह चरण की तरह ही अंक अर्जित किए, लेकिन अन्य टीमों के खिलाफ पिछले मैचों से अपने अंक को आगे बढ़ाया, जो उसी समूह से सुपर 8 चरण के लिए योग्य थे। सेमीफाइनल में सुपर 8 राउंड से शीर्ष चार टीमें सेमीफाइनल में पहुंचीं और सेमीफाइनल के विजेता फाइनल में खेले। 2011 और 2015 विश्व कप में उपयोग किए गए प्रारूप में सात टीमों के दो समूहों को दिखाया गया था, जिनमें से प्रत्येक ने राउंड-रॉबिन प्रारूप में खेला था। प्रत्येक समूह की शीर्ष चार टीमें क्वार्टर फाइनल, सेमीफाइनल और अंततः फाइनल से मिलकर नॉक आउट चरण तक आगे बढ़ीं। 2019 विश्व कप में, भाग लेने वाली टीमों की संख्या 10 तक गिर गई। हर टीम को एक बार राउंड रॉबिन प्रारूप में एक दूसरे के खिलाफ खेलने के लिए निर्धारित किया गया था, सेमीफाइनल में प्रवेश करने से पहले, 1992 विश्व कप के समान प्रारूप।", "references": ["ICC Trophy A brief history A result of the success of the inaugural 1975 World Cup, the ICC trophy was launched for all ICC Associate members in 1979 and the first tournament ran ahead of the main World Cup, with the finalists offered the additional prize of being included in the competition proper. 1979 Venue England Winner Sri Lanka Runner-up Canada As widely expected, Sri Lanka, pushing hard for Test status, won the competition, which was based at club grounds across the Midlands, although they were indebted to their depth of batting as their bowling was generally weak. But their claims for more recognition were further boosted when, three days before the final, they beat India at Old Trafford in the World Cup. The only blemish was their refusal to play Israel on political grounds, but they qualified from their group for the semi-finals by virtue of a faster run-rate, where they beat Denmark. The other semi-final produced an upset as Bermuda were defeated by Canada, who had only qualified for the last four as best runners-up of the three groups. The final was one-sided as Sri Lanka rattled up 324 for 8, although Canada battled well in reaching 264 for 5 in reply. 1982 Venue England Winner Zimbabwe Runner-up Bermuda With holders Sri Lanka having moved up to join the big boys, the second ICC Trophy was more of an open race. Again held in the Midlands, appalling weather blighted the tournament, ironic in the light of the organisers’ decision to move the event from May to June to ensure better weather. Four sides – USA, Gibraltar, Singapore and West Africa – had four games washed out. Zimbabwe and Bermuda, the favourites, emerged from their groups with 100& records and some outstanding performances. Zimbabwe trounced USA by 191 runs after Dave Houghton and Kevin Curran had scored hundreds in their 332 for 4; Bermuda went one better, smashing 348 for 9 against Malaysia in a 284-run win. The surprise package were Papua New Guinea, who beat the fancied Canadians by 20 runs to go through to the semi-finals, where Bangladesh completed the line-up with a win over Holland. Both semis were one-sided affairs, Zimbabwe bowled Bangaldesh out for 124 and passing that for the loss of two wickets, and Bermuda beating Papua New Guinea, who won the third-place play-off, by six wickets. But the final was a good contest. Bermuda made 231 for 8, Duncan Fletcher the pick of the bowlers with 3 for 34, and then Andy Pycroft’s 82 helping them to a five-wicket win with six overs to spare. Zimbabwe qualified for the 1983 World Cup finals. 1986 Venue England Winner Zimbabwe Runner-up Holland Teams 16 Format Two groups, one of seven one of nine, top two into semi-finals In contrast to 1982, the third ICC Trophy was played in good weather with only the final at Lord’s affected to any degree, the game spilling over into a second day after a four-hour rain delay. Again Midlands-based, the fine conditions favoured the batsmen. Simon Myles (Hong Kong) smacked a record 172 on the opening day of the tournament, one of 20 hundreds, and Papua New Guinea amassed 455 for 9 against Gibraltar (on the same day Holland made 425 for 4 against Israel). But there were few surprises in the results. Zimbabwe powered through their group unbeaten, while Holland, Bermuda and Demmark all reached the last four. In a repeat of the 1982 final, Zimbabwe crushed Bermuda by 10 wickets, Grant Paterson (123*) and Robin Brown (81*) putting on 205 in 38.5 overs, while the other semi was won by Holland, whose five-wicket over Denmark was largely thanks to 127 not out from Guyanese-born Rupert Gomes. The final, for which Holland brought more than 1000 spectators, was a good game. Zimbabwe posted 243 for 9, a good recovery from 101 for 4 in an innings which the rain delay robbed of momentum. Brown played the anchor with a 51-over 61, while Andy Waller injected much-needed acceleration at the end. Holland looked in a strong position on 109 for 1 after 30 overs before they lost five wickets for 30. They remained in the hunt until Steve Lubbers seriously damaged his ankle and had to retire, and the tail lacked the firepower to mount a serious challenge. 1990 Venue Holland Winner Zimbabwe Runner-up Holland Teams 17 Format Four groups, then two groups of four in the quarter-finals, top two into semi-finals The first sponsored tournament produced a repeat of the 1986 final, and again Zimbabwe triumphed over hosts Holland, in front of 3000 spectators at the HCC ground in the Hague, their well-paced chase being led by Andy Flower (69*). The early stages produced little remarkable, but it was apparent early on that Zimbabwe were a class apart. As expected, they eased into the final with an 84-run win over Bangladesh, while Holland beat Kenya thanks to P-J Baaker’s 6 for 41 (he had returned from county duty). 1993-94 Venue Kenya Winner UAE Runner-up Kenya Teams 16 Format Four groups, then two groups of four in the quarter-finals, top two into semi-finals The first tournament held outside Europe, and once again and open event with three-time winners Zimbabwe elevated to Test status. The start of the matches brought an end to a two-month drought, but thereafter the climate was ideal. The most contentious matter was the eligibility of players, the UAE attracting the most criticism as their squad of ex-pats contained only one home-grown cricketer – Sultan Zarawani, the captain. It was, in view of that, rather disappointing that they won the Trophy. The group stages produced little in terms of upsets, although group B was close, with two teams of ex-pats, the UAE and USA, battling with the home-grown Bangladeshis. The USA had the talent but lacked any discipline and they lost out. In the semi-finals, Kenya’s batting proved too much for Bermuda, their 318 for 5 led by Maurice Odumbe’s unbeaten 158, while UAE eased to a six-wicket win over Holland. Kenya seemed to have posted a winning total when they reached 281 for 6 in the final, Odumbe again top scoring with 86 and adding a hundred for the second successive match with Steve Tikolo. But UAE timed their chase to perfection, winning by two wickets with five balls in hand. Holland won the third-place play-off to book the third and final berth in the 1996 World Cup. 1997 Venue Malaysia Winner Bangladesh Runner-up Kenya Teams 16 Format Four groups, then two groups of four in the quarter-finals, top two into semi-finals The sixth ICC Trophy was bedeviled with problems, the most serious being that the Malaysians’ assurance that turf wickets would be in place was not fulfilled and so matches were played on artificial wickets. The outfields were also less than perfect, and overall the conditions were not up to the expected standard. To add to the difficulties, the weather was increasingly dreadful and one of the semi-finals, the third-place play-off and the final were all played over two days. On the field, the gulf between the big boys and the minnows was all too apparent, but Singapore came close to beating Kenya and Hong Kong beated Bermuda, one of the favourites, by three wickets. There was also a near-farcical protest when Islamic fundamentalists turned up to disrupt the Israel-Gibraltar game – the authorities had been tipped off and switched venues with the Canada-Holland tie, although the demonstrators refused to believe the authorities and started bonfires on the outfield causing the game to be abandoned. The quarter-finals onwards were disrupted by the weather, with Holland’s hopes hammered by a D/L loss to Hong Kong while other games were washed out. Kenya had an excellent half-century from Maurice Odumbe (who averaged 98.60) to thank for bailing them out after Ireland had them tied down, and then Ireland came within seven runs of beating them. In the other match, Scotland were well beaten by Bangladesh, whose large traveling support gave them excellent support. Kenya looked likely winners of the two-day final, with the previously out-of-form Steve Tikolo hammering 147 and adding 138 for the fourth wicket with Odumbe (43) as they reached 241 for 7. But rain and D/L reduced Bangladesh’s target to 166 in 25 overs. The chase was frantic, and they started the last over needing 11 with two wickets in hand. It all came down to the last ball, and Hasibul Hussain missed but scrambled a leg-bye. The third-place play-off, which decided the third qualifier for the 1999 World Cup, was won fairly comfortably by Scotland. 2001 Venue Canada Winner Holland Runner-up Namibia Teams 22 Format Four groups, then a Super League, top two into final The largest competition yet – even allowing for the late withdrawal of Italy and West Africa – with a new format involving a Super League. As was to prove the case in the main World Cup two years later, the early matches were often one-sided, and the system of carrying forward points to the second stage was far from popular and gave the two group winners – Holland and Namibia – a distinct advantage, although Scotland ran them close. In fairness, Namibia were the surprise package, and only when they met Holland in the final did their inexperience show. In a low-scoring match, Holland were 106 for 6 with 13 over remaining, chasing 196, but a 51-ball 58 not out from Jacob-Jan Esmeijer guided them to a two-wicket victory off the last ball. Scotland, who had effectively thrown away their final Super League match, were livid that third place in that had not secured them an automatic World Cup berth, were soundly beaten by Canada in the play-off. A brief history A result of the success of the inaugural 1975 World Cup, the ICC trophy was launched for all ICC Associate members in 1979 and the first tournament ran ahead of the main World Cup, with the finalists offered the additional prize of being included in the competition proper. 1979 Venue England Winner Sri Lanka Runner-up Canada As widely expected, Sri Lanka, pushing hard for Test status, won the competition, which was based at club grounds across the Midlands, although they were indebted to their depth of batting as their bowling was generally weak.

Kenya had an excellent half-century from Maurice Odumbe (who averaged 98.60) to thank for bailing them out after Ireland had them tied down, and then Ireland came within seven runs of beating them. In the other match, Scotland were well beaten by Bangladesh, whose large traveling support gave them excellent support. Kenya looked likely winners of the two-day final, with the previously out-of-form Steve Tikolo hammering 147 and adding 138 for the fourth wicket with Odumbe (43) as they reached 241 for 7. But rain and D/L reduced Bangladesh’s target to 166 in 25 overs. The chase was frantic, and they started the last over needing 11 with two wickets in hand. It all came down to the last ball, and Hasibul Hussain missed but scrambled a leg-bye. The third-place play-off, which decided the third qualifier for the 1999 World Cup, was won fairly comfortably by Scotland. 2001 Venue Canada Winner Holland Runner-up Namibia Teams 22 Format Four groups, then a Super League, top two into final The largest competition yet – even allowing for the late withdrawal of Italy and West Africa – with a new format involving a Super League. As was to prove the case in the main World Cup two years later, the early matches were often one-sided, and the system of carrying forward points to the second stage was far from popular and gave the two group winners – Holland and Namibia – a distinct advantage, although Scotland ran them close. In fairness, Namibia were the surprise package, and only when they met Holland in the final did their inexperience show. In a low-scoring match, Holland were 106 for 6 with 13 over remaining, chasing 196, but a 51-ball 58 not out from Jacob-Jan Esmeijer guided them to a two-wicket victory off the last ball. Scotland, who had effectively thrown away their final Super League match, were livid that third place in that had not secured them an automatic World Cup berth, were soundly beaten by Canada in the play-off. 1979 Venue England Winner Sri Lanka Runner-up Canada As widely expected, Sri Lanka, pushing hard for Test status, won the competition, which was based at club grounds across the Midlands, although they were indebted to their depth of batting as their bowling was generally weak. But their claims for more recognition were further boosted when, three days before the final, they beat India at Old Trafford in the World Cup. The only blemish was their refusal to play Israel on political grounds, but they qualified from their group for the semi-finals by virtue of a faster run-rate, where they beat Denmark. The other semi-final produced an upset as Bermuda were defeated by Canada, who had only qualified for the last four as best runners-up of the three groups. The final was one-sided as Sri Lanka rattled up 324 for 8, although Canada battled well in reaching 264 for 5 in reply. 1982 Venue England Winner Zimbabwe Runner-up Bermuda With holders Sri Lanka having moved up to join the big boys, the second ICC Trophy was more of an open race. Again held in the Midlands, appalling weather blighted the tournament, ironic in the light of the organisers’ decision to move the event from May to June to ensure better weather. Four sides – USA, Gibraltar, Singapore and West Africa – had four games washed out. Zimbabwe and Bermuda, the favourites, emerged from their groups with 100& records and some outstanding performances. Zimbabwe trounced USA by 191 runs after Dave Houghton and Kevin Curran had scored hundreds in their 332 for 4; Bermuda went one better, smashing 348 for 9 against Malaysia in a 284-run win. The surprise package were Papua New Guinea, who beat the fancied Canadians by 20 runs to go through to the semi-finals, where Bangladesh completed the line-up with a win over Holland. Both semis were one-sided affairs, Zimbabwe bowled Bangaldesh out for 124 and passing that for the loss of two wickets, and Bermuda beating Papua New Guinea, who won the third-place play-off, by six wickets. But the final was a good contest. Bermuda made 231 for 8, Duncan Fletcher the pick of the bowlers with 3 for 34, and then Andy Pycroft’s 82 helping them to a five-wicket win with six overs to spare. Zimbabwe qualified for the 1983 World Cup finals. 1986 Venue England Winner Zimbabwe Runner-up Holland Teams 16 Format Two groups, one of seven one of nine, top two into semi-finals In contrast to 1982, the third ICC Trophy was played in good weather with only the final at Lord’s affected to any degree, the game spilling over into a second day after a four-hour rain delay. Again Midlands-based, the fine conditions favoured the batsmen. Simon Myles (Hong Kong) smacked a record 172 on the opening day of the tournament, one of 20 hundreds, and Papua New Guinea amassed 455 for 9 against Gibraltar (on the same day Holland made 425 for 4 against Israel). But there were few surprises in the results. Zimbabwe powered through their group unbeaten, while Holland, Bermuda and Demmark all reached the last four. In a repeat of the 1982 final, Zimbabwe crushed Bermuda by 10 wickets, Grant Paterson (123*) and Robin Brown (81*) putting on 205 in 38.5 overs, while the other semi was won by Holland, whose five-wicket over Denmark was largely thanks to 127 not out from Guyanese-born Rupert Gomes. The final, for which Holland brought more than 1000 spectators, was a good game. Zimbabwe posted 243 for 9, a good recovery from 101 for 4 in an innings which the rain delay robbed of momentum. Brown played the anchor with a 51-over 61, while Andy Waller injected much-needed acceleration at the end. Holland looked in a strong position on 109 for 1 after 30 overs before they lost five wickets for 30. They remained in the hunt until Steve Lubbers seriously damaged his ankle and had to retire, and the tail lacked the firepower to mount a serious challenge. 1990 Venue Holland Winner Zimbabwe Runner-up Holland Teams 17 Format Four groups, then two groups of four in the quarter-finals, top two into semi-finals The first sponsored tournament produced a repeat of the 1986 final, and again Zimbabwe triumphed over hosts Holland, in front of 3000 spectators at the HCC ground in the Hague, their well-paced chase being led by Andy Flower (69*). The early stages produced little remarkable, but it was apparent early on that Zimbabwe were a class apart. As expected, they eased into the final with an 84-run win over Bangladesh, while Holland beat Kenya thanks to P-J Baaker’s 6 for 41 (he had returned from county duty). 1993-94 Venue Kenya Winner UAE Runner-up Kenya Teams 16 Format Four groups, then two groups of four in the quarter-finals, top two into semi-finals The first tournament held outside Europe, and once again and open event with three-time winners Zimbabwe elevated to Test status. The start of the matches brought an end to a two-month drought, but thereafter the climate was ideal. The most contentious matter was the eligibility of players, the UAE attracting the most criticism as their squad of ex-pats contained only one home-grown cricketer – Sultan Zarawani, the captain. It was, in view of that, rather disappointing that they won the Trophy. The group stages produced little in terms of upsets, although group B was close, with two teams of ex-pats, the UAE and USA, battling with the home-grown Bangladeshis. The USA had the talent but lacked any discipline and they lost out. In the semi-finals, Kenya’s batting proved too much for Bermuda, their 318 for 5 led by Maurice Odumbe’s unbeaten 158, while UAE eased to a six-wicket win over Holland. Kenya seemed to have posted a winning total when they reached 281 for 6 in the final, Odumbe again top scoring with 86 and adding a hundred for the second successive match with Steve Tikolo. But UAE timed their chase to perfection, winning by two wickets with five balls in hand. Holland won the third-place play-off to book the third and final berth in the 1996 World Cup. 1997 Venue Malaysia Winner Bangladesh Runner-up Kenya Teams 16 Format Four groups, then two groups of four in the quarter-finals, top two into semi-finals The sixth ICC Trophy was bedeviled with problems, the most serious being that the Malaysians’ assurance that turf wickets would be in place was not fulfilled and so matches were played on artificial wickets. The outfields were also less than perfect, and overall the conditions were not up to the expected standard. To add to the difficulties, the weather was increasingly dreadful and one of the semi-finals, the third-place play-off and the final were all played over two days. On the field, the gulf between the big boys and the minnows was all too apparent, but Singapore came close to beating Kenya and Hong Kong beated Bermuda, one of the favourites, by three wickets. There was also a near-farcical protest when Islamic fundamentalists turned up to disrupt the Israel-Gibraltar game – the authorities had been tipped off and switched venues with the Canada-Holland tie, although the demonstrators refused to believe the authorities and started bonfires on the outfield causing the game to be abandoned.

Holland won the third-place play-off to book the third and final berth in the 1996 World Cup. 1997 Venue Malaysia Winner Bangladesh Runner-up Kenya Teams 16 Format Four groups, then two groups of four in the quarter-finals, top two into semi-finals The sixth ICC Trophy was bedeviled with problems, the most serious being that the Malaysians’ assurance that turf wickets would be in place was not fulfilled and so matches were played on artificial wickets. The outfields were also less than perfect, and overall the conditions were not up to the expected standard. To add to the difficulties, the weather was increasingly dreadful and one of the semi-finals, the third-place play-off and the final were all played over two days. On the field, the gulf between the big boys and the minnows was all too apparent, but Singapore came close to beating Kenya and Hong Kong beated Bermuda, one of the favourites, by three wickets. There was also a near-farcical protest when Islamic fundamentalists turned up to disrupt the Israel-Gibraltar game – the authorities had been tipped off and switched venues with the Canada-Holland tie, although the demonstrators refused to believe the authorities and started bonfires on the outfield causing the game to be abandoned. The quarter-finals onwards were disrupted by the weather, with Holland’s hopes hammered by a D/L loss to Hong Kong while other games were washed out. Kenya had an excellent half-century from Maurice Odumbe (who averaged 98.60) to thank for bailing them out after Ireland had them tied down, and then Ireland came within seven runs of beating them. In the other match, Scotland were well beaten by Bangladesh, whose large traveling support gave them excellent support. Kenya looked likely winners of the two-day final, with the previously out-of-form Steve Tikolo hammering 147 and adding 138 for the fourth wicket with Odumbe (43) as they reached 241 for 7. But rain and D/L reduced Bangladesh’s target to 166 in 25 overs. The chase was frantic, and they started the last over needing 11 with two wickets in hand. It all came down to the last ball, and Hasibul Hussain missed but scrambled a leg-bye. The third-place play-off, which decided the third qualifier for the 1999 World Cup, was won fairly comfortably by Scotland. 2001 Venue Canada Winner Holland Runner-up Namibia Teams 22 Format Four groups, then a Super League, top two into final The largest competition yet – even allowing for the late withdrawal of Italy and West Africa – with a new format involving a Super League. As was to prove the case in the main World Cup two years later, the early matches were often one-sided, and the system of carrying forward points to the second stage was far from popular and gave the two group winners – Holland and Namibia – a distinct advantage, although Scotland ran them close. In fairness, Namibia were the surprise package, and only when they met Holland in the final did their inexperience show. In a low-scoring match, Holland were 106 for 6 with 13 over remaining, chasing 196, but a 51-ball 58 not out from Jacob-Jan Esmeijer guided them to a two-wicket victory off the last ball. Scotland, who had effectively thrown away their final Super League match, were livid that third place in that had not secured them an automatic World Cup berth, were soundly beaten by Canada in the play-off. 1997 Venue Malaysia Winner Bangladesh Runner-up Kenya Teams 16 Format Four groups, then two groups of four in the quarter-finals, top two into semi-finals The sixth ICC Trophy was bedeviled with problems, the most serious being that the Malaysians’ assurance that turf wickets would be in place was not fulfilled and so matches were played on artificial wickets.

The tree-division ICC World Cricket League will, for the first time, allow nations to play regular one-day cricket against similarly-ranked opponents regardless of where in the world they are based. It will also ensure that the qualifying pathway for the ICC Cricket World Cup 2011 is open to the majority of the 86 ICC Associate and Affiliate members. ICC Global Development Manager Matthew Kennedy said that regular competitive cricket was an essential part of the development plans for the sport. ‘This new structure of one-day cricket will sit on top of regional qualifying events to create a pyramid structure in which all teams have an opportunity to develop and an incentive to improve. Success will be rewarded with promotion and the ICC World Cricket League will allow us to identify the relative strengths of these member countries on a more regular basis than ever before. ‘It means, for example, that Papua New Guinea, the strongest team in the East Asia-Pacific region, will be able to test itself against similarly ranked teams from Uganda in Africa and qualifiers from Europe and the Americas. ‘Before the introduction of the ICC World Cricket League these matches would only take place every four years. Now these opportunities will come around for all countries twice as often.’ The top 13 sides have already been allocated into Divisions One, Two and Three based on their performances in the ICC Trophy Ireland 2005. The remaining places will go to the top teams from five regional qualifying events 2006. All of the matches in the ICC World Cricket League Division One will have One-Day International status.

The ICC annual conference, being held in Hong Kong, has decided that the 2015 World Cup to be held in Australia and New Zealand will comprise 14 teams and include four slots for the Associate countries. Speaking to Gulf News from Hong Kong, Mazhar Khan, the administrator of the Emirates Cricket Board, said: \"It is indeed great to be among the nations to be in contention for the 2015 World Cup.\" The UAE, recent winners of the ICC's World Cricket League Division Two championship, are among the strong contenders such as Ireland and Afghanistan for a place in the 2015 World Cup. \"The UAE will look forward to the qualifications and this decision is a sigh of relief for all Associate and even Affiliate members,\" said Khan. The historic decision was taken on the third day of the ICC's annual conference after the cricket body had come under scathing criticism from the Associate and Affiliate member-countries for keeping them out of the World Cup. It was also decided that the number of teams to take part in the Twenty20 World Cup to be held in Sri Lanka next year and in Bangladesh in 2014 will be reduced to 12. Earlier, it was decided that 16 teams would take part in the Twenty20 World Cup. The decision is also a big boost for Ireland who had shocked England in the 2011 World Cup. The ICC Chief Executive committee had recommended to the executive board that a qualifying tournament for the 2015 World Cup should be held to decide on the teams to play in the event. According to available information, the Associate members managed to overthrow the decision to make the 2015 World Cup a 10-team event as part of a deal to support the scrapping of the rotation policy in the appointment of the ICC president. The scrapping of the rotation policy would result in Pakistani and Bangladeshi candidates missing their chance to hold the highest post in world cricket. As per the rotation policy, Pakistan and Bangladesh were to nominate the next candidate for the posts of president and vice president. To pass the resolution, the ICC needed eight of the 10 full members and 38 of the 50 Associate member countries to vote in favour of the motion. With the Associate countries now being pacified, it appears this motion may now be passed.

The Board agreed with the CEC and Cricket Committee that a Twenty20 International rankings table should be created from October 1 this year. Further research should be conducted on the balls to be used in day/night Test cricket. Approved use of new balls at each end which will help bowlers to get the ball to swing for longer periods. Batsmen will be dismissed (obstructing the field) if they change course while running to prevent a run-out chance. Bowlers will be allowed to run out a non-striker who is backing up unfairly, a rule that has not been in force in recent times.

And how come it's still so long? Some of the greatest moments in Cricket World Cup history have come when traditionally non-cricket-playing nations have upset the apple cart and caused a huge shock against established nations. Be it then-associate member Zimbabwe beating Australia in 1983, unfancied Kenya destroying the West Indies in 1996 or Ireland handing out doses of humiliation against first Pakistan in 2007 and then England in 2011, the World Cup has long provided a platform for unknown teams to make their mark on the world stage. And the trend of smaller nations getting one over the giants of the game has already continued this week, with Pakistan beating highly fancied hosts England and Bangladesh surprising South Africa on consecutive days. All the tournament needs now is for an genuine minnow to knock off a full, Test-playing nation for the 2019 tournament to emulate its pioneering forebears. Except, that won't be happening in England over the next month or so, as not a single associate member has made the cut. Not in England, evidently. For this tournament, the International Cricket Council (ICC) made good on a decision initially proposed for the 2015 World Cup to reduce the number of teams dining at the top table to 10 from 14. The decision was seen as being a huge blow to associate member nations — those nations that do not qualify to play Test cricket, nor have full voting rights at the ICC — and received a far-from-positive reception when it was announced. The late Martin Crowe described the decision as \"absolute bonkers\" in a 2015 Cricinfo column. Taking a more consolatory, yet no-less-damning tone, Indian batting doyen Sachin Tendulkar described the move as \"slightly disappointing\". \"As a cricketer, I want the game to be globalised as much as possible and, according to me, this is a backwards step,\" Tendulkar said. \"We've got to find ways of encouraging the lesser teams.\" Limiting the opportunities for those nations to appear at a World Cup is not a conventional form of encouragement, yet since the 2015 World Cup, cricket has expanded its full membership list to include two of those so-called lesser teams. The promotion of former minnows Afghanistan to Test-playing nation status with Ireland in 2017 means there will not be a single associate member nation in this years tournament, the first time this has happened in Cricket World Cup history. Indeed, for the first time, two Test playing nations — Ireland and Zimbabwe — will be absent from the game's showpiece event — victims of a qualification process that saw the teams ranked ninth to 12th play off for the last two tournament places. This in itself creates issues for the other eight associate member nations with One-Day International status, who have limited opportunities to improve their rankings with matches against nations ranked higher than them, making it harder than ever to qualify. Generally, governing bodies aim to expand tournaments they run, adding new teams to help grow the sport and offer more opportunities for those who tend to exist on the periphery of the global spotlight. Football's world governing body, FIFA, only recently decided not to further expand its global showpiece from 32 to 48 teams for Qatar 2022, although the 2026 tournament in North America could yet feature that number of participants. It would be incongruous to compare the global reach of cricket to football to say the least, but in reducing the number of teams at the World Cup, the ICC risks going against the grain and contracting its share of the market. ICC chief executive David Richardson said that the aim of reducing the number of teams at the World Cup was to ensure that there were far fewer dud games. \"Every match should be very competitive,\" Richardson said. \"Having 10 teams at the 2019 World Cup will make sure that will be the case.\" Richardson — who has been replaced in his role at the ICC by India-born former broadcasting executive Manu Sawhney but has stayed on to orchestrate this year's World Cup — would not have been impressed with a first weekend of action that saw four blow-out results in favour of England, West Indies, New Zealand and Australia. Not necessarily, particularly based on evidence from the 2015 World Cup. In the pool stages of the Australia/New Zealand-hosted competition, some of the most entertaining games involved associate members, and although there were some blow-outs — Australia's 275-run victory over Afghanistan being one of them — those were not limited to matches between established teams and minnows. *Includes one wash out (Australia v Bangladesh) Matches considered close if victory is less than 4 wickets or 30 runs. Of the 20 matches between full members at the 2015 World Cup, only six could be considered close — that is where the sides were split by less than four wickets or 30 runs. The 20 matches between full members and associate members provided five close contests — and both of the matches between associate member nations were nail-biters. In pool A, Afghanistan beat Scotland by one wicket in a final-over thriller at University Oval in Dunedin. Over in pool B, Ireland squeezed past the United Arab Emirates by two wickets in an equally enthralling game at the Gabba, a match that also went down to a dramatic final over. The associates certainly provided the drama, but with those nations commanding a less-than-sizable TV market, the audience for those games has been judged to be too small and therefore expendable, much to the chagrin of New Zealand great Crowe. \"We must think bigger instead of smaller,\" Crowe said in his 2015 Cricinfo column. \"We must plan a competition that truly expands the game, and keeps it prominent in people's minds for long periods.\" The ICC might not have got the \"bigger\" part of Crowe's plea right, but there can be little doubt that they have nailed the \"long periods\" aspect of the competition. Good question. The format of this World Cup is that each of the ten teams plays each other once with the top four teams at the end of the round-robin phase heading into the semi-finals. The booing of Smith and Warner is a backhanded acknowledgement of the threat they pose to what is supposed to be England's perfect cricketing summer, writes Richard Hinds. That means a team only needs to win one do-or-die game in the tournament to reach the final, a stark contrast to global tournaments in other sports. However, despite reducing the number of teams taking part in the year's World Cup by four, there will be just one less match (48, down from 49) this year. Incredibly, this tournament is set to go for 46 days from start to finish, with the round-robin group stage lasting a whopping 38 days. That's an awful lot of cricket and even longer than the 43 days the tournament went for in 2015. In fact, the 46-day length of this tournament is the same duration as the much-maligned 2007 edition in the West Indies — a tournament that earned plenty of criticism for its half-century-plus number of matches that seemed to drag on indeterminably. Having said that, the 2019 World Cup still wont be as long as the 52-day marathon that fans were subjected to in 2011 in India. In reducing the number of teams at the World Cup, Crowe suggested that the needs of the few were being put ahead of the needs of the many. \"If we all, just for a minute, stopped and thought about what the cricket world really needs, we would soon realise that by cutting back we are only going to further feather the bulging nest of the Big Three [India, England and Australia]. Crowe's point is this: The length of the round-robin phase means that it is more likely for the 'Big Three' to shake off any unexpected results and still progress to the semi-finals. That means the biggest teams, India, England and Australia, are likely to be in with a shot of being in the top four at the end of the group stage. This would ensure the largest — and most valuable — TV markets are represented in the brief, knockout stages of the tournament. So while there may be a number of surprise group-stage results over the course of the next month, none could be considered genuine shocks, and arguably will not affect the end result of the tournament regardless.

This year, it only needs to win two.(AP: Rob Griffith)In reducing the number of teams at the World Cup, Crowe suggested that the needs of the few were being put ahead of the needs of the many.\"If we all, just for a minute, stopped and thought about what the cricket world really needs, we would soon realise that by cutting back we are only going to further feather the bulging nest of the Big Three [India, England and Australia].Crowe's point is this: The length of the round-robin phase means that it is more likely for the 'Big Three' to shake off any unexpected results and still progress to the semi-finals.That means the biggest teams, India, England and Australia, are likely to be in with a shot of being in the top four at the end of the group stage.This would ensure the largest — and most valuable — TV markets are represented in the brief, knockout stages of the tournament.So while there may be a number of surprise group-stage results over the course of the next month, none could be considered genuine shocks, and arguably will not affect the end result of the tournament regardless.Which might have been what was intended.Posted 4 Jun 20194 Jun 2019Tue 4 Jun 2019 at 7:11pm, updated 4 Jun 20194 Jun 2019Tue 4 Jun 2019 at 10:49pmShareCopy linkFacebookTwitterArticle share optionsShare this onFacebookTwitterLinkedInSend this byEmailMessengerCopy linkWhatsAppRelated StoriesTest cricket welcomes newest members Ireland and AfghanistanPakistan triumphs as England falls short in huge World Cup run chaseCricket World Cup: Five great underdog stories from World Cup's pastMore on:CricketEnglandSportUnited KingdomTop Sports StoriesanalysisManly pride jersey saga has NRL walking a fine line to prove it really 'is for everyone'NRL coach sorry for 'significant mistake' over gay pride jersey as seven players boycott matchanalysisAustralian women's cricket captain Meg Lanning eyes inaugural gold medal at Commonwealth GamesAustralian involved in horror Tour de France crash, causing favourite to withdraw with head injuryHere's what you need to know about para-sport at the Commonwealth Games'A really dumb thing': Titans embarrassed by Proctor vaping incident but deny culture problemTop StoriesCOVID hospitalisations pass January peak to hit new record.

India lost Virender Sehwag and Sachin Tendulkar early on but Gautam Gambhir and Mahendra Dhoni rebuilt the innings. Gambhir was out for 97, but captain Dhoni's brilliant unbeaten 91 led India to a famous win with 10 balls to spare. The skipper, struggling for form throughout the tournament, played the innings of his life and sealed the victory with a phenomenal straight six that sailed high into the stands, providing the catalyst for euphoric celebrations in the Wankhede Stadium. Tendulkar's early dismissal for 18 ensured there was to be no fairytale 100th international century for Mumbai's favourite son. It was a very competitive total in the end, but India's batting came through. Gambhir took a risk or two, he should have been caught, but he settled down when Dhoni came in - and Dhoni batted magnificently. They call him Mr Cool here, he never flaps and his temperament stood him in good stead. It's a good result for 50-over cricket Former England batsman Geoff Boycott on Test Match Special But wonderful innings from Gambhir and Dhoni ensured the \"Little Master\" can finally get his hands on the sport's ultimate prize at the sixth attempt as India became the first host nation to win the tournament, while Jayawardene became the first player to score a hundred in the final and finish on the losing side. Meanwhile, it was a sad end to the incredible career of Sri Lanka off-spinner Muttiah Muralitharan who, having battled injuries throughout the event, failed to take a wicket in his last international match. And when the Sri Lankan inquest begins, they will surely regret the decision to make four changes for the final, only one of which was enforced. With off-spinner Ajantha Mendis dropped, replacement bowlers Thisara Perera, Nuwan Kulasekara and Suraj Randiv managed only one wicket between them from 26.2 overs. Chasing a total 46 runs higher than the previous best under lights at the venue, prolific openers Sehwag and Tendulkar stepped out to a cacophony of noise. But it only took two balls for the mood inside the stadium to be transformed as Sehwag failed to get his bat on a full straight delivery from Lasith Malinga and was trapped in front of his stumps. Tendulkar, seemingly carrying the hopes of a billion Indians on his shoulders, soon had the crowd in a frenzy with two sumptuous boundaries off Kulasekara, but hopes of him reaching the 100 century landmark in the final were to be sadly dashed. Jayawardene's masterly hundred was his third in World Cups Kumar Sangakkara's decision to give Malinga a fourth over with the new ball proved a masterstroke as the paceman tempted Tendulkar into a swipe outside off stump and a thick edge was taken low by the captain himself behind the stumps. While Malinga wheeled away in celebration with his team-mates in pursuit, a stunned silence fell over the Wankhede. Gambhir and Virat Kohli would have been forgiven for going into their shell but the duo remained positive in seeing India to 105-2 off 20 overs. Their partnership had reached 83 when Kohli got a leading edge to a Tillakaratne Dilshan delivery and was brilliantly caught one-handed by the bowler for 35. Dhoni, whose previous highest score at the tournament was 34, took the brave decision to promote himself up the batting order above Yuvraj Singh and after a watchful start he started to find his range on his favoured off side. The right-hander's partnership with the left-handed Gambhir kept the Sri Lanka bowlers guessing and gradually the duo chipped away at the total. PAST WORLD CUP WINNERS 1975: West Indies 1979: West Indies 1983: India 1987: Australia 1992: Pakistan 1996: Sri Lanka 1999: Australia 2003: Australia 2007: Australia After taking the score past 200, Dhoni required treatment for a side strain but the skipper did not lose any focus as he leant back and chopped Muralitharan through the off side for four. Without ever batting with the fluency of Jayawardene, Gambhir worked his way to within three of a famous hundred before he was clean bowled by Perera to give Sri Lanka hope. With the score on 241-4, Sri Lanka thought they had run out Dhoni when Kapugadera's throw hit the stumps but with replays inconclusive, the India skipper was reprieved. After 46 overs, Sangakkara made the surprise decision to throw the ball to Kulasekara instead of the clearly disgruntled Muralitharan and the tactic back-fired as India helped themselves to 11 runs. The same number followed from Malinga's next over to put India on the brink of victory, before Yuvraj Singh took a single to give Dhoni the strike with four more runs needed. The wicketkeeper-batsman's stunning final blow provided a fitting end to a memorable final. Earlier, the coin toss was shrouded in confusion as the noise of the crowd rendered Sangakkara's call inaudible to match referee Jeff Crowe. He ordered a re-toss, which was won by the Sri Lanka captain, who opted to bat to the obvious frustration of his opposite number Dhoni. World Cup has been target for a long time - Dhoni When the action began, India settled the faster with seamer Zaheer Khan getting straight into rhythm. Suffocating Upul Tharanga with a tight off stump line, he bowled three consecutive maidens before having the batsman caught at slip for two off a perfect outswinger. Dilshan took his tournament run haul to exactly 500 before he was dismissed by Harbhajan Singh in the spinner's second over. The batsman attempted a sweep but the ball struck his arm and thigh pad before rebounding agonisingly on to his stumps. Veteran pair Sangakkara and Jayawardene got the innings back on track with a partnership of 62 as Sri Lanka reached 122-2 in the 28th over. But their stand was broken by Yuvraj as Sangakkara - two short of his half-century - attempted a square cut to a shorter ball and got a faint edge through to Dhoni. Jayawardene, who reached fifty from 49 balls, produced an innings of impeccable touch and timing, scoring heavily in the third man area and keeping his score moving at a run a ball to drag his team towards a competitive total. With Sreesanth leaking runs, Dhoni was forced to use part-time bowlers Tendulkar and Kohli before recalling Zaheer to the attack. But it was the irrepressible Yuvraj who struck the next blow. Thilan Samaraweera got too far across his stumps attempting to sweep and was struck on the thigh. Simon Taufel's not out decision was overturned on review, with replays showing the ball would have struck middle stump. Zaheer could not be kept out of the limelight for long and a superb slower ball totally deceived Chamara Kapugedera, who could only prod the ball tamely to Suresh Raina at mid-off. At 183-5 going into the last 10 overs, India were well on top but with Jayawardene still at the crease there was every chance of Sri Lanka posting a competitive total. With Kulasekara (32 off 30 balls) scoring quickly at the other end, the former skipper began to take calculated risks, accelerating through the 80s and 90s and bringing up his hundred off 84 balls during the batting powerplay with consecutive boundaries off Zaheer. Sangakkara gracious in defeat Kulasekara's run out brought Perera to the crease with two overs remaining, and the all-rounder did exactly what was needed, swinging from the hip to smash 22 off nine deliveries, including 16 off the last four balls of the innings. But although the late flurry propelled Sri Lanka to a healthy total, Gambhir and Dhoni ensured it was India who joined Australia and the West Indies as the only sides to win the World Cup more than once.

Their partnership had reached 83 when Kohli got a leading edge to a Tillakaratne Dilshan delivery and was brilliantly caught one-handed by the bowler for 35. Dhoni, whose previous highest score at the tournament was 34, took the brave decision to promote himself up the batting order above Yuvraj Singh and after a watchful start he started to find his range on his favoured off side. The right-hander's partnership with the left-handed Gambhir kept the Sri Lanka bowlers guessing and gradually the duo chipped away at the total. After taking the score past 200, Dhoni required treatment for a side strain but the skipper did not lose any focus as he leant back and chopped Muralitharan through the off side for four. Without ever batting with the fluency of Jayawardene, Gambhir worked his way to within three of a famous hundred before he was clean bowled by Perera to give Sri Lanka hope. With the score on 241-4, Sri Lanka thought they had run out Dhoni when Kapugadera's throw hit the stumps but with replays inconclusive, the India skipper was reprieved. After 46 overs, Sangakkara made the surprise decision to throw the ball to Kulasekara instead of the clearly disgruntled Muralitharan and the tactic back-fired as India helped themselves to 11 runs. The same number followed from Malinga's next over to put India on the brink of victory, before Yuvraj Singh took a single to give Dhoni the strike with four more runs needed. The wicketkeeper-batsman's stunning final blow provided a fitting end to a memorable final. Earlier, the coin toss was shrouded in confusion as the noise of the crowd rendered Sangakkara's call inaudible to match referee Jeff Crowe. He ordered a re-toss, which was won by the Sri Lanka captain, who opted to bat to the obvious frustration of his opposite number Dhoni. World Cup has been target for a long time - Dhoni When the action began, India settled the faster with seamer Zaheer Khan getting straight into rhythm. Suffocating Upul Tharanga with a tight off stump line, he bowled three consecutive maidens before having the batsman caught at slip for two off a perfect outswinger. Dilshan took his tournament run haul to exactly 500 before he was dismissed by Harbhajan Singh in the spinner's second over. The batsman attempted a sweep but the ball struck his arm and thigh pad before rebounding agonisingly on to his stumps. Veteran pair Sangakkara and Jayawardene got the innings back on track with a partnership of 62 as Sri Lanka reached 122-2 in the 28th over. But their stand was broken by Yuvraj as Sangakkara - two short of his half-century - attempted a square cut to a shorter ball and got a faint edge through to Dhoni. Jayawardene, who reached fifty from 49 balls, produced an innings of impeccable touch and timing, scoring heavily in the third man area and keeping his score moving at a run a ball to drag his team towards a competitive total. With Sreesanth leaking runs, Dhoni was forced to use part-time bowlers Tendulkar and Kohli before recalling Zaheer to the attack. But it was the irrepressible Yuvraj who struck the next blow. Thilan Samaraweera got too far across his stumps attempting to sweep and was struck on the thigh. Simon Taufel's not out decision was overturned on review, with replays showing the ball would have struck middle stump. Zaheer could not be kept out of the limelight for long and a superb slower ball totally deceived Chamara Kapugedera, who could only prod the ball tamely to Suresh Raina at mid-off. At 183-5 going into the last 10 overs, India were well on top but with Jayawardene still at the crease there was every chance of Sri Lanka posting a competitive total. With Kulasekara (32 off 30 balls) scoring quickly at the other end, the former skipper began to take calculated risks, accelerating through the 80s and 90s and bringing up his hundred off 84 balls during the batting powerplay with consecutive boundaries off Zaheer. Sangakkara gracious in defeat Kulasekara's run out brought Perera to the crease with two overs remaining, and the all-rounder did exactly what was needed, swinging from the hip to smash 22 off nine deliveries, including 16 off the last four balls of the innings. But although the late flurry propelled Sri Lanka to a healthy total, Gambhir and Dhoni ensured it was India who joined Australia and the West Indies as the only sides to win the World Cup more than once.

India lost Virender Sehwag and Sachin Tendulkar early on but Gautam Gambhir and Mahendra Dhoni rebuilt the innings. Gambhir was out for 97, but captain Dhoni's brilliant unbeaten 91 led India to a famous win with 10 balls to spare. The skipper, struggling for form throughout the tournament, played the innings of his life and sealed the victory with a phenomenal straight six that sailed high into the stands, providing the catalyst for euphoric celebrations in the Wankhede Stadium. Tendulkar's early dismissal for 18 ensured there was to be no fairytale 100th international century for Mumbai's favourite son. It was a very competitive total in the end, but India's batting came through. Gambhir took a risk or two, he should have been caught, but he settled down when Dhoni came in - and Dhoni batted magnificently. They call him Mr Cool here, he never flaps and his temperament stood him in good stead. It's a good result for 50-over cricket Former England batsman Geoff Boycott on Test Match Special But wonderful innings from Gambhir and Dhoni ensured the \"Little Master\" can finally get his hands on the sport's ultimate prize at the sixth attempt as India became the first host nation to win the tournament, while Jayawardene became the first player to score a hundred in the final and finish on the losing side. Meanwhile, it was a sad end to the incredible career of Sri Lanka off-spinner Muttiah Muralitharan who, having battled injuries throughout the event, failed to take a wicket in his last international match. And when the Sri Lankan inquest begins, they will surely regret the decision to make four changes for the final, only one of which was enforced. With off-spinner Ajantha Mendis dropped, replacement bowlers Thisara Perera, Nuwan Kulasekara and Suraj Randiv managed only one wicket between them from 26.2 overs. Chasing a total 46 runs higher than the previous best under lights at the venue, prolific openers Sehwag and Tendulkar stepped out to a cacophony of noise. But it only took two balls for the mood inside the stadium to be transformed as Sehwag failed to get his bat on a full straight delivery from Lasith Malinga and was trapped in front of his stumps. Tendulkar, seemingly carrying the hopes of a billion Indians on his shoulders, soon had the crowd in a frenzy with two sumptuous boundaries off Kulasekara, but hopes of him reaching the 100 century landmark in the final were to be sadly dashed. Jayawardene's masterly hundred was his third in World Cups Kumar Sangakkara's decision to give Malinga a fourth over with the new ball proved a masterstroke as the paceman tempted Tendulkar into a swipe outside off stump and a thick edge was taken low by the captain himself behind the stumps. While Malinga wheeled away in celebration with his team-mates in pursuit, a stunned silence fell over the Wankhede. Gambhir and Virat Kohli would have been forgiven for going into their shell but the duo remained positive in seeing India to 105-2 off 20 overs.

Retrieved 30 June 2013. पहला विश्व कप जून 1975 में इंग्लैंड में आयोजित किया गया था, जिसमें पहला वनडे क्रिकेट मैच केवल चार साल पहले खेला गया था। हालाँकि, पहले पुरुष टूर्नामेंट से दो साल पहले एक अलग महिला क्रिकेट विश्व कप आयोजित किया गया था, और एक टूर्नामेंट जिसमें कई अंतर्राष्ट्रीय टीमों को शामिल किया गया था, 1912 के शुरू में आयोजित किया गया था, जब ऑस्ट्रेलिया, इंग्लैंड और दक्षिण अफ्रीका के बीच टेस्ट मैचों का एक त्रिकोणीय टूर्नामेंट खेला गया था। पहले तीन विश्व कप इंग्लैंड में आयोजित किए गए थे। 1987 टूर्नामेंट के बाद से, एक अनौपचारिक रोटेशन प्रणाली के तहत देशों के बीच मेजबानी साझा की गई है, जिसमें चौदह आईसीसी सदस्यों ने टूर्नामेंट में कम से कम एक मैच की मेजबानी की है। वर्तमान प्रारूप में एक योग्यता दौर शामिल है, जो पिछले तीन वर्षों में होता है, यह निर्धारित करने के लिए कि कौन सी टीम प्रतियोगिता के किस चरण के लिए अर्हता प्राप्त करेगी। टूर्नामेंट के चरण में, स्वचालित रूप से योग्य मेजबान राष्ट्र सहित 10 टीमें, लगभग एक महीने से अधिक समय तक मेजबान देश के स्थानों पर खिताब के लिए प्रतिस्पर्धा करती हैं। टूर्नामेंट के ग्यारह संस्करणों में कुल बीस टीमों ने प्रतिस्पर्धा की है, जिसमें हाल ही में 2019 टूर्नामेंट में दस टीमों ने प्रतिस्पर्धा की है। ऑस्ट्रेलिया ने पांच बार, भारत और वेस्टइंडीज ने दो-दो बार टूर्नामेंट जीता है, जबकि पाकिस्तान, श्रीलंका और इंग्लैंड ने इसे एक-एक बार जीता है। एक सहयोगी सदस्य टीम द्वारा सर्वश्रेष्ठ प्रदर्शन तब हुआ जब केन्या ने 2003 टूर्नामेंट के सेमीफाइनल में जगह बनाई। 2019 संस्करण जीतने के बाद इंग्लैंड मौजूदा चैंपियन है। अगला टूर्नामेंट 2023 में भारत में होगा।", "references": ["Name Lastname Email address not available.

Everything is now under one umbrella; not just the Full Members but teams ranked as low as 32 in the world have a clear-cut pathway to make it to the 2023 World Cup. It's also the first time that Full Members are forced to qualify in head-to-head league competition as opposed to rankings points. Here's how qualification for World Cup 2023 will be sorted.ESPNcricinfo LtdCricket World Cup ODI Super LeagueTeams: 12 Full Members + Netherlands Matches: 24 ODIs per team starting in May 2020In the past, the ODI rankings table was used for qualification, but the table was unbalanced and not, intrinsically, fair. The easiest way to make sure a team below you couldn't overtake you on the rankings table - say Afghanistan or Ireland - was to simply not schedule a series against them. The rankings table also led to unbalanced fixture lists by virtue, for example, of India's current ranking based on 56 matches whereas Ireland's is based off 29 ODIs in the same time frame.That's no longer possible in the new structure. Each of the 13 teams will have their qualification status for the 2023 World Cup determined by an equal number of matches. Each of the 13 teams will host four home and four away series, with each consisting of three ODIs, that will count toward World Cup qualification.Due to scheduling constraints, each team will miss playing four of the 12 possible teams in the Super League.At the end of the Super League, the top seven teams in addition to World Cup host India will qualify for the 2023 World Cup. The bottom five teams will get a second chance by dropping back into the 2022 World Cup Qualifier. The team that finishes at the bottom of the ODI Super League also runs the risk of being relegated into Cricket World Cup League Two for the 2027 World Cup qualification cycle.Cricket World Cup League TwoTeams: Scotland, UAE, Nepal, Namibia, Oman, Papua New Guinea, USA Matches: 36 ODIs per team starting in August 2019The seven Associate countries ranked 14-20 will each contest a total of nine tri-series over the next two and a half years. The redesigned CWC League Two guarantees each team hosts everyone for two ODIs and tours every other country for two ODIs for a total of 24 matches. The other 12 ODIs in the structure are played as neutral-site matches.At the end of the 36 ODIs for each country, the top three teams on the points table out of the seven countries will join the bottom five teams from the ODI Super League in the 2022 World Cup Qualifier. The CWC League Two champion also has the opportunity to advance into the CWC ODI Super League for the 2027 World Cup cycle. Meanwhile, the teams that finish fourth -seventh in League Two fall back into a repechage event, the Cricket World Cup Playoff, for one more crack at going to the 2022 World Cup Qualifier.Cricket World Cup Challenge League A and BTeams: League A: Canada, Denmark, Malaysia, Qatar, Singapore, Vanuatu; League B: Bermuda, Hong Kong, Italy, Jersey, Kenya, Uganda Matches: 15 List A per team starting in September 2019This equation is a bit simpler for the teams involved. The only way to have a chance at going to the 2022 World Cup Qualifier is by winning your league. Each league consists of three single round-robin tournaments, essentially a five-match tour once a year in 2019, 2020 and 2021. At the end of the 15 matches per team, the teams that top League A and League B advance to the 2022 CWC Qualifier Playoff.2022 CWC Qualifier PlayoffTeams: Bottom four teams from CWC League Two + winners of CWC Challenge League A and B Matches: Five ODIs per team in single-round robin formatThis one is also pretty simple and is designed in the manner of the old World Cricket League. The top two teams in this six-team single round-robin event advance to the 2022 World Cup Qualifier. Unlike in years past when these matches were classified as List A only under the banner of the World Cricket League, all matches at this tournament will have ODI status.2022 CWC QualifierTeams: Bottom five teams from ODI Super League + top three teams from CWC League Two + top two teams from CWC PlayoffThe top two teams at this 10-team event will claim the final two berths available for the 2023 Cricket World Cup. All matches will have ODI status, including if any team without ODI status from the Challenge League has advanced to the Qualifier.There's another carrot up for grabs between the 13th placed team in the ODI Super League and the champion of CWC League Two. Whichever of these two teams finishes in a higher position at the CWC Qualifier will claim the 13th spot in the ODI Super League for the 2027 World Cup Qualification, while the team that finishes in the lower position will play in the CWC League Two for 2027 World Cup.It means there is a chance a Full Member could be relegated into CWC League Two by finishing last in the ODI Super League. If Netherlands finish in 12th place or higher for the ODI Super League, they will be guaranteed to stay in the Super League for the 2027 cycle and could possibly be joined by a second Associate nation, the winner of the CWC League Two. However, if Netherlands finishes in last place in the ODI Super League, they run the risk of being replaced by another Associate country for the 2027 World Cup qualification cycle.AfghanistanIrelandBangladeshZimbabweSri LankaPakistanIndiaNew ZealandWest IndiesSouth AfricaAustraliaEnglandJerseyItalyBermudaUgandaHong KongKenyaVanuatuSingaporeQatarMalaysiaDenmarkOmanNepalScotlandNamibiaUnited Arab EmiratesPapua New GuineaCanadaNetherlandsUnited States of AmericaWorld Cup League 2Peter Della Penna is ESPNcricinfo's USA correspondent @PeterDellaPenna Matches (11) Matches (11) (11) SL v PAK (1) SL v PAK (1) (1) SA-W in ENG (1) SA-W in ENG (1) (1) County DIV1 (5) County DIV1 (5) (5) County DIV2 (3) County DIV2 (3) (3) TNPL (1) TNPL (1) (1) Live • 2nd TEST • Galle • 2nd TEST (15.1 ov) & Day 3 - Session 2: Sri Lanka lead by 206 runs.

Considered one of the greatest batsmen of all time, he ended his career with stunning figures – a total of 10,122 Test runs at an average of 51.12, including 34 centuries, and 3,092 runs in 108 ODIs at an average of 35.13. He also held the record for the most number of runs in Tests by an Indian batsman, which was finally broken by Sachin Tendulkar.

At a time when fast bowling around the world was strong and healthy, Gavaskar's technical purity and balance, his impeccable judgement of length and line, his insurmountable powers of concentration, and his range of strokeplay have all left such an indelible mark that he remains one of the foremost opening batsmen of all time. For India he was a blessing, giving the team a resilience that it had sorely lacked in the past. There had been other top-class Indian batsmen before him, but none who sustained the run-scoring excellence as relentlessly as Gavaskar did. He started his Ranji Trophy career with a fifth-ball duck against Mysore, but hundreds in each of his next three Ranji matches confirmed the potential. Even so, none would have anticipated the stunning manner in which he announced his arrival on the world stage. Picked in the squad to tour the West Indies in 1971, Gavaskar justified the move in the most emphatic manner possible, amassing 774 runs in four matches, a tally that remains a record for the most prolific series by a batsman on debut. A couple of his half-centuries helped India to their first win against West Indies, in Port-of-Spain, a venue that remained his favourite throughout his career. That kicked off an amazing sequence of scores, with centuries in each of the next two Tests, and he signed off quite majestically, scoring 124 and 220 in the last Test - again in Port-of-Spain - to become only the second batsman in Test history to score a hundred and a double in the same match. The start was almost too good to be true, and it was inevitable that those lofty standards wouldn't be sustained, even for a batsman as focused and gifted as Gavaskar: in his next 26 innings, he scored fewer runs than he had in his first eight, and managed just one century, 101 in a losing cause at Old Trafford in 1974. That brief lean spell, though, was the precursor to Gavaskar's best sustained period in international cricket: in the five years between 1975 and 1979, he averaged nearly 60 and had a fantastic rate of converting fifties into hundreds. Arguably his best innings - the 221 against England at The Oval - came during this phase. In the 10 series he played in these five years, he averaged 50 or more in eight, and over 75 in three. The next five years were considerably less successful - in 11 series during the early- and mid-1980s his average exceeded 50 only three times. This was also the period when he played his worst series - against the touring England side in 1984, Gavaskar totalled 140 runs in eight innings at a miserable average of 17.50. The clamours for his retirement grew during this period, but Gavaskar ensured that when he did leave, he did so on his own terms, averaging more than 58 in his last 16 Tests, and scoring an unforgettable 96 in his final innings. Sunil Gavaskar's Test career Period Tests Runs Average 100s/ 50s Debut series 4 774 154.80 4/ 3 July 1971 to Jan 1975 13 693 27.72 1/ 6 Feb 1975 to Jan 1980 45 4434 59.91 18/ 16 Feb 1980 to Sep 1985 47 2939 40.81 7/ 14 Oct 1985 onwards 16 1282 58.27 4/ 6 Career 125 10,122 51.12 34/ 45 Despite having played during a period when run-scoring was considerably more difficult than it is today, Gavaskar achieved some incredible numbers, becoming the first to get to 10,000 Test runs and 30 centuries. During the two decades in which he played, only six batsmen scored more than 4000 runs at a 50-plus average. Top batsmen between Jan 1970 and Dec 1989 (Qual: 4000 runs) Batsman Tests Runs Average 100s/ 50s Javed Miandad 101 7701 57.04 22/ 36 Greg Chappell 87 7110 53.86 24/ 31 Allan Border 111 8488 53.38 23/ 46 Viv Richards 108 7849 51.98 24/ 37 Sunil Gavaskar 125 10,122 51.12 34/ 45 Geoff Boycott 67 5505 50.50 16/ 29 One of the most remarkable aspects of Gavaskar's career was the success he achieved against West Indies, the best team of the 1980s. He scored 13 centuries against them, which is the second-highest for a batsman against one opposition; only Don Bradman, with 19 against England, has more. Bradman's overall rate of scoring hundreds was obviously much better than Gavaskar's, but in this case the rates were comparable: Bradman's 19 came in 37 Tests, while Gavaskar needed 27 matches for his 13 hundreds. Some of his runs against West Indies were scored when the attacks weren't quite as fearsome - in his first series, in 1970-71, West Indies had a spin-heavy attack, while in 1978-79 the best bowlers were away playing in World Series Cricket, but even in the other series Gavaskar had some memorable battles against the West Indies' fast bowlers. Fittingly, some of his most memorable landmarks came against them: in the 1983-84 series in India, he made his 29th hundred, to equal Bradman's record, and then went past it in Chennai. Both were special innings - the first one, in Delhi, came off a mere 94 balls, while the second was a marathon that lasted more than 10 hours and ended a run-drought of 36 runs from his previous five innings. Of the 2749 runs Gavaskar scored against West Indies, almost 30% came at a single venue - the Queen's Park Oval in Port-of-Spain. He played five Tests there, and only once did he fail, scoring 1 and 32 in the 1983 series. Despite that, he was the Bradman of Port-of-Spain, averaging 99.12 at the ground. He is also one of only four batsmen to score more than 750 Test runs at an overseas venue, and remains the only one to do it since 1950. Among the grounds he played in, only at two venues did he score more runs - the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai and the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai. Best batsmen against West Indies between 1970 and 1990 (Qual: 750 runs) Batsman Tests Runs Average 100s/ 50s Dennis Amiss 9 1113 74.20 4/ 2 Sunil Gavaskar 27 2749 65.45 13/ 7 Wasim Raja 11 919 57.43 2/ 7 Greg Chappell 17 1400 56.00 5/ 7 Gundappa Viswanath 18 1455 53.88 4/ 7 Ian Chappell 12 997 52.47 3/ 4 Ian Redpath 11 956 47.80 3/ 5 Geoff Boycott 17 1286 44.34 2/ 9 Dilip Vengsarkar 25 1596 44.33 6/ 7 Allan Border 21 1479 42.25 2/ 11 Opening the innings was a tough job in an era when there were plenty of top-class fast bowlers around, but Gavaskar handled the pressures superbly. Apart from the West Indies attack, he played 18 Tests against Imran Khan and 14 against Ian Botham. While both are among the five bowlers who dismissed him most often, Gavaskar had more than his fair share of success against them. He scored four centuries in the 18 Tests he played against Imran - including in each innings of the Karachi Test in 1978, and a memorable unbeaten 127, when he carried the bat through the innings against a rampant Imran in Faisalabad in 1983. (In fact, Gavaskar is one of only two batsmen to score centuries in each innings of a Test three times; Ricky Ponting is the other.) Botham dismissed him eight times, but mostly after he had made reasonable contributions. The bowler who dismissed him cheaply most often was Malcolm Marshall, who too nailed him on eight occasions, seven of them before he touched 25. Of course, the fact that Gavaskar usually faced the first ball of an innings also meant the bowlers had the opportunity to dismiss him off the first ball of the match - this fate befell him three times, with Geoff Arnold, Imran and Marshall the successful bowlers. Bangladesh's Hannan Sarkar is the only batsman to share this record with Gavaskar. Till the turn of the century Gavaskar was one of only six openers to have scored more than 3000 runs at a 50-plus average. (Three batsmen - Matthew Hayden, Graeme Smith and Virender Sehwag - have joined the club since then, which is another stat to suggest that opening the innings has become comparatively easier in the last decade.)

The two scored runs in all conditions and finished with a highly creditable average of 53.75. Of the 59 times they opened, on 20 occasions they put together a partnership of at least 50. Best opening pairs before 2000 (Qual: 2000 partnership runs) Pair Innings Runs Average p'ship 100/ 50 stands Jack Hobbs-Herbert Sutcliffe 38 3249 87.81 15/ 10 Jack Hobbs-Wilfred Rhodes 36 2146 61.31 8/ 5 Bill Lawry-Bob Simpson 62 3596 60.94 9/ 18 Len Hutton-Cyril Washbrook 51 2880 60.00 8/ 13 Michael Atherton-Graham Gooch 44 2501 56.84 7/ 12 Chetan Chauhan-Sunil Gavaskar 59 3010 53.75 10/ 10 Michael Slater-Mark Taylor 78 3887 51.14 10/ 16 Gordon Greenidge-Desmond Haynes 148 6482 47.31 16/ 26 The other aspect of Gavaskar's career that stood out was his ability to play for long periods, especially in the fourth innings of Tests. Several other top-class batsmen have performed below potential in the last innings of Tests, with Tendulkar being the prime example: in 47 such innings he averages less than 38. But Gavaskar had no such problems, averaging 58.25 in 33 innings, which is second only to Boycott among batsmen who scored at least 1000 fourth-innings runs. One of the features of Gavaskar's batting - and that of India during the period he played in - was the ability to bat many overs in the last innings. When he scored that 221 at The Oval, India batted 150.5 overs, and there were several other instances when the team batted more than 100 overs. (Click here for a Numbers Game column from July 2007 that compares Gavaskar and Tendulkar in fourth innings; while Gavaskar averaged more than 56 in meaningful fourth innings, Tendulkar only managed an average of less than 27.) Best Test averages in fourth innings (Qual: 1000 runs) Batsman Innings Runs Average 100s/ 50s Geoff Boycott 34 1234 58.76 3/ 7 Sunil Gavaskar 33 1398 58.25 4/ 8 Graeme Smith 30 1285 53.54 3/ 8 Gordon Greenidge 38 1383 53.19 3/ 6 Ricky Ponting 38 1311 52.44 4/ 4 Matthew Hayden 39 1287 49.50 1/ 9 Jacques Kallis 41 1212 44.88 1/ 10 Graham Gooch 29 1121 44.84 3/ 5 In fact, Gavaskar was at his most prolific in matches that ended in draws. In the 23 Tests he played that India won, his average was only 43.97, and he scored six hundreds. On the other hand, 22 of his 34 hundreds came in draws, and his average shot up to more than 65 in those matches. Gavaskar remains the only batsman to have scored more than 6000 runs in drawn Tests, with Tendulkar more than 400 runs short of the mark. Most runs in drawn Tests Batsman Tests Runs Average 100s/ 50s Sunil Gavaskar 67 6039 65.64 22/ 25 Sachin Tendulkar 67 5563 67.02 19/ 25 Allan Border 59 5084 68.70 16/ 27 Rahul Dravid 53 4979 68.20 16/ 26 Javed Miandad 62 4570 61.75 12/ 23 Compared to his Test exploits, Gavaskar's ODI achievements will probably remain a footnote, especially given the manner in which the game - and hence batting stats - have changed over the last decade. His unbeaten 36 in a 60-over game against England in the 1975 World Cup will probably remain his single most talked-about ODI \"exploit\", but towards the second half of his career, his ODI skills improved exponentially. In his first 52 ODIs he averaged 25.28, with only seven half-centuries; in his next 56 games, his average increased by more than 20 runs, and he also scored 21 scores of 50-plus, including his only ODI century, an outstanding 88-ball unbeaten 103 against New Zealand in the 1987 World Cup.

Of his 28 scores of 50-plus in ODIs, 19 came when India batted second. Highest ODI averages in run-chases till Dec 1989 (Qual: 1000 runs) Batsman ODIs Runs Average Strike rate 100s/ 50s Gordon Greenidge 67 2798 50.87 66.36 7/ 15 Sunil Gavaskar 53 1905 48.84 61.45 1/ 18 Viv Richards 97 2840 46.55 86.82 3/ 20 Allan Lamb 46 1558 45.82 75.12 2/ 8 Javed Miandad 66 2090 44.46 70.53 1/ 16 Apart from his considerable batting skills, Gavaskar also brought plenty to the table with his astute captaincy. He was often criticised for being too defensive, and while that criticism was probably justified at times, it needs to be remembered that the Indian bowling attack - apart from Kapil Dev - was pretty thin during that period. Only Sourav Ganguly has led India in more Tests than Gavaskar's 47, and only three captains - Ganguly, Mohammad Azharuddin and MS Dhoni - have led them to more wins than Gavaskar's nine. In ODIs, his win percentage as captain was only 27.57 (14 wins in 37 matches) but that also included India's most accomplished performance on the world stage, when they crushed all opposition on the way to a famous triumph at the World Championship of Cricket in Australia in 1985. Add all those achievements up, and it's easy to see why Sunil Gavaskar is easily one of the greatest cricketers the game has seen.

On the other hand, 22 of his 34 hundreds came in draws, and his average shot up to more than 65 in those matches. Gavaskar remains the only batsman to have scored more than 6000 runs in drawn Tests, with Tendulkar more than 400 runs short of the mark.

His unbeaten 36 in a 60-over game against England in the 1975 World Cup will probably remain his single most talked-about ODI \"exploit\", but towards the second half of his career, his ODI skills improved exponentially. In his first 52 ODIs he averaged 25.28, with only seven half-centuries; in his next 56 games, his average increased by more than 20 runs, and he also scored 21 scores of 50-plus, including his only ODI century, an outstanding 88-ball unbeaten 103 against New Zealand in the 1987 World Cup.

Of his 28 scores of 50-plus in ODIs, 19 came when India batted second.

He was often criticised for being too defensive, and while that criticism was probably justified at times, it needs to be remembered that the Indian bowling attack - apart from Kapil Dev - was pretty thin during that period. Only Sourav Ganguly has led India in more Tests than Gavaskar's 47, and only three captains - Ganguly, Mohammad Azharuddin and MS Dhoni - have led them to more wins than Gavaskar's nine. In ODIs, his win percentage as captain was only 27.57 (14 wins in 37 matches) but that also included India's most accomplished performance on the world stage, when they crushed all opposition on the way to a famous triumph at the World Championship of Cricket in Australia in 1985. Add all those achievements up, and it's easy to see why Sunil Gavaskar is easily one of the greatest cricketers the game has seen. S Rajesh is stats editor of Cricinfo © ESPN Sports Media Ltd.

", "It was in his 52nd Test match that Virat Kohli’s average first touched the lofty 50s. Since then, it had never plunged below the gold standard of elite Test-match batsmanship. But he needed to get 43 runs in the Bangalore innings to ensure his average, which was earlier 50.35, did not drop below 50 for the first time in 49 Tests. It’s now been 18 Tests without a century for Kohli, who followed his 23 in the first innings with a 13 in the second of the Bengaluru match, the second of the two-match Test series. After his dismissal on Sunday, Kohli’s average stands at 49.95. At his peak, he touched 55.1 and looked set for an upward curve, before it came crashing down. Since his summit, which he achieved when racking up his highest Test score of 254 not out against South Africa, he has averaged only a fraction above 30. A casualty of the dip has been, naturally, his average. Though Kohli himself has made less fuss about numbers and put more emphasis on the impact of those knocks, a sub-50 average would dilute his credentials to be among the finest batsmen of all-time. The greats, despite their occasional lean patches, have always maintained a career average of 50. Sunil Gavaskar’s has never dropped from the 50s since his Test debut. Once their average crossed 50, Sachin Tendulkar (despite an arid last phase) and Rahul Dravid never let it plummet below this benchmark. Kohli would care less about numbers, or his eventual place in the history of India’s batting greats. He is already a legend, won more matches than most, led India to record number of wins, but whether he is one of the greatest of all time or one of the greats of his time would depend on that average. It could well determine whether he ends up in the bracket of Alastair Cook and David Warner (mighty good batsmen but not in the G.O.A.T list) or that of Dravid and Tendulkar. He’s certainly in the latter class, in terms of his quality and mastery of conditions, but a sub-50 average would disfigure his aura. 📣 Join our Telegram channel (The Indian Express) for the latest news and updates For all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App. Sandip G... read more Follow Us: Tuesday, July 26, 2022 Subscribe For the first time in 49 Tests, Kohli's Test average drops below 50 Updated: March 13, 2022 6:37:51 pm India's Virat Kohli bats during the first test match between India and Sri Lanka in Mohali, India, Friday, March 4, 2022.

Peter Roebuck in Gavaskar: Portrait Of A Hero, to show just how good Sunil Gavaskar was as a batsman tells a story that former Pakistan captain Rameez Raja never tires of telling. Rameez was standing at forward short leg to Gavaskar in a Test match during the 1987 series. The bowler was his captain Imran Khan, a fierce and uncompromising competitor. As the batsman settled into his immaculate stance, Imran steamed in and from his high-leap action bowled a late outswinger which the batsman, going back and across, let go, bat drawn out of harm’s way at the last moment, eyes following the ball right into the wicket keeper’s gloves. “Dekho aur seekho opening batting kaise karte hain (watch and learn how an opener should bat)’’, Rameez recalls Imran hollering at him in his follow through. “Instead of trying to unsettle Gavaskar, he was sledging me instead,’’ says Rameez with a laugh. Getting Gavaskar out, of course, was no laughing matter. Over an 18-year career, he blunted the best bowling attacks in the world, in all kinds of conditions, pitches and situations, scoring runs with a regularity and authority that finds few parallels in the history of the game. Imran’s admiration of Gavaskar could not be shackled by the niggardly tu-tu-main-main that frequently defines Indo-Pak cricket. In his own career, which too started in 1971 (like the Indian opening batsman), Imran had seen and played against the best in the world. To him, Gavaskar was distinct, and for good reason. Between 1978 and 1987, in 24 Tests, Gavaskar would score over 2,089 runs against Pakistan alone, the last 96 of these coming in his final innings at Bangalore. That India lost the match by a mere 17 runs did not take away from his supreme effort, only added to the pathos. On a dust bowl, where the ball spun, broke and bounced viciously and unpredictably, he played an innings of such technical certitude and tenacity of purpose that Imran called it then the greatest innings he had seen. It’s been almost three decades since, but I doubt he has had a change of mind. Prior to the Bangalore Test, Gavaskar had gone past 10,000 Test runs, the first man to do so. Shortly after this series, he played in the MCC Bicentennial match where he made 188, never having scored a century at Lord’s earlier. In the World Cup later that year, in his last but one appearance in international cricket, he scored his maiden century in one-day cricket—and the fastest by an Indian batsman till then. He was 38. The final flourish was to match his first, providing appropriate closure to a magnificent career. There was tumult in Indian cricket when Gavaskar was picked for his first series, against the West Indies in 1970-71. The then chairman of selectors Vijay Merchant had set the cat among the pigeons. One major move of his was to dislodge long-standing captain Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi (with his casting vote), the other was to infuse young blood into an ageing side with the credo, “Catch them young”. Himself an opening batsman from the ‘Bombay School’, Merchant saw the potential in Gavaskar’s batsmanship in school, university and domestic first-class cricket which the skeptics missed: he’s in the team because of his uncle former India wicket-keeper Madhav Mantri’s influence, they argued. In four Tests (having missed the opening one) Gavaskar shut the critics up. Forever. He scored 774 runs, a record aggregate for a debut series, which has still to be bettered. His career thereafter was to afford a mountainous litany of achievements that would keep statisticians and historians occupied full time. Sample this: Gavaskar is still the only Indian batsman to have scored more than 700 runs in a Test series. He did this twice, both times against the West Indies. He broke Sir Donald Bradman’s record of 29 Test centuries. His average never dipped below 50. He was the first man to score 10,000 Test runs. When he finished his 125-Test career, he had scored more runs (10,122) and scored more centuries (34) than any man in cricket history. Barring the first mentioned, all other records have been bettered or equalled. In time, even the remaining one will go. But that will not diminish Gavaskar’s influence on Indian cricket even a whit—as batsman and cricketing persona. His contribution at the top was significant in shaping the fortunes of the team in the 1970s and 1980s. India had struggled for quality opening batsmen (as indeed effective opening bowlers) after Merchant and Mushtaq Ali had emerged as a durable and productive duo, alas all too briefly. While the world record first wicket partnership stood in the name of Pankaj Roy and Vinoo Mankad (413 v New Zealand in 1955) for a long while, the weakness of Indian batsmen against the new ball, and particularly playing overseas, was often a source of embarrassment. In1952 against England at Headingley, the scoreline at one stage read 0-4! Gavaskar filled up this void, often single-handedly, with amazing durability. His batsmanship was built around superb technique, great powers of concentration, grit and determination in adverse situations and a hunger for success that was barely camouflaged. In his pomp, he was easily the most ‘complete’ batsman in the world if not the most entertaining. His approach was highly nuanced, making minor technical adjustments depending on the pitch and opposing bowlers, the fundamental tactic being to wear down the opposition in the sure belief that runs would inevitably follow. Since he lacked nothing in range of strokes, and could swiftly move into an attacking mode as he showed in his last few seasons, Gavaskar’s tempered approach could be attributed to three things: the way batsmen (save those from the Caribbean) were mentored in those days, the onus of carrying the team’s batting on his shoulders. And, of course, in the best tradition of the Bombay school, he hated to get out! The genius in his batsmanship was built around determination and discipline to excel. A sharp mind helped him analyse match situations quicker than most; an elephant’s memory made him never forget anything, specially mistakes he may have made. Net practice was as serious business as playing in a match. He would spend long and hard hours ironing out even the smallest of flaws in his batting technique. He was his own best friend and worst critic in these matters, unsparing of effort, ruthlessly casting aside any temptation to take it easy. Some of this is evident in the discipline he still carries as a media person, which he became as soon as he retired. He writes his own columns, untrusting of ‘ghosts’, is never late for any assignment and hardly ever shows that he is worse for travel or burden of work. The runs and centuries he scored obviously gave the team sustenance, but more importantly, Gavaskar ushered in self-belief . Prior to his arrival, India had plenty of talent, but also plenty of pusillanimity. The urge to compete was often overridden by the mere fact of playing, which in many ways was a way of acknowledging that other teams and players were better. Gavaskar defied this syndrome. He played with a deep sense of pride that sought to overturn such complex. In doing this, he was often prickly, but over a period of time, he gave Indian cricket spine which got to be universally acknowledged. In 1979, when he made 221 in a valiant effort to chase down 419 runs in the fourth innings at the Oval, the team failing by a mere nine runs, he was hailed as the Little Master and clubbed alongside Sir Jack Hobbs and Sir Len Hutton as the best opening batsman in the game. From the mid-1970s through the 1980s, Gavaskar was the most towering influence in Indian cricket. The late cricket writer K.N. Prabhu says in a piece in India 50, The Making of A Nation, that while Prime Minister Indira Gandhi’s writ ran supreme at the Centre, Gavaskar’s word was unchallenged in Indian cricket. He was unafraid to take up cudgels on behalf of players on the issue of wages, or of increased workload. As captain, he picked players who he thought would deliver the best results for him. A scheduled tour of the West Indies in 1980 was called off when Gavaskar said he was too tired to play. The mid-1970s was a rebellious phase in India with anger against national politics (this was the time of the Emergency) finding expression in cinema and cricket, India’s two abiding passions. This was the time when Amitabh Bachchan rose to eminence as the Angry Young Man on celluloid, and Gavaskar ceaselessly questioned cricket authority and niceties. Becoming such a potent power centre also showed up in some unedifying aspects in his cricket. In the 1975 World Cup, he batted 60 overs to score 36 runs, the ignominious crawl earning him wide opprobrium. In 1980-81, he almost conceded a Test against Australia when staging a walkout with partner Chetan Chauhan after being sledged by opponents when he questioned the umpire about his dismissal. Fortunately, Chauhan was prevented from leaving the field, and India went on to win the Test and square the series. The 1980s were also replete with stories of internecine problems in the Indian dressing room, several of which featured Gavaskar prominently. His `clash’ with Kapil Dev, when the Indian captaincy was alternating between the two, necessitated the then BCCI president to intervene and ask them to smoke a peace pipe. Often, he was (and still is) termed moody, mercenary and mercurial: to wit, self-centred. But these episodes and epithets are in a sense symptomatic of virtuoso performers: they emphasise the complexity of his personality but do not belittle his magnificent legacy to Indian cricket. If Virat Kohli proclaims Sachin Tendulkar as the source of his inspiration, and Tendulkar cites Gavaskar as the fount of his, the present and the past merge seamlessly.

Sourav Ganguly's ability to polarise opinion led to one of the most fascinating dramas in Indian cricket. Yet, nobody can dispute that he was India's most successful Test captain - forging a winning unit from a bunch of talented, but directionless, individuals - and nobody can argue about him being one of the greatest one-day batsmen of all time. Despite being a batsman who combined grace with surgical precision in his strokeplay, his career had spluttered to a standstill before being resurrected by a scintillating hundred on debut at Lord's in 1996. Later that year, he was promoted to the top of the order in ODIs and, along with Sachin Tendulkar, formed one of the most destructive opening pairs in history. When he took over the captaincy after the match-fixing exposes in 2000, he quickly proved to be a tough, intuitive and uncompromising leader. Under his stewardship India started winning Test matches away, and put together a splendid streak that took them all the way to the World Cup final in 2003. Later that year, in Australia, an unexpected and incandescent hundred at Brisbane set the tone for the series where India fought the world's best team to a standstill. Victory in Pakistan turned him into a cult figure but instead of being a springboard for greater things, it was the peak of a slippery slope. The beginning of the end came in 2004 at Nagpur - when his last-minute withdrawal played a part in Australia clinching the series - and things went pear shaped when his loss of personal form coincided with India's insipid ODI performances. Breaking point was reached when his differences with Greg Chappell leaked into public domain and his career was in jeopardy when India began their remarkable revival under Rahul Dravid. His gritty 30s at Karachi, when India succumbed to a humiliating defeat in early 2006, weren't enough for him to retain his spot and some felt he would never get another chance. Others, as always, thought otherwise and they were proved right when he was included in the Test squad for the away series in South Africa in 2006-2007. He ended as the highest Indian run-scorer in that series and capped his fairytale comeback with four half-centuries on his return to ODIs. He continued his fine run in England, where he finished as the second highest scorer in Tests, and went on to slam back-to-back hundreds against Pakistan at home, the second of which was a glorious 239 in Bangalore. Ganguly was surprisingly omitted from India's ODI squad for the CB Series in Australia and has been out of contention in the one-day squad since. After a poor Test series in Sri Lanka, there were reports of him considering retirement but he was given a lifeline in the Tests against Australia at home. Two days before the first Test, he said the series would be his last.

Snehasish C Ganguly Batting | Bowling | Career statistics | Profile | Timeline | Best Performances | Cricinfo Picks | Latest Articles | Photos+ | Latest Photos Some felt he couldn't play the bouncer, others swore that he was God on the off-side; some laughed at his lack of athleticism, others took immense pride in his ability to galvanise a side. Sourav Ganguly's ability to polarise opinion led to one of the most fascinating dramas in Indian cricket. Yet, nobody can dispute that he was India's most successful Test captain - forging a winning unit from a bunch of talented, but directionless, individuals - and nobody can argue about him being one of the greatest one-day batsmen of all time. Despite being a batsman who combined grace with surgical precision in his strokeplay, his career had spluttered to a standstill before being resurrected by a scintillating hundred on debut at Lord's in 1996. Later that year, he was promoted to the top of the order in ODIs and, along with Sachin Tendulkar, formed one of the most destructive opening pairs in history. When he took over the captaincy after the match-fixing exposes in 2000, he quickly proved to be a tough, intuitive and uncompromising leader. Under his stewardship India started winning Test matches away, and put together a splendid streak that took them all the way to the World Cup final in 2003. Later that year, in Australia, an unexpected and incandescent hundred at Brisbane set the tone for the series where India fought the world's best team to a standstill. Victory in Pakistan turned him into a cult figure but instead of being a springboard for greater things, it was the peak of a slippery slope. The beginning of the end came in 2004 at Nagpur - when his last-minute withdrawal played a part in Australia clinching the series - and things went pear shaped when his loss of personal form coincided with India's insipid ODI performances.

He has got to this point coming from the cricketing backwaters, the mining state of Jharkhand, and through a home-made batting and wicketkeeping technique, and a style of captaincy that scales the highs and lows of both conservatism and unorthodoxy. Under Dhoni's captaincy, India have won the top prize in all formats: topping the Test rankings for 18 months starting December 2009, the 50-over World Cup in 2011 and the World T20 on his captaincy debut in 2007. Dhoni, then a ticket inspector with the Indian Railways, had escaped all attention bar the odd whisper among the followers of club cricket in Kolkata until he was 23, when he blasted two centuries in a triangular 50-over tournament for India A in Nairobi. Long-haired and fearless, he soon swaggered into international cricket, and became an instant darling of the crowds with ODI innings of 148 and 183 within a year of his debut. Dhoni demonstrated all that was right with the new middle-class India. He didn't respect reputations, but never disrespected either. He improvised, he learned, but didn't apologise for his batting style, which was not the most elegant. He became a multi-faceted ODI batsman, one who could accumulate, one who could rebuild, and one who could still unleash those big sixes. Along the way Dhoni showed leadership skills, which were recognised when Rahul Dravid gave up the captaincy in 2007. Just before that announcement from Dravid, Dhoni had taken a bunch of kids to South Africa and was leading India to a World Cup win in a format the country didn't even take seriously. The ODI captaincy was natural progression, and Anil Kumble just kept the seat warm in Tests for a year. Dhoni brought to captaincy a thick skin and relative indifference to results that an Indian captain needs to keep the job for long. Along with coach Gary Kirsten, he put his senior performers in a comfortable place, and they returned the favour with some of their best years in international cricket. His calmness on the field helped and worked like a charm in the shorter formats, although tactically he sometimes sat back for too long in Tests. All that can't argue with the fact that India had some of their best years in Test cricket, in terms of tangible achievement, under Dhoni. However, post the 50-over World Cup win in 2011, which Dhoni sealed with a timely 91 and his patented helicopter shot, an ageing team kept losing in unfamiliar conditions. After eight straight Test losses away from home, Dhoni the captain came under immense pressure, which was accentuated by a 2-1 home series loss to England in 2012-13, the first time India had lost at home in more than eight years. This brought out a new chapter in Dhoni's career wherein he seemed more assertive as a captain, started building a new team, played his best Test innings on a turner to win India the Chennai Test against Australia, and became the first captain to lead India to four wins in a series. Away from home in the winter of 2013-14, India lost Test series in South Africa and New Zealand by 1-0 margins that did not reflect how close they came close to wins on both tours. The England tour of 2014 began promisingly, with a drawn first Test followed by a historic win at Lord's, but India crashed to earth immediately afterwards to lose the series 3-1. At Old Trafford and The Oval, with the batting crumbling around him, Dhoni played a couple of his bravest innings in Tests, dealing with the seam movement and bounce by stepping down the pitch and taking blows on his body. Wins once again proved elusive on the tour of Australia that followed, though India competed ferociously thanks to a young batting core led by Kohli. Kohli had captained the side in the first Test, with Dhoni injured, and he would lead them in the fourth Test too, with Dhoni making a surprise announcement after the third Test in Melbourne that he was retiring from the longest format. Though his game was not as suited to Tests as it was to limited-overs cricket, Dhoni ended his career in whites with a proud record for a wicketkeeper: 4876 runs at an average of just over 38, and six hundreds. He had also captained India to more Test wins - 27 - than anyone else. Dhoni continued to lead India in the shorter formats, and they shrugged off a win-less tour of Australia by reaching the semi-finals of the 2015 World Cup. A year later, they won the Asia Cup T20 in Bangladesh but exited the World T20 in the semi-finals, at home. Dhoni enjoyed a good tournament as a finisher, scoring 89 runs while only being dismissed once in five innings; he showed electric reflexes while keeping to the spinners, eventually playing on till the 2019 World Cup, though he gave up the limited-overs captaincy in January 2017. India's defeat to New Zealand in the semi-final of the 2019 World Cup turned out to be Dhoni's final international match, although that wasn't officially confirmed till more than a year later. In the immediate aftermath of that result, there was lots of speculation about whether Dhoni would call it quits. He didn't, but he did opt out of India's series for the rest of 2019 and early 2020. The Covid-19 pandemic then brought all sporting action to a halt. Just as players' preparations for the delayed IPL began, in August, on India's Independence Day, Dhoni made the big announcement - on Instagram. He was retiring from all international cricket. In the IPL, Dhoni has been the face of the Chennai Super Kings franchise. He became so deeply associated with the city that he even became a co-owner of a Chennai-based football franchise. But in 2016, with Super Kings suspended for two seasons over issues stemming from the spot-fixing scandal of 2013, he was part of the IPL's new franchise Rising Pune Supergiants. Super Kings were reinstated in 2018 and Dhoni was back at the helm, leading the team to a fairytale third title. He almost repeated the feat in 2019, losing a thrilling final against Mumbai Indians by just 1 run.Sidharth Monga Jul 7, 2022 Fans celebrate MS Dhoni's 41st birthday at the TNPL in Dindigul © TNPL May 20, 2022 Yuzvendra Chahal sent MS Dhoni on his way for a 28-ball 26 © BCCI May 20, 2022 MS Dhoni reacts in the field © BCCI ICC One-Day Player of the Year 2008 ICC One-Day Player of the Year 2009 ICC Spirit of Cricket Award 2011 LG People's Choice Award 2013 To help make this website better, to improve and personalize your experience and for advertising purposes, are you happy to accept cookies and other technologies.

DHONI POWER Mahendra Singh Dhoni is the latest poster boy of Indian Cricket When the Indian cricket team arrived in Bangalore recently it was the man from Jharkhand - Mahendra Singh Dhoni who grabbed all the attention with the press pack hounding him. The televisions didn't get their soundbytes though, because the man has a contract with one news channel, which gets exclusive access to him. This meant the print media got Dhoni all for themselves — a rare privilege at a time when celebrities are hard to get if you don't wield a television camera! So, what does he think about India agreeing to the 20-20 cricket concept? \"Aap starting hi karo controversy hatake. 20-20 math pucho yaar,\" Dhoni replied, making it clear this conversation was going to have some very clearly defined boundaries. But after persisting he said \"Everything goes. Test match bhi, one dayers and even 20-20. It is an interesting concept and is good for the spectators.\" Over the last season, due to his exploits with the bat, Dhoni has emerged the latest poster boy of Indian cricket. This even led to him being crowned the MTV Youth Icon of 2006. \"I think it is a prestigious award. The youth are the ones who poll and decide who is the icon,\" he reflected. \"Most others (contestants) were from different fields, and that's where I feel cricket played a role in me winning the award. But it was also about how you are off the field. Cricket is not everything, it is not life. The person you are off the field and how you behave with others matter. You have to be a good human being and that is a challenge, a tough challenge.\" Recently an advertisement has featured Dhoni driving a bike and it has now emerged that the man is a hardcore bike enthusiast. Rumours have it that he has laid his hands on a Suzuki Hayabusa, the most powerful bike in the world. But Dhoni said the truth is far from it. \"No, I haven't got a Hayabusa. I have a Kawasaki ZX 14. But I like dirt biking the most. So, TVS is building a customised dirt bike for me because one is not available in the market. This has been kept confidential till now.\" Another face of Dhoni not many know about is a passion he shares with Ronaldinho — their love for gaming. While playing too much on a playstation is being cited as a reason for the Brazilian's poor performance at the world cup, Dhoni made his priorities very clear. \"Off the field it is one of the things I do most of the time. But I like to play only if I get a stretch of two to three hours. I don't like to leave the game in the middle, go for a training session and then come back.\" Dhoni will also feature in a computer game, the next edition of Brian Lara Cricket. But he said he much prefers cricket in real life. \"I am into basically first person-shooting games. Counter Strike, Black Hawk Down, Men Of Valour...\" Talk over the last few weeks has been of the much-vaunted cricket reality show. It aims to discover talent from across India, which according to Dhoni will be a long process. \"I think it should work. It depends on what their plan is. It remains to be seen how they will explore rural and urban areas. It also depends on how the plan is executed. It is a stage-by-stage process.\" Dhoni must come across as the stuff of nightmares to bowlers, but in person, he is far from that image. He says he believes in being positive and controlling his aggression. \"There are times when it is really hard to control yourself but you have to. Because it's cricket, not boxing.\" Comparisons have been made to Aussie hero Adam Gilchrist. Though the two players are worlds apart, Dhoni does seem to have some of that Aussie grit and aggression in him. \"That's a real hard thing to judge. I haven't judged myself. But one thing is for sure, wherever I am part of — cricket, soccer or any other game — I am serious. I give 100 per cent. I may succeed or lose.

K. DHONI POWER Mahendra Singh Dhoni is the latest poster boy of Indian Cricket When the Indian cricket team arrived in Bangalore recently it was the man from Jharkhand - Mahendra Singh Dhoni who grabbed all the attention with the press pack hounding him. The televisions didn't get their soundbytes though, because the man has a contract with one news channel, which gets exclusive access to him. This meant the print media got Dhoni all for themselves — a rare privilege at a time when celebrities are hard to get if you don't wield a television camera!

शैली", "content": "धोनी एक आक्रामक सीधे हाथ के बल्लेबाज और विकेट-कीपर है। धोनी उन विकेटकीपरों में से एक है जिन्होंने जूनियर व भारत के ए क्रिकेट टीम से चलकर राष्ट्रीय दल में प्रतिनिधित्व किया। पार्थिव पटेल,अजय रातरा और दिनेश कार्तिक उन्हीं के दिखाए हुए रास्ते पे चले। धोनी जो अपने दोस्तों में माही के नाम से जाने जाते है। बिहार क्रिकेट टीम में १९९८/९९ के दौरान अपना योगदान दिया और भारत-ए टीम के लिए २००४ में हुए केन्या दौरे का प्रतिनिधित्व करने के लिए चयनित हुए। त्रिदेशीय श्रृंखला में पाकिस्तान-ए टीम के खिलाफ धोनी ने गौतम गंभीर के साथ मिलकर कई शतक बनाये और उस साल के अंत में भारतीय राष्ट्रीय टीम में चयनित हुए।\n\nधोनी ज्यादातर बैकफ़ुट में खेलने के लिए और मज़बूत बॉटम हैण्ड ग्रिप होने के वजह से जाने जाते है, वे बहुत तेज़ गति से बल्ला चलाते है, जिसके कारण गेंद अक्सर मैदान छोड़ जाती है। उनके प्रारम्भिक मुद्रा में ज्यादा संचार नहीं दिखती जैसे गेंद का पीछा करना ,उनके शैली में गेंद का पिच में न आना और इनसाइड एजिंग ज्यादा दिखती है।\n\n२००५ में अपने पाँचवे एक दिवसीय मैचमें पाकिस्‍तान के खिलाफ धोनी ने १४८ रनों की जबर्दस्त पारी खेली थी। ये किसी भारतीय विकेट-कीपर के द्वारा बनाया गया सर्वोच्च स्कोर है। उस साल के अंत में श्रीलंका के खिलाफ नाबाद १८३* रन बनाकर उसने ना सिर्फ़ ख़ुद का बनाया रिकॉर्ड तोड़ा बल्कि एक दिवसीय मैचों की दूसरी पारी में बनने वाला अब तक का सबसे बड़ा रिकॉर्ड भी कायम किया था। सीमित ओवरों के प्रारूप में धोनी की सफलता ने उनका स्थान भारतीय टेस्ट टीम में पक्‍का कर दिया और २००५/०६ के अंत में हुए एक दिवसीय क्रिकेट में अपने अनुकूल प्रदर्शन से धोनी को आईसीसी एक दिवसीय रेटिंग में नम्बर १ बल्लेबाज के रूप में स्‍थापित किया।\n\nइसके बाद धोनी का फॉर्म गिरता रहा जब २००६ में भारत आईसीसी चैम्पियन ट्राफी, डीएलऍफ़ कप और द्विपक्षीय श्रृंखला में वेस्ट इंडीज एवं दक्षिणी अफ्रीका के खिलाफ मैच हार गया। २००७ की शुरुआत में दक्षिणी अफ्रीका एवं वेस्ट इंडीज़ के खिलाफ धोनी के फॉर्म में वापस आने की बात तब ग़लत साबित हो गई जब भारत २००७ क्रिकेट विश्व कप में पहले ही राउंड में बाहर हो गया। वर्ल्ड कप के बाद धोनी ने द्विपक्षीय एकदिवसीय टूर्नामेंट में बंगलादेश के खिलाफ मैन ऑफ़ द सीरीज़ का खिताब जीता। फिर २००७ में इंग्लैंड दौरे के लिए धोनी को एक दिवसीय टीम का उप-कप्तान बनाया गया।\n\nअच्छे बल्लेबाज़ के रूप में धोनी ने अपनी लड़ाकू शैली को नियंत्रण करने की समझदारी दिखाई और जिम्मेदार पारियां खेली। अपनी चिरपरिचित शैली को छोड़ धोनी ने दो अनोखे और असरदार क्रिकेट स्ट्रोक अपनाए। भारतीय क्रिकेट टीम में अपने प्रवेश से आज तक, धोनी की आक्रामक बल्लेबाजी की शैली, क्षेत्र पर सफलता, व्यक्तित्व और लंबे बालों ने उसे भारत में सबसे ज्यादा लोकप्रिय खिलाड़ी बना दिया।", "references": []}, {"title": "घरेलू कैरियर", "content": "जूनियर क्रिकेट धोनी को १९९८/९९ में बिहार अंडर-१९ में शामिल किया गया था जिसमें इन्होंने ५ मैचों (७ पारियों) में कुल १७६ रन बनाये, पर टीम छह के समूह में चौथे स्थान पर आई थी इसलिए क्वार्टर फाइनल तक नहीं आ पाई। धोनी को पूर्वी क्षेत्र अंडर-१९ दस्ते (सीके नायडू ट्रॉफी) और बाकी भारतीय दस्ते (एम ए चिदम्बरम ट्रॉफी और वीनू मांकड़ ट्रॉफी) के लिए नहीं चुना गया था। बिहार अंडर-१९ क्रिकेट टीम १९९९—२००० के फाइनल में पहुँची जहां धोनी ने बिहार के लिए ८४ रन बनाए थे जबकि टीम ने कुल ३५७ रन बनाए थे। जबकि पंजाब अंडर-१९ टीम ने कुल ८३९ रन बनाए जिसमें युवराज सिंह ने ३५८ रन बनाए थे युवराज सिंह आगे चलकर धोनी के राष्ट्रीय स्तर पर सहयोगी बने। यूवी के ३५८ रनों के सामने धोनी का स्कोर छोटा पड़ गया। पूरे टूर्नामेंट में धोनी ने ९ मैचों में १२ पारियों में कुल ५ अर्द्धशतक ,१७ कैच और ७ स्टम्पिंग भी किये। उन्होंने 1999 -2000 सीज़न के दौरान बिहार क्रिकेट टीम के लिए रणजी ट्रॉफी की शुरुआत की और दूसरी पारी में नाबाद 68 रन बनाये। उन्होंने अगले सीजन में बंगाल के खिलाफ एक खेल के दौरान अपनी पहली प्रथम श्रेणी की शताब्दी बनाई, लेकिन उनकी टीम ने खेल खो दिया। इसके बाद सी के नायडू ट्रॉफी के लिए खेले गए ईस्ट जॉन अंडर-१९ मुकाबले में हिस्सा लिया लेकिन वे चार मैचों में केवल ९७ रन ही बना पाए थे जिसके कारण ईस्ट जॉन ने चारों मैचों में हार का सामना करके टूर्नामेंट में अंतिम स्थान प्राप्त किया। बिहार टीम धोनी जब १८ साल के थे तब १९९९/२००० में इन्होंने बिहार के लिए रणजी ट्रॉफी से अपने कैरियर की शुरुआत की थी। वह अपनी पहली मैच में असम टीम के खिलाफ दूसरी पारी में ६८ रनों की लाजवाब पारी खेली थी। धोनी ने ५ मैचों में २८३ रनों के साथ वो सीजन खत्म किया था। बाद में धोनी ने २०००/०१ के सीजन में बंगाल के खिलाफ अपना पहला प्रथम श्रेणी शतक लगाया। इसके आलावा २०००/०१ सीज़न में धोनी किसी भी मैच में अर्द्धशतक नहीं बना पाये थे। इसके बाद २००२/०३ के सीज़न में धोनी ने चार रणजी मैच में पांच अर्धशतक बनाए और देवधर ट्रॉफी के अर्न्तगत दो अर्धशतक बनाए, तत्पश्चात उन्हें निचले क्रम के योगदान में अच्छी छवि बनने लगी। २००३/०४ के सीज़न में असम के खिलाफ रणजी ट्रॉफी के पहला एक दिवसीय ट्रॉफी में धोनी ने नाबाद १२८ रन बनाए। वे ईस्ट ज़ोन के अर्न्तगत खेले और उस साल की देवधर ट्रॉफी में उन्होंने चार मैचों में कुल २४४ रन बनाए। दिलीप ट्रॉफी के फाइनल मैच में धोनी को क्रिकेटर दीप दास गुप्ता के जगह ईस्ट जॉन का प्रतिनिधित्व करने के लिए चुना गया और उन्होंने उस मैच के दूसरी पारी में में एक आक्रामक अर्द्धशतक लगाया था। भारतीय टीम २००३/०४ के सीज़न में उनके कड़े प्रयास के कारण धोनी को पहचान मिली, खास कर वनडे मैच में उन्हें जिम्बाब्वे व केन्या के लिए भारत ए टीम में चुने गए। हरारे स्पोर्ट्स क्लब में जिम्बाब्वे इलेवन के खिलाफ धोनी ने ७ कैच और ४ स्टमपिंग किये और अपने विकेट-कीपर होने का हुनर दिखाया। त्रिकोणीय टूर्नामेंट के अर्न्तगत केन्या, भारत ए और पाकिस्तान ए ने भाग लिया जिसमें धोनी ने पाकिस्तान के २२३ रनों का पीछा कर उस मैच में अर्धशतक बनाया और भारत को जीत प्राप्त करने में सहायता की। अपने प्रदर्शन को और मज़बूत करते हुए इन्होंने इसी टूर्नामेंट में १२० व ११९ रन बना कर दो शतक पूरे किए। धोनी ने कुल ७ मैचों में ३६२ रन बनाए जिसमें उनका औसत ७२.४० रहा और इस श्रृंखला में दूसरों के बीच उसके प्रदर्शन पर उस समय के कप्तान सौरव गांगुली का ध्यान गया। तथापि, भारत 'ए' टीम के कोच संदीप मधुसूदन पाटिल ने विकेट-कीपर और बल्लेबाज के रूप में भारतीय क्रिकेट टीम में जगह के लिए धोनी की सिफारिश की।", "references": ["Birthday: July 7, 1981 (Cancer) Born In: Ranchi, Jharkhand, India M.

The man being pestered the most was Daljit Singh, the groundsman. He insisted that it would turn out to be a good batting strip, with only the first session posing a few problems: \"You need a lot of discipline to get through the initial few overs. Once you get past that, there are runs to be scored.\" He spoke about the Ranji Trophy match between Punjab and Andhra earlier this season, where Andhra were gunned down for a paltry 30 on the first morning. \"The conditions were overcast, but the batsmen played a few irresponsible shots. In fact four of them were bowled.\" He compared it to an earlier match, when Punjab played Delhi: \"Delhi were struggling at 37 for 4, before Mithun [Manhas] played a beautiful innings. He played shots all round the wicket.\" And there was a smile on Daljit's face when Aakash Chopra and Gautam Gambhir negotiated the first half-hour carefully - he reiterated his point about \"applying oneself\". Of course, the Test between India and New Zealand here turned out to be a dull affair, with the surface being completely lifeless. \"Please don't talk about the Test match,\" he said, and signed off with a smile.* * * * *There were more interesting developments before the match began. Yuvraj Singh, who wasn't part of the 15 that North Zone announced yesterday, was parachuted into the playing XI. Yuvraj had missed North Zone's previous game, citing a shoulder injury, and the local media had criticised him for attending an advertisement campaign during that period. Pankaj Dharmani was the one to lose out today, and Yuvraj entertained the sparse crowd with some flourishing strokes on his way to a splendid century. East Zone also threw up a surprise. MS Dhoni was preferred to Deep Dasgupta as wicketkeeper. It's strange that the man the national selectors thought was the second-choice keeper for the Test team, and who was fit for practice yesterday, couldn't find a place in his zonal team.* * * * *The Under-19 World Cup has been the flavour of the month, and there was an interesting moment in the first session that added to this. Laxmi Ratan Shukla began his first spell, Amit Bhandari was doing some limbering-up exercises near the boundary, and Yuvraj Singh indulged in a spot of shadow practice as he awaited his turn to bat. It just needed one glance around the ground to capture all three at the same time - all names that one first heard of during previous Under-19 World Cups. Today, their careers stand at different points. Shukla, touted as the next Test allrounder, faded away after a few international appearances. Bhandari has been on the fringes for a few years, and is now just one step away from clinching a permanent place.

Patil, speaking to Wisden Cricinfo from his Shivaji Park residence in Mumbai, believes that Karthik would make an ideal No. 6 for both Tests and one-dayers. But that's not all: Patil also unearths a medium-pacer who takes five-fors on flat decks, and an opener who scores big: Sandeep Patil: 'I will be proved right about Karthik' © Getty Images How would you compare Karthik and Dhoni? I feel Dinesh Karthik is an ideal No. 6 batsman for Tests and one-dayers, and he is in the mould of Adam Gilchrist, Moin Khan and Romesh Kaluwitharana - who can win a match on his own. I can't say the same thing about the other Indian wicketkeepers in the recent past. If Karthik is given the same number of chances as Parthiv Patel, I will be proved right. I recommended Karthik to the selectors, but it was a very close call. Dhoni is also a safe wicketkeeper, and Dhoni produced two brilliant hundreds. Geoffrey Boycott wasn't impressed with Dhoni in the training camp at Bangalore, but I told him not to get discouraged since his style was unique.Sairaj Bahutule was the star performer. But where do you see his career going from here on? He is dead serious to play for India. In fact, he told me that \"I will definitely play for India now.\" He led Mumbai last season, and suddenly he has taken the step that he has to do something extra to replace Anil Kumble. He got a chance when Kumble was injured - now he wants to replace Kumble when he is bowling well.Who were the other players to catch your eye? The two surprise packages of the tour were Dhoni and Dheeraj Jadhav [the opening batsman from Maharashtra who topped the batting charts last season]. I had heard that Jadhav was slow with his run-scoring, but he scored almost 160 in a day against Kenya. He smashed a hundred in a session the next day and finished on 260 not out. I wouldn't put him ahead of Aakash Chopra, but he poses a big threat.And the bowlers? Bahutule was fantastic, but Shib Shankar Paul was another surprise performer. He got five wickets consistently on really flat wickets in Harare. People say that players from weaker states make it to the side through the back door. But Paul proved that wrong with his performance.Any disappointments at all? Munaf Patel, the fast bowler from Mumbai, was a big disappointment. He developed a shoulder injury and I see it more of a mental problem than physical. The physio checked Munaf and said everything was OK. But he could not bowl and finish his spells. He played one-and-a-half matches in a one-and-a-half-month tour.Do you think the quality of the reserve team is getting closer to that of the national team? Last year, six players from the A team played for the senior team. This year, Karthik has played. This tells me that this concept is working out well. If any senior player has to be replaced, there is a ready substitute available.What about the fitness standards of the players? I would still say that they are more gym-fit than match-fit. There is no need of going to the gym after you score a 200 or take five wickets. They will be better off if the same energy can be used in a match to score a fifty or take three wickets.What about your own future as a coach? I get appointed only on a tour-to-tour basis. For the past one year, I have been asking BCCI to inform me in advance so that I can plan my own programme. But it is not happening. When India A played against New Zealand at Rajkot last year, the board secretary called me on the eve of the match and asked me to join the team.

Dhoni's innings is the third highest by a wicketkeeper in the shorter version of the game. Australia's Adam Gilchrist occupies the first two places. The previous highest score by an Indian wicketkeeper was 145 by Rahul Dravid against Sri Lanka at Taunton in the 1999 World Cup. Dhoni's innings is also the highest ever played by any wicketkeeper batsman against Pakistan beating Alec Stewart's and Gilchrist's 103 in 1992 and 1998 respectively.

The 37-year old wicketkeeper-batsman will not be part of the T20I series against West Indies and Australia in November.However, chief selector MSK Prasad made it a point to say \"it is not the end of Dhoni in T20Is\" and added that they are looking to firm up back-up options behind the stumps. To that end, both Rishabh Pant and Dinesh Karthik have been picked for these six matches.Dhoni not part of T20I squad to face West Indies and Australia•Getty ImagesDhoni has been part of 93 of the 104 T20Is that India have played since his debut in December 2006. In that time, he's made 1487 runs at a strke-rate of 127, alongside 54 catches and 33 stumpings. He has also been one of the most recognisable figures in IPL cricket, having played each of the 11 seasons. Having gone through a slump with Rising Pune Supergiant, he scored 455 runs at a strike-rate of 150 for Chennai Super Kings in their title-winning run earlier this year. Since then, he travelled to England as part of the T20I squads, although he got a chance to bat in only one of the three matches.\"The T20Is here and in Australia, he [Dhoni] is not going to play, because we are also looking at a second wicketkeeper,\" Prasad said at a press conference on Friday. \"That will be between Rishabh and Dinesh Karthik.

The 23-year old last played a T20I in December 2017 but has since then become an important figure in the A team and also took over captaincy of the Delhi Daredevils. His IPL team-mate Shahbaz Nadeem earned an India call-up as well, soon after a world record performance, albeit in 50-over cricket. The left-arm spinner picked up 8 for 10 in September and is part of five spin options that India have chosen to play West Indies, alongside the incumbents Yuzvendra Chahal and Kuldeep Yadav, and allrounders Krunal Pandya and Washington Sundar. The seam attack will be led by Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Jasprit Bumrah, which now includes additional variation in the form of left-arm quick Khaleel Ahmed. Fast bowlers Deepak Chahar and Siddharth Kaul, who were part of India's previous T20I squad on the tour of England, were left out.In ODI news, Kedar Jadhav, who was ignored for the third game against West Indies despite his saying he was fully fit, has been recalled to play the final two matches of the series. \"He is coming back from an injury which is why we asked him to play in the Duleep Trophy,\" Prasad said. \"We expected their team to go on to play the final which is why he's not a part of the third ODI but is part of the fourth and fifth ODIs.\"MS DhoniShahbaz NadeemIndiaWest Indies in India Matches (11) Matches (11) (11) SL v PAK (1) SL v PAK (1) (1) SA-W in ENG (1) SA-W in ENG (1) (1) County DIV1 (5) County DIV1 (5) (5) County DIV2 (3) County DIV2 (3) (3) TNPL (1) TNPL (1) (1) Live • 2nd TEST • Galle • 2nd TEST (15.1 ov) & Day 3 - Session 2: Sri Lanka lead by 206 runs.

A career average of nearly 52 and a strike rate of 89 is an even rarer achievement On Thursday, in the fourth match of the five-match series against Sri Lanka, Mahendra Singh Dhoni will become only the 20th player to play 300 or more One Day Internationals (ODIs). Four players have played more than 400 matches (Sachin Tendulkar, Mahela Jayawardene, Sanath Jayasuriya and Kumara Sangakkara), while Shahid Afridi, with 398 games, just missed the mark. On Thursday, in the fourth match of the five-match series against Sri Lanka, Mahendra Singh Dhoni will become only the 20th player to play 300 or more One Day Internationals (ODIs). Four players have played more than 400 matches (Sachin Tendulkar, Mahela Jayawardene, Sanath Jayasuriya and Kumara Sangakkara), while Shahid Afridi, with 398 games, just missed the mark. “It is never easy to survive for so many matches in international cricket. It speaks about Dhoni’s longevity in the game. He is a terrific all-rounder,\" says former New Zealand all-rounder Chris Harris, who played 250 matches in the 1990s. “Like Tendulkar, Dhoni is one of the least criticized players in India and that speaks volumes about his contribution,\" says former Indian wicketkeeper Kiran More, who was the chief selector in 2004, when Dhoni was selected. Dhoni’s career graph has been so unreal that even without a biopic, his story will look filmi. It is not surprising that his best moments have come in ODIs. A career average of nearly 52 and a strike rate of around 89 is a rare achievement. Dhoni will be only the second wicketkeeper after Sangakkara to play 300 games. The former Sri Lankan captain represented his country in 360 matches as a wicketkeeper-batsman. South Africa’s Mark Boucher played 295 matches, while Adam Gilchrist managed 287 games. “I will put him alongside Gilchrist as an all-time best wicketkeeper-batsman in ODIs. Some of the decisions he has taken as captain are incredible and probably defined him as a player and gave an aura to his personality,\" adds Harris. The former India captain debuted four years after Yuvraj Singh, who spoke recently about the importance of this landmark in England. “To play for India is one thing but to sustain a long international career is tough. One needs to believe that one can do what one has done before and achieve the same things again,\" Singh said on 15 June during the Champions Trophy. What separates Dhoni from any other India player is that he has never been dropped from a game or even “rested\" (an oft-used euphemism). “I have been amazed by his awareness and understanding of the modern game,\" says Rudra Pratap Singh, a former India player. “He was blessed with a naturally athletic body but after playing 200 ODIs, he started putting a lot of effort into improving his fitness. He realized that with so much workload, only being supremely fit can take him to the 2019 World Cup,\" says Rudra Pratap, who has played 58 matches with Dhoni. Dhoni may not be able to go past Sangakkara’s run tally of 14,234 (the most runs after Tendulkar) but as a wicketkeeper he has better numbers. During the second ODI of the current series on 24 August, Dhoni equalled Sangakkara’s record of most stumpings (99) in ODIs. But Dhoni took 106 fewer matches to do so. No one has remained unbeaten while batting more than Dhoni—40 of those occasions came in ODIs that India won. Already in this series, he has unbeaten scores of 45 and 67 in the two matches in which he batted. So the statistic that Dhoni has the highest average (99.16, Kohli has 97.68 and Michael Bevan, 86.25) during successful run-chases in ODIs (minimum 1,000 runs), doesn’t come as a surprise. “Never try to judge him on his numbers alone. The way he bats with the middle-order and lower-order batsmen is exemplary and should be part of coaching manuals by now,\" says Rudra Pratap. Among the current set of players, only Suresh Raina, with 223 matches so far, appears close to Dhoni. But the Uttar Pradesh player last represented India in 2015 and it’s doubtful whether he will get into the team again. Sri Lanka’s Upul Tharanga (209) and Lasith Malinga (202) look unlikely to go past 300 if age, form and fitness are taken into consideration. Kohli, with 191 matches currently, looks like the only one with a realistic chance. The reason why 300 may be a distant dream is also because ODIs have started losing their charm, to the extent that their future is being debated. The proliferation of Twenty20 leagues across the world has contributed to this. So has the number of ODI matches and bilateral series without any context, especially in the subcontinent. Harris, for instance, says, “It will not be easier for future generations as most of cricket is moving towards the shortest (T20) format.\" More, however, differs, “It may not be easy to play 300 matches in the future but I don’t think this format is going to die.\" Dhoni has another statistic to aim for. Other than two Australians (Steve Waugh and Ricky Ponting), from this list of 300 plus ODIs, no player has won the world cup twice. That is something Dhoni will hope to aim for in 2019.

Four players have played more than 400 matches (Sachin Tendulkar, Mahela Jayawardene, Sanath Jayasuriya and Kumara Sangakkara), while Shahid Afridi, with 398 games, just missed the mark. “It is never easy to survive for so many matches in international cricket. It speaks about Dhoni’s longevity in the game. He is a terrific all-rounder,” says former New Zealand all-rounder Chris Harris, who played 250 matches in the 1990s. “Like Tendulkar, Dhoni is one of the least criticized players in India and that speaks volumes about his contribution,” says former Indian wicketkeeper Kiran More, who was the chief selector in 2004, when Dhoni was selected. Dhoni’s career graph has been so unreal that even without a biopic, his story will look filmi. It is not surprising that his best moments have come in ODIs. A career average of nearly 52 and a strike rate of around 89 is a rare achievement. Dhoni will be only the second wicketkeeper after Sangakkara to play 300 games. The former Sri Lankan captain represented his country in 360 matches as a wicketkeeper-batsman. South Africa’s Mark Boucher played 295 matches, while Adam Gilchrist managed 287 games. “I will put him alongside Gilchrist as an all-time best wicketkeeper-batsman in ODIs. Some of the decisions he has taken as captain are incredible and probably defined him as a player and gave an aura to his personality,” adds Harris. The former India captain debuted four years after Yuvraj Singh, who spoke recently about the importance of this landmark in England. “To play for India is one thing but to sustain a long international career is tough. One needs to believe that one can do what one has done before and achieve the same things again,” Singh said on 15 June during the Champions Trophy. What separates Dhoni from any other India player is that he has never been dropped from a game or even “rested” (an oft-used euphemism). “I have been amazed by his awareness and understanding of the modern game,” says Rudra Pratap Singh, a former India player. “He was blessed with a naturally athletic body but after playing 200 ODIs, he started putting a lot of effort into improving his fitness. He realized that with so much workload, only being supremely fit can take him to the 2019 World Cup,” says Rudra Pratap, who has played 58 matches with Dhoni. Dhoni may not be able to go past Sangakkara’s run tally of 14,234 (the most runs after Tendulkar) but as a wicketkeeper he has better numbers. During the second ODI of the current series on 24 August, Dhoni equalled Sangakkara’s record of most stumpings (99) in ODIs. But Dhoni took 106 fewer matches to do so. No one has remained unbeaten while batting more than Dhoni—40 of those occasions came in ODIs that India won. Already in this series, he has unbeaten scores of 45 and 67 in the two matches in which he batted. So the statistic that Dhoni has the highest average (99.16, Kohli has 97.68 and Michael Bevan, 86.25) during successful run-chases in ODIs (minimum 1,000 runs), doesn’t come as a surprise. “Never try to judge him on his numbers alone. The way he bats with the middle-order and lower-order batsmen is exemplary and should be part of coaching manuals by now,” says Rudra Pratap. Among the current set of players, only Suresh Raina, with 223 matches so far, appears close to Dhoni. But the Uttar Pradesh player last represented India in 2015 and it’s doubtful whether he will get into the team again. Sri Lanka’s Upul Tharanga (209) and Lasith Malinga (202) look unlikely to go past 300 if age, form and fitness are taken into consideration. Kohli, with 191 matches currently, looks like the only one with a realistic chance. The reason why 300 may be a distant dream is also because ODIs have started losing their charm, to the extent that their future is being debated. The proliferation of Twenty20 leagues across the world has contributed to this. So has the number of ODI matches and bilateral series without any context, especially in the subcontinent.

नये संक्रमण के मामले सामने आ रहे हैं, जिसके चलते भारत की स्वास्थ्य व्यवस्था चरमरा गई है। इस बीच कोरोना से जूझ रहे पीड़ित मरीजों की मदद के लिये कई मशहूर हस्तियां अपना-अपना योगदान देती नजर आ रही हैं। भारतीय टीम के पूर्व हरफनमौला खिलाड़ी इरफान पठान भी अपने भाई के साथ दिल्ली के कई इलाकों में मदद करते नजर आ रहे हैं। इस दिग्गज खिलाड़ी ने शनिवार को अपनी मदद बढ़ाते हुए सोशल मीडिया के जरिये होने वाली अपनी सारी कमाई को कोरोना के खिलाफ लड़ाई में दान करने का ऐलान किया है। उल्लेखनीय है कि भारत में जारी कोरोना की दूसरी लहर में हर रोज 3 लाख से ज्यादा नये संक्रमण के केस और 3000 से ज्यादा मौत के मामले सामने आ रहे हैं और इस दौरान जरूरतमंद मरीजों के लिये अस्पताल में बेड, ऑक्सीजन और दवाइयों की कमी से जूझने की खबर भी आ रही है। और पढ़ें: बॉल टैम्पिरिंग स्कैंडल पर बैनक्रॉफ्ट ने किया बड़ा खुलासा, कहा-

जंग में शामिल हैं। इरफान पठान के पिता महमूद खान पठान बड़ौदा में अपने चैरिटेबल ट्रस्ट के जरिये कोरोना संक्रमित मरीजों के लिये भोजन की व्यवस्था कर रहे हैं। पठान परिवार ने पिछले साल भी लॉकडाउन के दौरान

After being summoned back into the Indian squad from domestic cricket, he is now he is a national hero after match figures of 13 for 196 in the Calcutta Test. It was a marvellous performance from a player who has twice been on the verge of being confined to the cricket dustbin since making his Test debut three years ago. The 20-year-old boy from Punjab's Jalandhar city has overcome the trauma of being labelled a 'chucker' by the International Cricket Council and 'indisciplined' by the director of India's National Cricket Academy (NCA). Propelled into the national squad in his second season of first-class cricket in 1998, Harbhajan impressed the selectors enough for them to keep faith with him despite wickets being hard to come by.

His world was turned upside down, however, by the ICC deemed his bowling action to be suspect. Harbhajan underwent 'corrective' coaching under former England spinner Fred Titmus and ex-Indian Test player Erapalli Prasanna guided his recovery from the mental trauma. A remodelled action sometimes results in reduced effectiveness. The potential consequence for him were immense, given India's traditional strength in spin bowling. Sachin Tendulkar's backing resulted in a place in the squad which toured Australia in 1999-200, but Harbhajan was reduced to a mere passenger as the pitches Down Under compelled team management to rely on medium pacers. Striving to stay afloat, Harbhajan's confidence took further beating when he was thrown out of the NCA last year along with two others.

Suddenly the selectors were casting around for the best alternatives and turned again to Harbhajan.

Yuvraj Singh was also named in the squad that was announced by the state selection committee on Wednesday (October 3). Mandeep Singh, who had an impressive run with Kings XI Punjab in the IPL V, was named vice-captain. The other prominent members of the squad are Rahul Sharma, the legspinner, Sandeep Sharma, India’s leading wicket-taker in the victorious Under-19 World Cup campaign in Australia, Karan Goel and Bipul Sharma. The players will attend a conditioning camp from October 8 in Mohali, which will be monitored by Harvinder Singh, Punjab’s bowling coach. The players will also play two two-day practice matches in order to assess the fitness levels, according to MP Pandove, secretary of the Punjab Cricket Association. Harbhajan, however, will miss out on the conditioning camp as he will be leading Mumbai Indians at the fourth edition of the Champions League Twenty20 in South Africa from October 9 to 28. Harbhajan and Yuvraj both made their comeback to the Indian squad at the ICC World Twenty20 in Sri Lanka. Harbhajan marked his return with a four-wicket haul against England to be named Man of the Match, while Yuvraj also had a decent outing with both bat and ball, which saw him earn the Man of the Match award in India’s last Super Eights fixture against South Africa. 8 Photos 13 Photos 9 Photos © FW SPORTS AND MEDIA INDIA PRIVATE LIMITED.

The Indian cricket team is performing well. The relationship with the home town has improved due to religious faith. I have been visiting Mangaluru for the last seven years. May everybody be blessed,” said former Indian cricketer and acting director of Team India, Ravi Shastri. He was speaking to media persons after visiting Karkala Erlappadi Govindooru Karvalu Mahavishnu temple on Wednesday, February 17. The historical Nagabana deity that the family of Ravi Shastri has been praying to is in the premises of the temple. His family has been living in Mumbai for years. When Shastri did not have children even after eighteen years of married life, he went to ask an astrologer who said that it was because he forgot the deity adored by his family. Thereafter Ravi Shastri has been visiting Karkala Karvalu Vishnumoorthi temple. As a result of his visit, he was blessed with a baby girl. Ravi Shastri has been visiting the temple every year since then. He reached the temple at 9.30 am on Wednesday, February 17 morning. After religious rituals at the principal deity Vishnu Moorthy, he visited Nagabana and received Prasada from the priest. Udupi district police superintendent Annamalai, Mujrai department member Kenja Sridhar Tantri couple too visited the temple at the same time and prayed. Temple trustee Somashekar Rao, Karvalu origin senior journalist Manohar Prasad, Yuvaraj Nayak and others were present. Ashok Karanth conducted Pooja. Ramananda Patri performed Naga Darshana.

Nottinghamshire Sussex Match starts in 1 hr 56 mins Lyca Kovai Kings Siechem Madurai Panthers Match starts in 5 hrs 41 mins Alphabetically sorted top ten of players who have played the most matches across formats in the last 12 months Full Name Born Age Batting Style Bowling Style Playing Role RELATIONS (uncle) Other TEAMS A pocket-sized powerhouse, Chetan Sharma made up for his lack of height and build with a good action and thrust from the shoulders at the point of delivery. He made his international debut at 17 and a year later, aged 18 years, 288 days, played his first Test. He made it memorable by bowling Mohsin Khan with his fifth ball - the third Indian to take a wicket in his first over in Test cricket. He remained Kapil Dev's able partner for almost five years. Though the experts were of the view that he would not last long because of his slight physique, Chetan proved them wrong by some lion-hearted performances. He first gave notice when he took 14 wickets in three Tests in Sri Lanka in 1985, including his first five wicket haul. He did even better in England in 1986 when he took 16 wickets in two Tests, including the first ten-wicket haul by an Indian bowler in that country. Against the West Indies in 1987-88, he had his fourth five-wicket haul in Tests at New Delhi. He played his last Test in the West Indies in 1989 but continued to represent India in one day internationals until 1994-95. Chetan was also a more than useful tailend batsman, as he proved by holding out against McDermott, Hughes and Reid for over two hours in making 54 when sent in as a nightwatchman against Australia in 1985, or when hitting an exhilerating 101 not out when he was promoted to No. 4 against England in the MRF World Series match in 1989. In retirement, Chetan has found success as a popular TV commentator.

He made his international debut at 17 and a year later, aged 18 years, 288 days, played his first Test. He made it memorable by bowling Mohsin Khan with his fifth ball - the third Indian to take a wicket in his first over in Test cricket. He remained Kapil Dev's able partner for almost five years. Though the experts were of the view that he would not last long because of his slight physique, Chetan proved them wrong by some lion-hearted performances. He first gave notice when he took 14 wickets in three Tests in Sri Lanka in 1985, including his first five wicket haul. He did even better in England in 1986 when he took 16 wickets in two Tests, including the first ten-wicket haul by an Indian bowler in that country. Against the West Indies in 1987-88, he had his fourth five-wicket haul in Tests at New Delhi. He played his last Test in the West Indies in 1989 but continued to represent India in one day internationals until 1994-95. Chetan was also a more than useful tailend batsman, as he proved by holding out against McDermott, Hughes and Reid for over two hours in making 54 when sent in as a nightwatchman against Australia in 1985, or when hitting an exhilerating 101 not out when he was promoted to No. 4 against England in the MRF World Series match in 1989. In retirement, Chetan has found success as a popular TV commentator.
