पिता एक प्रमुख वकील थे, उनकी माँ प्रथम इंटरस्टेट बैंक सिस्टम और यूनाइटेड वे के निदेशक मंडल में सेवारत थीं और उनके पिता, जे. डब्ल्यू. मैक्‍सवेल, एक राष्‍ट्रीय बैंक के अध्‍यक्ष थे। गेट्स की एक बड़ी बहन, क्रिस्टी (क्रिस्तिंने) और एक छोटी बहन, लिब्बी है। वे अपने परिवार में सम नाम के चौथे व्यक्ति थे, लेकिन विलियम गेट्स III या \"ट्रे\" के नाम से जाने जाते थे क्योंकि पिता ने अपने नामांत में III जोड़ना छोड़ दिया था। उनके जीवन के प्रारंभिक काल में उनके माता पिता के मन उनके लिए कानून का कैरियर था। वह तेरह वर्ष की उम्र में लेकसाइड स्कूल नामक प्रस्तुति विद्यालय में भर्ती हुए। जब वे आठवीं कक्षा में थे, विद्यालय के मदर क्लब ने स्कूल के रद्दी सामानों की बिक्री से प्राप्त धन का उपयोग के छात्रों के लिए एक ऐएसआर - 33 दूरटंकण टर्मिनल तथा जनरल इलेक्ट्रिक (जी.ई.) कंप्यूटर पर एक कंप्यूटर समय्खंड खरीदने लिए किया। गेट्स ने बेसिक प्रोग्रामिंग भाषा में (जी.ई.) सिस्टम की प्रोग्रामिंग में रूचि दिखाई और उन्हें उनकी इस रूचि लिए गणित की कक्षाओं से छूट दी गई। उन्होंने अपना पहला कंप्यूटर प्रोग्राम इस मशीन पर लिखा : जो था टिक-टैक-टो (tic-tac-toe) का कार्यान्वयन और उपयोगकर्ता को कंप्यूटर से खेल खेलने का अवसर प्रदान करता था। गेट्स मशीन से सहज आकर्षित थे कि कैसे यह हमेशा सॉफ़्टवेयर कोड सठिक संपादित करता है। बाद में इस क्षण को पीछे मुड कर देखते हुए उन्होंने टिप्पणी की और कहा, \"मशीन में जरुर कुछ गूढ़ बात रही होगी.\" क्लब के दान का अर्थ समाप्त हो जाने के बाद, वे अन्य के साथ डीईसी (DEC)पीडीपी (PDP)मिनी कंप्यूटरों (minicomputer) सहित सिस्टमों पर समय माँगते रहे। इनमें से एक सिस्टम पीडीपी-१० (PDP-10) कंप्यूटर सेण्टर कारपोरेशन (सीसीसी) का था, जिसके द्वारा लेकसाइड के चार छात्रों - गेट्स, पाल एलेन (Paul Allen), रिक वेइलैंड (Ric Weiland) और केंट एवंस पर पूरे गर्मी महीने लिए प्रतिबन्ध लगा दिया गया ---जब उन्हें ऑपरेटिंग सिस्टम में रहे खामिओं का अपव्यवहार कर निःशुल्क कंप्यूटर में समय प्राप्त करते हुए पकड़ा गया था। प्रतिबंध के अंत में, चारों छात्रों ने नि:शुल्क कंप्यूटर समय के बदले में सीसीसी के सॉफ्टवेर को खामिओं से मुक्त करने की पेशकश की। दूरटंकण मध्यम से सिस्टम के उपयोग के बजाए, गेट्स के कार्यालयों में जाते रहे और विभिन्न कार्यक्रमों लिए सोर्स कोड (source code) जो कि फोर्टरन (FORTRAN), लिस्प (LISP) और मशीन भाषा सिस्टमों में व्यवहृत होते हैं, का अध्ययन किया। साथ यह व्यवस्था 1970 तक चलती रही, जब वह बंद हो गई। अगले वर्ष, इन्फोर्मेशन साइंसेस आइएनसी. छात्रों समय एवं रॉयल्टी उपलब्ध कराकर कोबोल (COBOL), एक पेरोल प्रोग्राम लिखने लिए किराए पर रख लिया। जब प्रशासकों को उनके प्रोग्रामिंग क्षमताओं के बारे में जानकारी हुई, गेट्स कक्षाओं में को अनुसूचित करने लिए विद्यालय हेतु प्रोग्राम लिखा। वे कोड में इसतरह संशोधन किए ताकि उन्हें अधिकांश महिला छात्राओंवाली में रखा जाता रहे। में उन्होंने वर्णन किया कि \" एक मशीन, जिसपर मैं इतना भ्रान्ति रहित सफल प्रदर्शन कर सकता था, से मुझे चीरकर अलग करना कठिन था।\" 17 की आयु में, गेट्स एलन साथ मिलकर, इंटेल 8008 प्रोसेसर (Traf-O-Data) पर आधारित यातायात काउनटर (traffic counter) बनाने लिए ट्राफ-ओ-डाटा (Intel 8008) एक उपक्रम बनाया। गेट्स स्कूल से वर्ष 1973 में स्नातक हुए। संयुक्त राज्य में कॉलेज दाखिले लिए मानकीकृत परीक्षा SATs में वे 1600 में 1590 अंक प्राप्त किए, एवं तत्पश्चात सन् में हारवर्ड कॉलेज (Harvard College) में उनका नामांकन हुआ। हालाँकि हार्वर्ड में, उन्हें अपने भविष्य के व्यापारिक साझीदार स्टीव बल्ल्मेर (Steve Ballmer) मिले,

प्रथम कंप्यूटर चीप है जिसका मूल्य $200 से कम है, BASIC में कम सकता है तथा उस प्राप्त व्यक्तिगत कंप्यूटर के अन्दर चलनेवाला सबसे वहनयोग्य चीप है। उन्होंने तय यही एक मौका है समय का फायदा उठाने का एवं पॉल

जिसमें अल्टेयर 8800 (Altair 8800) प्रर्दशित हुआ था, बिल गेट्स ने माइक्रो इंस्ट्रुमेंटेशन एंड टेलीमेट्री सिस्टम (Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems) (MITS), जो नए माइक्रो कंप्यूटर के जन्मदाता

Gates went on to become the world's richest man; Kildall died in a brawl, scarcely remembered outside Silicon Valley for his seminal contribution. Dan Bricklin first spreadsheet program, VisiCalc, in 1979. After a costly legal spat alongside partner Bob Frankston, Bricklin sold out for less than $3 million to Lotus, which created a nine-figure fortune for Mitch Kapor from its VisiCalc imitation called 1-2-3. And even that killer app didn't make the really big bucks for its owners. The biggest spreadsheet fortune wound up in the coffers of Gates' Microsoft (nasdaq: MSFT people ), whose 1-2-3 knockoff, Excel, is the market leader today. Gordon Why is it that innovators die poor--while imitators succeed beyond all measure? There are notable exceptions. Thomas A. Edison, an inventive genius but also a shrewd entrepreneur, was a founder of what became the General Electric Co. (nyse: GE ) At his death in 1931 he left a $12 million estate, big enough to have put him on The FORBES 400 list, had it then existed. But his rival and, some would argue, intellectual superior, Nikola Tesla, spent his last years feeding pigeons outside New York's Public Library, and died nearly penniless. With more than 700 patents to his name, Tesla invented radio, the coil transformer, wireless communication, fluorescent lights and the alternating-current motor, which allowed electricity to flow over long distances. He had about as much business savvy as a puppy; he might have been fabulously wealthy had he not signed away AC royalties to George Westinghouse and patent rights to a wireless broadcasting system to J.P. Morgan. Indeed, the history of American commerce is replete with visionaries who couldn't turn their prodigious creations into commensurate bank accounts. Some were temperamentally unsuited to be ruthless businessmen. Maybe Bricklin is in that category. \"I'm not rich because I invented VisiCalc, but I feel that I've made a change the world,\" he said in 1985. \"That's a satisfaction money can't buy.\" Other inventors, like Charles Goodyear, were easy prey for crooks. \"The of invention,\" he wrote the 1850s, \"proves that whoever attempts by inventions to improve the conditions of others, usually impairs his own, except so far as he may add his happiness from the satisfaction of having done good to others.\" Goodyear a dreamer, careless of his appearance and indifferent to money. His obsession, of course, was rubber. The substance had been known to the Western world since Columbus brought it back on his second voyage, but it had no practical use until the 18th century, when it was found that rubber removed pencil marks from paper--the origin of the word \"rubber.\" In the early 19th century the Scotsman Charles Macintosh developed a process for making waterproof fabric by putting a layer of rubber between two layers of cloth. It was first important use of rubber, the misspelled \"mackintosh\" was soon in great demand in Britain's rainy climate. By the 1830s the head of Macintosh & Co. was Thomas Hancock, the most important person Britain's growing rubber industry. A small rubber boom developed in both Britain and America as companies sought to utilize its remarkable qualities of elasticity and water repellency. But rubber had many drawbacks. For one thing was smelly, a bit like the bottom of a compost pile. But far worse, it melted at high temperatures and became brittle at low ones. This was less a problem the temperate climate of England, but the U.S. a fatal flaw. Goodyear decided that he was going to solve this problem. For ten years Goodyear labored to find the answer. Time and time again he thought he had it, only find had failed again. The hardware business he ran with his father went bankrupt, and he often found himself arrested for debt and thrown into jail. His family sometimes did not have to eat, but Goodyear soldiered on, turning the kitchen of wherever was living into a laboratory, commandeering pots and pans, pawning the furniture when necessary to raise money to continue his experiments, borrowing from anyone foolish to lend to him. In 1839 a happy accident gave him answer. had mixed rubber with sulphur and white lead, and dropped some on kitchen stove. Instead of melting, it hardened. But Goodyear wasn't a trained chemist (the chemistry rubber was completely understood only well into the 20th century). It took him several more years the right combination rubber, solvent, sulphur, white lead and heat that could be turned into an industrial process. Visions of wealth danced in Goodyear's head, but he fatal mistake. He sent samples to Thomas Hancock without filing for a patent in Britain, which has a strict first-to-file rule for granting patents. He thought the secret was safe and asked for £50,000--an enormous sum then--as the price of sharing it. But Hancock, deeply knowledgeable about rubber and its limitations, realized instantly the significance of Goodyear's achievement. He proceeded to steal it. Reverse-engineering the samples Goodyear had sent him, Hancock filed in Britain in 1844, a few months before Goodyear, who had obtained patents both U.S. and France. But the British market--in the mid-19th century, important the world--was denied to Goodyear. His brother-in-law paid Goodyear a flat fee of $50,000 for the American rights and founded what would grow into Uniroyal. The Goodyear Tire & Rubber (nyse: GT ), founded nearly 40 years after Goodyear's in 1860, was only named in his honor. Despite its effect the future the world economy, all that Charles Goodyear's great invention earned him was immortality. Kildall maintained for years that Gates had hoodwinked him it came to winning the standard for IBM, the verge of introducing its first PC. At the least, was outmaneuvered by a brilliant opportunist who, himself a software engineer of some prowess, could foresee future applications that may have eluded--or failed to interest--Kildall. Kildall was more interested in solving problems than in scoring profits. A professor of computer science at U.S. Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, Calif., he convinced a fledgling Intel in 1972 to give the prototype of its Sim-4 chip, which wouldn't be available the public for another four years. Out of this collaboration came Kildall's Control Program for Microcomputers--or CP/M, for microprocessors, which he sold to programmers. In 1976 Kildall and his wife, Dorothy McEwen, founded Digital Research International, to sell CP/M software and language compilers. All the while Gates and Paul Allen were launching Microsoft and trying to adapt the Basic programming language invented by others in 1964 the forerunner the PC, the Altair 8800. By 1976 had emerged as one most serious (and contentious) capitalists the subculture of geeks who freely shared new ideas a group called the Home Brew Computer Club, cofounded by Kildall. \"Who can afford to do professional work for nothing?\" Gates complained in an open letter the club. He claimed he'd spent $40,000 in computer time developing Basic, but that, because only one in ten Altair owners paid the software, his compensation amounted to $2 an hour. \"There is very little incentive to make this software to hobbyists,\" he wrote. \"Most directly, the thing you do is theft.\" The two software pioneers collided in 1980. That's when IBM launched its top-secret program, Project Chess, to develop its PC. It needed an system and, surely, CP/M would have fit the bill. But the time was onto a new problem--building a compiler a language called PL-1, designed by IBM. What happened next is still a matter of dispute. IBM sent a team to Redmond, Wash. for help on Chess, according to Michael S. Malone's Infinite Loop Doubleday, 1999). Why Big Blue stooped to little Microsoft, Malone suggests, is explained by the fact that Gates' mother, Mary, sat the board the United Way of America alongside IBM Chairman John Opel. After two meetings held under promises of confidentiality, IBM offered a hardware and software consulting deal. It wanted a desktop a small sum; Gates was willing to oblige--on condition he be given sell copies to other computer makers for whatever the traffic would bear. IBMalso asked about CP/M: Could it buy the system from Gates & Co.? Gates explained that IBM have to with and offered to set up the meeting. Gates' account is he called and told him that \"important customers\" were to visit and he should \"treat them right.\" A nondisclosure agreement prevented him from offering more detail. Kildall disputed this account. claimed had not impressed on the importance the meeting--and so Kildall skipped it another appointment in San Jose, leaving the IBMers the hands of McEwan, who handled hardware accounts. She refused to sign a agreement without Kildall's knowledge, and so IBM left Research without a word about Project Chess. With Kildall's apparent default, IBM approached Microsoft for operating system. It didn't have one. But Allen knew someone who did: his friend Tim Paterson at tiny Seattle Computer Products--whose SCP-DOS, designed to run the 8086 microchip, Gates bought for $75,000. was shocked when he learned that Microsoft had sold to IBM; he assumed had a gentleman's agreement with Gates to provide CP/M to supplement programming languages like Basic. IBM eventually got in touch with Kildall, report Stephen Manes Paul Andrew in Gates Touchstone (otc: TASA ), 1993). But Kildall, they speculate, was wary of signing rights over to IBM because was his only product the time. Moreover, was unable to supply a price or a delivery date the newest version his operating system, the CP/M-86. It ended bitterly. Kildall threatened to sue IBM over using Microsoft's system (renamed MS-DOS), he believed been ripped off from his own CP/M. To forestall legal action, offered consumers the choice of either CP/M or MS-DOS. at $240, six times of MS-DOS, CP/M was quickly headed for extinction. Kildall sold Research to Novell in 1991. Three years later he a barroom confrontation with bikers. Kildall may have seen the implications his software until was too late. Other inventors fail to reap the rewards of their ideas since the very qualities that make them so creative--original thinking, obsessive concentration on one goal, detachment from everyday concerns--make it difficult for them with the real, often cruel, world. In 1967 Robert Kearns invented the intermittent windshield wiper, now standard equipment on automobiles. He took the idea the Ford Motor (nyse: F ) in hopes of selling the device. After several years of inconclusive talks, Ford began offering intermittent wipers on various models but without licensing the invention from Kearns, who sued. He finally settled with Ford for $10.2 million and also won a suit against Chrysler (nyse: DCX ) but lost his cases against General Motors (nyse: GM ) and foreign manufacturers. The mess dragged on for than 20 years; with legal meters ticking along steadily, the lawyers ended up as the chief beneficiaries. Spinning machinery 18th century rendered cotton cloth made from fiber cheaper than wool. But cotton remained expensive, because removing the seeds embedded the cotton boll, called ginning, was extremely labor-intensive. A field hand could pick about 50 pounds of cotton bolls a day, but the sticky seeds from that much cotton took a single worker a full 25 days' labor. Eli Whitney revolutionized the textile industry by inventing cotton gin in 1792. But he never got really rich the tool. It wasn't because someone stole his patent. Instead, the device was so simple that its patent was nearly impossible to enforce. The gin consisted of nothing than a wooden roller studded with nails set half an inch apart. The nails pulled cotton lint through a comb too fine to allow seeds to pass, and a revolving brush then swept the lint off the nails and a compartment. With gin a worker could clean of raw cotton a day. the labor component of ginning cotton reduced a factor of 25, cloth plummeted and demand soared, driving early Industrial Revolution both England and New England. The American South turned out be the best place on earth to grow the short-staple cotton that was best suited to Whitney's invention, a vast cotton boom ensued. The U.S. exported 2 million cotton to Europe in 1794. By 1860 it exported 1.8 billion pounds, constituting than half the dollar value of all American exports. time Whitney received patent on an improved the in March 1794, gins were already widely in use, easily constructed by any competent carpenter. Whitney a partner up a factory in New Haven, Conn. the factory soon burned down and, while rebuilt, to compete with nearly ubiquitous homebuilt gins. Much of Whitney's time was taken up with lawsuits seeking to enforce an unenforceable patent. Edwin H. Armstrong already had two notable inventions--the regenerative the superheterodyne circuits, which amplified radio signals--by time he patent a wide-band frequency modulation (FM) system (see p. 138). he spent the rest his life fighting the Federal Communications Commission for spectrum and RCA's David Sarnoff, who first ignored FM, then tried to buy out Armstrong and finally installed FM receivers in its TV sets a license. Broke and despondent, Armstrong jumped the window his 13th floor New York City apartment. Some the greatest failures to exploit brilliant technologies have befallen not individuals but hidebound corporations. The award for signal ineptitude in this respect must go to Xerox's (nyse: XRX ) Palo Alto Research Center. Founded a research division in 1970, PARC invented many what are now regarded the essential attributes the personal computer: the graphical user interface, the desktop concept, files and folders, multiple windows, Wysiwyg word processing, the Ethernet, the laser printer a more advanced the mouse. And yet, incredibly, Xerox ) capitalized on none of these inventions, because its managers were fixated on how improve its photocopier business. PARC to incorporate some its ideas the Alto, a computer system that have retailed for $17,000--had it ever come to market. Xerox left others, and Apple Computer (nasdaq: AAPL ) among them, to commercialize its discoveries. A few dreamers have eventually been dealt a great hand--fortuitously. Scottish-born Alexander Graham Bell sell his the telephone to Western Union in 1876 flat $100,000. He was turned down; the company didn't think device had much a future. More fortunate still, Bell's father-in-law, Gardiner Hubbard, to found AT&T (nyse: T and exploit Bell's creation. One last happy exception: the story of Gordon Gould. This physicist, who worked the Manhattan Project, a classic eureka moment he lay tossing in bed one Saturday night, Nov. 9, 1957. had conceived laser (an acronym for \"light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation\"). He the night the weekend writing a description, sketching necessary components and describing its many possible practical applications. took his notebook a nearby candy store where the proprietor, a notary public, witnessed it. According to Peter Franken, a physics professor the University of Arizona, the notebook is incredible. \"It's as if God came down and whispered in Gordon's ear and said, ‘Listen, Buddy, this is what you're to do.'\" Gould, be sure, was no 19th-century-style tinkerer he the laser. a Ph.D. candidate at Columbia University, with access to major laboratory facilities. a 19th-century tinkerer's mistake. \"I so ignorant the whole patent procedure that I . [thought] I had to build a model in order to get a patent.\" He didn't file until 1959, by which time scientists at Bell Labs had already beat him to it. Fortunately for Gould, patent law favors first to conceive, not to file.

Gates went on to become the world's richest man; Kildall died in a brawl, scarcely remembered outside Silicon Valley for his seminal contribution. Dan Bricklin first spreadsheet program, VisiCalc, in 1979. After a costly legal spat alongside partner Bob Frankston, Bricklin sold out for less than $3 million to Lotus, which created a nine-figure fortune for Mitch Kapor from its VisiCalc imitation called 1-2-3. And even that killer app didn't make the really big bucks for its owners. The biggest spreadsheet fortune wound up in the coffers of Gates' Microsoft (nasdaq: MSFT people ), whose 1-2-3 knockoff, Excel, is the market leader today. Gordon Why is it that innovators die poor--while imitators succeed beyond all measure? There are notable exceptions. Thomas A. Edison, an inventive genius but also a shrewd entrepreneur, was a founder of what became the General Electric Co. (nyse: GE ) At his death in 1931 he left a $12 million estate, big enough to have put him on The FORBES 400 list, had it then existed. But his rival and, some would argue, intellectual superior, Nikola Tesla, spent his last years feeding pigeons outside New York's Public Library, and died nearly penniless. With more than 700 patents to his name, Tesla invented radio, the coil transformer, wireless communication, fluorescent lights and the alternating-current motor, which allowed electricity to flow over long distances. He had about as much business savvy as a puppy; he might have been fabulously wealthy had he not signed away AC royalties to George Westinghouse and patent rights to a wireless broadcasting system to J.P. Morgan. Indeed, the history of American commerce is replete with visionaries who couldn't turn their prodigious creations into commensurate bank accounts. Some were temperamentally unsuited to be ruthless businessmen. Maybe Bricklin is in that category. \"I'm not rich because I invented VisiCalc, but I feel that I've made a change the world,\" he said in 1985. \"That's a satisfaction money can't buy.\" Other inventors, like Charles Goodyear, were easy prey for crooks. \"The of invention,\" he wrote the 1850s, \"proves that whoever attempts by inventions to improve the conditions of others, usually impairs his own, except so far as he may add his happiness from the satisfaction of having done good to others.\" Goodyear a dreamer, careless of his appearance and indifferent to money. His obsession, of course, was rubber. The substance had been known to the Western world since Columbus brought it back on his second voyage, but it had no practical use until the 18th century, when it was found that rubber removed pencil marks from paper--the origin of the word \"rubber.\" In the early 19th century the Scotsman Charles Macintosh developed a process for making waterproof fabric by putting a layer of rubber between two layers of cloth. It was first important use of rubber, the misspelled \"mackintosh\" was soon in great demand in Britain's rainy climate. By the 1830s the head of Macintosh & Co. was Thomas Hancock, the most important person Britain's growing rubber industry. A small rubber boom developed in both Britain and America as companies sought to utilize its remarkable qualities of elasticity and water repellency. But rubber had many drawbacks. For one thing was smelly, a bit like the bottom of a compost pile. But far worse, it melted at high temperatures and became brittle at low ones. This was less a problem the temperate climate of England, but the U.S. a fatal flaw. Goodyear decided that he was going to solve this problem. For ten years Goodyear labored to find the answer. Time and time again he thought he had it, only find had failed again. The hardware business he ran with his father went bankrupt, and he often found himself arrested for debt and thrown into jail. His family sometimes did not have to eat, but Goodyear soldiered on, turning the kitchen of wherever was living into a laboratory, commandeering pots and pans, pawning the furniture when necessary to raise money to continue his experiments, borrowing from anyone foolish to lend to him. In 1839 a happy accident gave him answer. had mixed rubber with sulphur and white lead, and dropped some on kitchen stove. Instead of melting, it hardened. But Goodyear wasn't a trained chemist (the chemistry rubber was completely understood only well into the 20th century). It took him several more years the right combination rubber, solvent, sulphur, white lead and heat that could be turned into an industrial process. Visions of wealth danced in Goodyear's head, but he fatal mistake. He sent samples to Thomas Hancock without filing for a patent in Britain, which has a strict first-to-file rule for granting patents. He thought the secret was safe and asked for £50,000--an enormous sum then--as the price of sharing it. But Hancock, deeply knowledgeable about rubber and its limitations, realized instantly the significance of Goodyear's achievement. He proceeded to steal it. Reverse-engineering the samples Goodyear had sent him, Hancock filed in Britain in 1844, a few months before Goodyear, who had obtained patents both U.S. and France. But the British market--in the mid-19th century, important the world--was denied to Goodyear. His brother-in-law paid Goodyear a flat fee of $50,000 for the American rights and founded what would grow into Uniroyal. The Goodyear Tire & Rubber (nyse: GT ), founded nearly 40 years after Goodyear's in 1860, was only named in his honor. Despite its effect the future the world economy, all that Charles Goodyear's great invention earned him was immortality. Kildall maintained for years that Gates had hoodwinked him it came to winning the standard for IBM, the verge of introducing its first PC. At the least, was outmaneuvered by a brilliant opportunist who, himself a software engineer of some prowess, could foresee future applications that may have eluded--or failed to interest--Kildall. Kildall was more interested in solving problems than in scoring profits. A professor of computer science at U.S. Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, Calif., he convinced a fledgling Intel in 1972 to give the prototype of its Sim-4 chip, which wouldn't be available the public for another four years. Out of this collaboration came Kildall's Control Program for Microcomputers--or CP/M, for microprocessors, which he sold to programmers. In 1976 Kildall and his wife, Dorothy McEwen, founded Digital Research International, to sell CP/M software and language compilers. All the while Gates and Paul Allen were launching Microsoft and trying to adapt the Basic programming language invented by others in 1964 the forerunner the PC, the Altair 8800. By 1976 had emerged as one most serious (and contentious) capitalists the subculture of geeks who freely shared new ideas a group called the Home Brew Computer Club, cofounded by Kildall. \"Who can afford to do professional work for nothing?\" Gates complained in an open letter the club. He claimed he'd spent $40,000 in computer time developing Basic, but that, because only one in ten Altair owners paid the software, his compensation amounted to $2 an hour. \"There is very little incentive to make this software to hobbyists,\" he wrote. \"Most directly, the thing you do is theft.\" The two software pioneers collided in 1980. That's when IBM launched its top-secret program, Project Chess, to develop its PC. It needed an system and, surely, CP/M would have fit the bill. But the time was onto a new problem--building a compiler a language called PL-1, designed by IBM. What happened next is still a matter of dispute. IBM sent a team to Redmond, Wash. for help on Chess, according to Michael S. Malone's Infinite Loop Doubleday, 1999). Why Big Blue stooped to little Microsoft, Malone suggests, is explained by the fact that Gates' mother, Mary, sat the board the United Way of America alongside IBM Chairman John Opel. After two meetings held under promises of confidentiality, IBM offered a hardware and software consulting deal. It wanted a desktop a small sum; Gates was willing to oblige--on condition he be given sell copies to other computer makers for whatever the traffic would bear. IBMalso asked about CP/M: Could it buy the system from Gates & Co.? Gates explained that IBM have to with and offered to set up the meeting. Gates' account is he called and told him that \"important customers\" were to visit and he should \"treat them right.\" A nondisclosure agreement prevented him from offering more detail. Kildall disputed this account. claimed had not impressed on the importance the meeting--and so Kildall skipped it another appointment in San Jose, leaving the IBMers the hands of McEwan, who handled hardware accounts. She refused to sign a agreement without Kildall's knowledge, and so IBM left Research without a word about Project Chess. With Kildall's apparent default, IBM approached Microsoft for operating system. It didn't have one. But Allen knew someone who did: his friend Tim Paterson at tiny Seattle Computer Products--whose SCP-DOS, designed to run the 8086 microchip, Gates bought for $75,000. was shocked when he learned that Microsoft had sold to IBM; he assumed had a gentleman's agreement with Gates to provide CP/M to supplement programming languages like Basic. IBM eventually got in touch with Kildall, report Stephen Manes Paul Andrew in Gates Touchstone (otc: TASA ), 1993). But Kildall, they speculate, was wary of signing rights over to IBM because was his only product the time. Moreover, was unable to supply a price or a delivery date the newest version his operating system, the CP/M-86. It ended bitterly. Kildall threatened to sue IBM over using Microsoft's system (renamed MS-DOS), he believed been ripped off from his own CP/M. To forestall legal action, offered consumers the choice of either CP/M or MS-DOS. at $240, six times of MS-DOS, CP/M was quickly headed for extinction. Kildall sold Research to Novell in 1991. Three years later he a barroom confrontation with bikers. Kildall may have seen the implications his software until was too late. Other inventors fail to reap the rewards of their ideas since the very qualities that make them so creative--original thinking, obsessive concentration on one goal, detachment from everyday concerns--make it difficult for them with the real, often cruel, world. In 1967 Robert Kearns invented the intermittent windshield wiper, now standard equipment on automobiles. He took the idea the Ford Motor (nyse: F ) in hopes of selling the device. After several years of inconclusive talks, Ford began offering intermittent wipers on various models but without licensing the invention from Kearns, who sued. He finally settled with Ford for $10.2 million and also won a suit against Chrysler (nyse: DCX ) but lost his cases against General Motors (nyse: GM ) and foreign manufacturers. The mess dragged on for than 20 years; with legal meters ticking along steadily, the lawyers ended up as the chief beneficiaries. Spinning machinery 18th century rendered cotton cloth made from fiber cheaper than wool. But cotton remained expensive, because removing the seeds embedded the cotton boll, called ginning, was extremely labor-intensive. A field hand could pick about 50 pounds of cotton bolls a day, but the sticky seeds from that much cotton took a single worker a full 25 days' labor. Eli Whitney revolutionized the textile industry by inventing cotton gin in 1792. But he never got really rich the tool. It wasn't because someone stole his patent. Instead, the device was so simple that its patent was nearly impossible to enforce. The gin consisted of nothing than a wooden roller studded with nails set half an inch apart. The nails pulled cotton lint through a comb too fine to allow seeds to pass, and a revolving brush then swept the lint off the nails and a compartment. With gin a worker could clean of raw cotton a day. the labor component of ginning cotton reduced a factor of 25, cloth plummeted and demand soared, driving early Industrial Revolution both England and New England. The American South turned out be the best place on earth to grow the short-staple cotton that was best suited to Whitney's invention, a vast cotton boom ensued. The U.S. exported 2 million cotton to Europe in 1794. By 1860 it exported 1.8 billion pounds, constituting than half the dollar value of all American exports. time Whitney received patent on an improved the in March 1794, gins were already widely in use, easily constructed by any competent carpenter. Whitney a partner up a factory in New Haven, Conn. the factory soon burned down and, while rebuilt, to compete with nearly ubiquitous homebuilt gins. Much of Whitney's time was taken up with lawsuits seeking to enforce an unenforceable patent. Edwin H. Armstrong already had two notable inventions--the regenerative the superheterodyne circuits, which amplified radio signals--by time he patent a wide-band frequency modulation (FM) system (see p. 138). he spent the rest his life fighting the Federal Communications Commission for spectrum and RCA's David Sarnoff, who first ignored FM, then tried to buy out Armstrong and finally installed FM receivers in its TV sets a license. Broke and despondent, Armstrong jumped the window his 13th floor New York City apartment. Some the greatest failures to exploit brilliant technologies have befallen not individuals but hidebound corporations. The award for signal ineptitude in this respect must go to Xerox's (nyse: XRX ) Palo Alto Research Center. Founded a research division in 1970, PARC invented many what are now regarded the essential attributes the personal computer: the graphical user interface, the desktop concept, files and folders, multiple windows, Wysiwyg word processing, the Ethernet, the laser printer a more advanced the mouse. And yet, incredibly, Xerox ) capitalized on none of these inventions, because its managers were fixated on how improve its photocopier business. PARC to incorporate some its ideas the Alto, a computer system that have retailed for $17,000--had it ever come to market. Xerox left others, and Apple Computer (nasdaq: AAPL ) among them, to commercialize its discoveries. A few dreamers have eventually been dealt a great hand--fortuitously. Scottish-born Alexander Graham Bell sell his the telephone to Western Union in 1876 flat $100,000. He was turned down; the company didn't think device had much a future. More fortunate still, Bell's father-in-law, Gardiner Hubbard, to found AT&T (nyse: T and exploit Bell's creation. One last happy exception: the story of Gordon Gould. This physicist, who worked the Manhattan Project, a classic eureka moment he lay tossing in bed one Saturday night, Nov. 9, 1957. had conceived laser (an acronym for \"light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation\"). He the night the weekend writing a description, sketching necessary components and describing its many possible practical applications. took his notebook a nearby candy store where the proprietor, a notary public, witnessed it. According to Peter Franken, a physics professor the University of Arizona, the notebook is incredible. \"It's as if God came down and whispered in Gordon's ear and said, ‘Listen, Buddy, this is what you're to do.'\" Gould, be sure, was no 19th-century-style tinkerer he the laser. a Ph.D. candidate at Columbia University, with access to major laboratory facilities. a 19th-century tinkerer's mistake. \"I so ignorant the whole patent procedure that I . [thought] I had to build a model in order to get a patent.\" He didn't file until 1959, by which time scientists at Bell Labs had already beat him to it. Fortunately for Gould, patent law favors first to conceive, not to file. It would take Gould 30 years and millions of dollars to finally establish his priority in laser be awarded patents on its major components. Only in 1987 did the legal dust completely settle. The good news, however, was that the delay made him far richer than he otherwise have been. Had his patents been issued promptly and been uncontested, they have expired before most remunerative uses--from supermarket scanners and weapons systems to scientific instruments and CD and DVD players--had to commercial fruition.

Gates went on to become the world's richest man; Kildall died in a brawl, scarcely remembered outside Silicon Valley for his seminal contribution. Dan Bricklin first spreadsheet program, VisiCalc, in 1979. After a costly legal spat alongside partner Bob Frankston, Bricklin sold out for less than $3 million to Lotus, which created a nine-figure fortune for Mitch Kapor from its VisiCalc imitation called 1-2-3. And even that killer app didn't make the really big bucks for its owners. The biggest spreadsheet fortune wound up in the coffers of Gates' Microsoft (nasdaq: MSFT people ), whose 1-2-3 knockoff, Excel, is the market leader today. Gordon Why is it that innovators die poor--while imitators succeed beyond all measure? There are notable exceptions. Thomas A. Edison, an inventive genius but also a shrewd entrepreneur, was a founder of what became the General Electric Co. (nyse: GE ) At his death in 1931 he left a $12 million estate, big enough to have put him on The FORBES 400 list, had it then existed. But his rival and, some would argue, intellectual superior, Nikola Tesla, spent his last years feeding pigeons outside New York's Public Library, and died nearly penniless. With more than 700 patents to his name, Tesla invented radio, the coil transformer, wireless communication, fluorescent lights and the alternating-current motor, which allowed electricity to flow over long distances. He had about as much business savvy as a puppy; he might have been fabulously wealthy had he not signed away AC royalties to George Westinghouse and patent rights to a wireless broadcasting system to J.P. Morgan. Indeed, the history of American commerce is replete with visionaries who couldn't turn their prodigious creations into commensurate bank accounts. Some were temperamentally unsuited to be ruthless businessmen. Maybe Bricklin is in that category. \"I'm not rich because I invented VisiCalc, but I feel that I've made a change the world,\" he said in 1985. \"That's a satisfaction money can't buy.\" Other inventors, like Charles Goodyear, were easy prey for crooks. \"The of invention,\" he wrote the 1850s, \"proves that whoever attempts by inventions to improve the conditions of others, usually impairs his own, except so far as he may add his happiness from the satisfaction of having done good to others.\" Goodyear a dreamer, careless of his appearance and indifferent to money. His obsession, of course, was rubber. The substance had been known to the Western world since Columbus brought it back on his second voyage, but it had no practical use until the 18th century, when it was found that rubber removed pencil marks from paper--the origin of the word \"rubber.\" In the early 19th century the Scotsman Charles Macintosh developed a process for making waterproof fabric by putting a layer of rubber between two layers of cloth. It was first important use of rubber, the misspelled \"mackintosh\" was soon in great demand in Britain's rainy climate. By the 1830s the head of Macintosh & Co. was Thomas Hancock, the most important person Britain's growing rubber industry. A small rubber boom developed in both Britain and America as companies sought to utilize its remarkable qualities of elasticity and water repellency. But rubber had many drawbacks. For one thing was smelly, a bit like the bottom of a compost pile. But far worse, it melted at high temperatures and became brittle at low ones. This was less a problem the temperate climate of England, but the U.S. a fatal flaw. Goodyear decided that he was going to solve this problem. For ten years Goodyear labored to find the answer. Time and time again he thought he had it, only find had failed again. The hardware business he ran with his father went bankrupt, and he often found himself arrested for debt and thrown into jail. His family sometimes did not have to eat, but Goodyear soldiered on, turning the kitchen of wherever was living into a laboratory, commandeering pots and pans, pawning the furniture when necessary to raise money to continue his experiments, borrowing from anyone foolish to lend to him. In 1839 a happy accident gave him answer. had mixed rubber with sulphur and white lead, and dropped some on kitchen stove. Instead of melting, it hardened. But Goodyear wasn't a trained chemist (the chemistry rubber was completely understood only well into the 20th century). It took him several more years the right combination rubber, solvent, sulphur, white lead and heat that could be turned into an industrial process. Visions of wealth danced in Goodyear's head, but he fatal mistake. He sent samples to Thomas Hancock without filing for a patent in Britain, which has a strict first-to-file rule for granting patents. He thought the secret was safe and asked for £50,000--an enormous sum then--as the price of sharing it. But Hancock, deeply knowledgeable about rubber and its limitations, realized instantly the significance of Goodyear's achievement. He proceeded to steal it. Reverse-engineering the samples Goodyear had sent him, Hancock filed in Britain in 1844, a few months before Goodyear, who had obtained patents both U.S. and France. But the British market--in the mid-19th century, important the world--was denied to Goodyear. His brother-in-law paid Goodyear a flat fee of $50,000 for the American rights and founded what would grow into Uniroyal. The Goodyear Tire & Rubber (nyse: GT ), founded nearly 40 years after Goodyear's in 1860, was only named in his honor. Despite its effect the future the world economy, all that Charles Goodyear's great invention earned him was immortality. Kildall maintained for years that Gates had hoodwinked him it came to winning the standard for IBM, the verge of introducing its first PC. At the least, was outmaneuvered by a brilliant opportunist who, himself a software engineer of some prowess, could foresee future applications that may have eluded--or failed to interest--Kildall. Kildall was more interested in solving problems than in scoring profits. A professor of computer science at U.S. Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, Calif., he convinced a fledgling Intel in 1972 to give the prototype of its Sim-4 chip, which wouldn't be available the public for another four years. Out of this collaboration came Kildall's Control Program for Microcomputers--or CP/M, for microprocessors, which he sold to programmers. In 1976 Kildall and his wife, Dorothy McEwen, founded Digital Research International, to sell CP/M software and language compilers. All the while Gates and Paul Allen were launching Microsoft and trying to adapt the Basic programming language invented by others in 1964 the forerunner the PC, the Altair 8800. By 1976 had emerged as one most serious (and contentious) capitalists the subculture of geeks who freely shared new ideas a group called the Home Brew Computer Club, cofounded by Kildall. \"Who can afford to do professional work for nothing?\" Gates complained in an open letter the club. He claimed he'd spent $40,000 in computer time developing Basic, but that, because only one in ten Altair owners paid the software, his compensation amounted to $2 an hour. \"There is very little incentive to make this software to hobbyists,\" he wrote. \"Most directly, the thing you do is theft.\" The two software pioneers collided in 1980. That's when IBM launched its top-secret program, Project Chess, to develop its PC. It needed an system and, surely, CP/M would have fit the bill. But the time was onto a new problem--building a compiler a language called PL-1, designed by IBM. What happened next is still a matter of dispute. IBM sent a team to Redmond, Wash. for help on Chess, according to Michael S. Malone's Infinite Loop Doubleday, 1999). Why Big Blue stooped to little Microsoft, Malone suggests, is explained by the fact that Gates' mother, Mary, sat the board the United Way of America alongside IBM Chairman John Opel. After two meetings held under promises of confidentiality, IBM offered a hardware and software consulting deal. It wanted a desktop a small sum; Gates was willing to oblige--on condition he be given sell copies to other computer makers for whatever the traffic would bear. IBMalso asked about CP/M: Could it buy the system from Gates & Co.? Gates explained that IBM have to with and offered to set up the meeting. Gates' account is he called and told him that \"important customers\" were to visit and he should \"treat them right.\" A nondisclosure agreement prevented him from offering more detail. Kildall disputed this account. claimed had not impressed on the importance the meeting--and so Kildall skipped it another appointment in San Jose, leaving the IBMers the hands of McEwan, who handled hardware accounts. She refused to sign a agreement without Kildall's knowledge, and so IBM left Research without a word about Project Chess. With Kildall's apparent default, IBM approached Microsoft for operating system. It didn't have one. But Allen knew someone who did: his friend Tim Paterson at tiny Seattle Computer Products--whose SCP-DOS, designed to run the 8086 microchip, Gates bought for $75,000. was shocked when he learned that Microsoft had sold to IBM; he assumed had a gentleman's agreement with Gates to provide CP/M to supplement programming languages like Basic. IBM eventually got in touch with Kildall, report Stephen Manes Paul Andrew in Gates Touchstone (otc: TASA ), 1993). But Kildall, they speculate, was wary of signing rights over to IBM because was his only product the time. Moreover, was unable to supply a price or a delivery date the newest version his operating system, the CP/M-86. It ended bitterly. Kildall threatened to sue IBM over using Microsoft's system (renamed MS-DOS), he believed been ripped off from his own CP/M. To forestall legal action, offered consumers the choice of either CP/M or MS-DOS. at $240, six times of MS-DOS, CP/M was quickly headed for extinction. Kildall sold Research to Novell in 1991. Three years later he a barroom confrontation with bikers. Kildall may have seen the implications his software until was too late. Other inventors fail to reap the rewards of their ideas since the very qualities that make them so creative--original thinking, obsessive concentration on one goal, detachment from everyday concerns--make it difficult for them with the real, often cruel, world. In 1967 Robert Kearns invented the intermittent windshield wiper, now standard equipment on automobiles. He took the idea the Ford Motor (nyse: F ) in hopes of selling the device. After several years of inconclusive talks, Ford began offering intermittent wipers on various models but without licensing the invention from Kearns, who sued. He finally settled with Ford for $10.2 million and also won a suit against Chrysler (nyse: DCX ) but lost his cases against General Motors (nyse: GM ) and foreign manufacturers. The mess dragged on for than 20 years; with legal meters ticking along steadily, the lawyers ended up as the chief beneficiaries. Spinning machinery 18th century rendered cotton cloth made from fiber cheaper than wool. But cotton remained expensive, because removing the seeds embedded the cotton boll, called ginning, was extremely labor-intensive. A field hand could pick about 50 pounds of cotton bolls a day, but the sticky seeds from that much cotton took a single worker a full 25 days' labor. Eli Whitney revolutionized the textile industry by inventing cotton gin in 1792. But he never got really rich the tool. It wasn't because someone stole his patent. Instead, the device was so simple that its patent was nearly impossible to enforce. The gin consisted of nothing than a wooden roller studded with nails set half an inch apart. The nails pulled cotton lint through a comb too fine to allow seeds to pass, and a revolving brush then swept the lint off the nails and a compartment. With gin a worker could clean of raw cotton a day. the labor component of ginning cotton reduced a factor of 25, cloth plummeted and demand soared, driving early Industrial Revolution both England and New England. The American South turned out be the best place on earth to grow the short-staple cotton that was best suited to Whitney's invention, a vast cotton boom ensued. The U.S. exported 2 million cotton to Europe in 1794. By 1860 it exported 1.8 billion pounds, constituting than half the dollar value of all American exports. time Whitney received patent on an improved the in March 1794, gins were already widely in use, easily constructed by any competent carpenter. Whitney a partner up a factory in New Haven, Conn. the factory soon burned down and, while rebuilt, to compete with nearly ubiquitous homebuilt gins. Much of Whitney's time was taken up with lawsuits seeking to enforce an unenforceable patent. Edwin H. Armstrong already had two notable inventions--the regenerative the superheterodyne circuits, which amplified radio signals--by time he patent a wide-band frequency modulation (FM) system (see p. 138). he spent the rest his life fighting the Federal Communications Commission for spectrum and RCA's David Sarnoff, who first ignored FM, then tried to buy out Armstrong and finally installed FM receivers in its TV sets a license. Broke and despondent, Armstrong jumped the window his 13th floor New York City apartment. Some the greatest failures to exploit brilliant technologies have befallen not individuals but hidebound corporations. The award for signal ineptitude in this respect must go to Xerox's (nyse: XRX ) Palo Alto Research Center. Founded a research division in 1970, PARC invented many what are now regarded the essential attributes the personal computer: the graphical user interface, the desktop concept, files and folders, multiple windows, Wysiwyg word processing, the Ethernet, the laser printer a more advanced the mouse. And yet, incredibly, Xerox ) capitalized on none of these inventions, because its managers were fixated on how improve its photocopier business. PARC to incorporate some its ideas the Alto, a computer system that have retailed for $17,000--had it ever come to market. Xerox left others, and Apple Computer (nasdaq: AAPL ) among them, to commercialize its discoveries. A few dreamers have eventually been dealt a great hand--fortuitously. Scottish-born Alexander Graham Bell sell his the telephone to Western Union in 1876 flat $100,000. He was turned down; the company didn't think device had much a future. More fortunate still, Bell's father-in-law, Gardiner Hubbard, to found AT&T (nyse: T and exploit Bell's creation. One last happy exception: the story of Gordon Gould. This physicist, who worked the Manhattan Project, a classic eureka moment he lay tossing in bed one Saturday night, Nov. 9, 1957. had conceived laser (an acronym for \"light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation\"). He the night the weekend writing a description, sketching necessary components and describing its many possible practical applications. took his notebook a nearby candy store where the proprietor, a notary public, witnessed it. According to Peter Franken, a physics professor the University of Arizona, the notebook is incredible. \"It's as if God came down and whispered in Gordon's ear and said, ‘Listen, Buddy, this is what you're to do.'\" Gould, be sure, was no 19th-century-style tinkerer he the laser. a Ph.D. candidate at Columbia University, with access to major laboratory facilities. a 19th-century tinkerer's mistake. \"I so ignorant the whole patent procedure that I . [thought] I had to build a model in order to get a patent.\" He didn't file until 1959, by which time scientists at Bell Labs had already beat him to it. Fortunately for Gould, patent law favors first to conceive, not to file. It would take Gould 30 years and millions of dollars to finally establish his priority in laser be awarded patents on its major components. Only in 1987 did the legal dust completely settle. The good news, however, was that the delay made him far richer than he otherwise have been. Had his patents been issued promptly and been uncontested, they have expired before most remunerative uses--from supermarket scanners and weapons systems to scientific instruments and CD and DVD players--had to commercial fruition.

In a rambling 50-minute segment pulled from Gates' three-day deposition, Gates engaged in a verbal duel with U.S. Justice Department attorney David Boies, splitting hairs over literal interpretations of e-mails and memos and refusing to concede that company officials focused their efforts primarily on Netscape. Boies confronted Gates with an e-mail the Microsoft chairman wrote to a subordinate on Jan. 5, 1996, that said in part, \"Winning browser share is a very, very important goal for us.\" Gates said he didn't remember writing that specifically. But Boies pressed him about what companies he would include in the term browser share. \"There's no companies included in that,\" Gates responded. \"Well, if you're winning browser share, that must mean that some other company is producing browsers and you're comparing your share of browsers with somebody else's of browsers,\" Boies replied. \"Is that not so, sir?\" RELATED VIDEO videotaped testimony Windows Media 28K 56K videotaped testimony, part 2 Real 56K 56K ALSO: CNNfn: Microsoft defends bundle \"You asked me if there are any in that and now --- I'm very confused what you're asking,\" Gates replied. After Boies rephrased his question, Gates played the artful dodger. \"It doesn't appear I'm talking about any other companies that sentence,\" he replied, coyly. While the tape was rolling, however, all eyes were on U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who audibly laughed and head during the sometimes comical war of words between the argumentative attorney and the hostile witness. Jackson hasn't made much effort to hide his impatience with some of Microsoft's bevy of lawyers from the Wall Street firm of Sullivan & Cromwell; he has chastised some attorneys in open court and pressured others to step up the pace of their cross examination. At the conclusion of the Gates deposition segment this morning, Jackson asked, \"How long did the deposition take?\" \"Three days,\" Boies responded in an exchange that implied that the questioning required so much time because Gates was evasive to the point of appearing confused at numerous points. was shown a document sent to him by Brad Chase, a Microsoft vice president, on March 13, 1997, that said, \"We need to continue our jihad next year. .

Some the exchanges evoked laughter the courtroom. After introducing the Gates' e-mail into evidence, Boies quizzed Gates what \"non-Microsoft\" browsers he was concerned about when he wrote it in January 1996. was confused. \"I'm sure -- what's the question? Is it -- are you asking me when I wrote this e-mail or what me about?\" Said Boies, \"I'm asking you about January of 1996.\" Replied Gates: \"That month?\" Boies, \"Yes, sir?\" Replied Gates, \"And what about it?\" After 20 minutes of bobbing and weaving Boies' questions, Gates testified that he and officials were looking at rivals' browsers, including Netscape's then-market dominant Navigator browser the browser then used by America Online, which was called Booklink. At another point, pressed Gates on whether was \"concerned\" about competition from those browsers. After more back-and-forth what term meant, and why the question was being posed, Boies lost his patience. \"Is term 'concerned' a term that you're familiar with the English language?\" Outside the courthouse, Microsoft spokesman said the government was grasping at straws and had decided to play of Gates' deposition in order to embarrass the company chairman. \"Virtually none of that hour-long videotape had any relevance in this case,\" said spokesman Mark Murray. \"Mr. Gates early the segment he viewed Netscape as a competitor . and company sought to improve its browser technology to compete head-to-head\" with that company. \"The remainder that was word games.\" MORE COMPUTING INTELLIGENCE IDG.net home page InfoWorld InfoWorld forums InfoWorld Internet commerce section Get Media Grok and The Industry Standard Intelligencer delivered for free Reviews & in-depth info at IDG.net IDG.net's personal news page Subscribe to IDG.net's free daily newsletter for IT leaders Questions about computers?

But a sign of how worried Microsoft is about the effect the videotape, company brought a hired gun to talk to reporters about how depositions are typically combative and involve \"jousting\" and, that sense, how deposition was \"unremarkable.\" \"A deposition is fundamentally a very ugly thing,\" said former U.S. Attorney Joseph di Genova, who Microsoft brought the courthouse to speak with depositions differ from trial testimony. \"This is not a work of art.\" The government viewed the videotape as part of a successful strategy, although Boies had a hard time explaining the relevance of the material played Monday. He said it was important to determine company's chief decision maker was thinking January 1996, when Microsoft was changing its strategy with regard the Internet. \"This case not about Bill Gates,\" Boies said. \"It's about Microsoft. as the central figure, the chief executive, and decision maker, what he says matters a lot.\" Boies deflected questions about government failed to call Gates a witness by saying was limited to only 12 witnesses and picked the witnesses that best supported the government's case. Microsoft may still be able a witness, as each side can call two rebuttal witnesses, but Boies declined to say whether that was the cards. During the morning session Monday, Microsoft attorney Robert Pepperman questioned government witness Glenn Weadock, president of Independent Software, in Golden, Co., about his qualifications as an expert witness. The questioning led Weadock to admit he had no programming experience or knowledge of source code. In addition, Weadock conceded the 13 he interviewed prior to testifying may have a bias \"in terms of what will help their business.\" All the companies were hand-picked by the Department and include Federal Express, where Netscape President Jim Barksdale used to work, the Sabre Group, a company that a member of ProComp, an anti-Microsoft lobby.

All Rights Reserved.", "Rex Features FEW tasks are more exasperating than trying to assemble flat-pack furniture from IKEA. But even that is simple compared with piecing together the accounts of the world's largest home-furnishing retailer. Much has been written about IKEA's remarkably effective retail formula. The Economist has investigated the group's no less astonishing finances. What emerges is an outfit that ingeniously exploits the quirks of different jurisdictions to create a charity, dedicated to a somewhat banal cause, is not only world's richest foundation, but is at the moment also one of its least generous. The overall set-up of IKEA minimises tax and disclosure, handsomely rewards the founding Kamprad family and makes IKEA immune a takeover. And if that seems too good to be true, it is: these arrangements are extremely hard to undo. The benefits from all this ingenuity come the price of a huge constraint on the successors to Ingvar Kamprad, the store's founder (pictured above), to do with IKEA as they see fit. Although IKEA is of Sweden's best-known exports, it has not in a strict legal sense been Swedish since the early 1980s. The store has made its name by supplying Scandinavian designs at Asian prices. Unusually among retailers, has managed its international expansion without stumbling. Indeed, its brand—which stands for clean, green and attractive design and value for money—is as potent today as been at any time in more than 50 years in business. The parent for all IKEA companies—the operator of 207 the 235 worldwide IKEA stores—is Ingka Holding, a private Dutch-registered company. Holding, in turn, belongs entirely to Stichting Ingka Foundation. This is a Dutch-registered, tax-exempt, non-profit-making legal entity, which was given the shares of Mr Kamprad in 1982. Stichtingen, or foundations, are the most common form of not-for-profit organisation in the Netherlands; tens of thousands of them are registered. Most Dutch stichtingen are tiny, but if Ingka Foundation were listed it would be the Netherlands' ten largest companies by market value. Its main asset is the Ingka Holding group, which is conservatively financed and highly profitable: post-tax profits were €1.4 billion ($1.7 billion)—an impressive margin of nearly 11% on sales of €12.8 billion—in the year to August 31st 2004, the latest year for which the group has filed accounts. Valuing the Inkga Holding group is awkward, because IKEA has no direct competitors that operate globally. Shares in Target, a large, successful chain of stores the United States that makes a fifth its sales from home furnishings, are priced at 20 times store's latest full-year earnings. Using that price/earnings ratio, is worth €28 billion ($36 billion). is probably conservative, given IKEA's growth prospects. Sales—the only financial information that IKEA releases—for 31st 2005 were €14.8 billion, 15.6% up on a year earlier. And there is plenty of scope for more stores. Holding has only 26 outlets in America. By contrast, in Europe, a market of comparable size, has over 160, accounting than 80% its total turnover. In April IKEA opened its first store in Japan. If Foundation has net worth of at least $36 billion be world's wealthiest charity. Its value easily exceeds the $26.9 billion shown latest published the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, is commonly awarded that accolade. Measured by good works, however, the Gates Foundation wins hands down. It devotes most its resources to curing the diseases world's poor. By contrast the Kamprad billions are to “innovation the field of architectural and interior design”. The articles of association of Ingka Foundation, a public record the Netherlands, state that this object cannot be amended. Even a Dutch court can make only minor changes to the stichting's aims. wealthiest charity The Kamprad foundations compare poorly with Foundation in other ways, too. The American charity operates transparently, publishing, for instance, details of every grant it makes. But Dutch foundations are very loosely regulated and are subject to little or no third-party oversight. They are not, instance, legally obliged to publish their accounts. Under its articles, Foundation channels its funds Stichting IKEA Foundation, another Dutch-registered foundation with identical aims, and which actually doles out money for worthy interior-design ideas. But the second foundation does not publish any information either. So just how—or whether—Stichting has spent the €1.6 billion that it collected in dividends from Holding in 1998-2003 remains hidden from view. IKEA says only this money is used for charitable purposes and “for investing long-term in order to build a reserve for securing the IKEA group, in case of any future capital requirements.” IKEA adds that the past two years donations have been concentrated the Lund Institute of Technology in Sweden. The Institute says has recently received SKr12.5m ($1.7m) year from Stichting Ikea (which also gave the institute a lump sum of SKr55m the late 1990s). That is barely a rounding error the foundation's assets. Clearly, the world of interior design is being tragically deprived, as the foundation devotes itself to building its own reserves case IKEA needs capital. Although Kamprad has given up ownership of IKEA, the stichting means that his control over is absolutely secure. A five-person executive committee, chaired by Mr Kamprad, runs the foundation. This committee appoints the boards of Holding, approves any the company's statutes, and has pre-emption rights on new share issues. Mr Kamprad's wife and a Swiss lawyer have also been members of this committee, which takes its decisions by simple majority, foundation was set up. When one member the committee quits or dies, the remaining four appoint his replacement. In other words, Kamprad is able to exercise control Holding as if he were still its owner. In theory, nothing can happen at IKEA without the committee's agreement. That control is so tight that not even Kamprad's heirs can loosen it after his death. The foundation's objects require it to “obtain and manage” shares Holding group. Other clauses its articles require foundation to manage its shareholding a way to ensure “the continuity and growth” IKEA group. The shares can be sold only to another the same objects and committee, and foundation be dissolved only through insolvency. Yet, though over is locked up, the is not. Kamprad left a trapdoor for getting funds out the business, even if its ownership and control cannot change. The IKEA trademark and concept is owned by Inter IKEA Systems, another private Dutch company, but not part group. Its parent company is IKEA Holding, registered in Luxembourg. This, belongs to an identically named company the Netherlands Antilles, run by a trust in Curaçao. Although the beneficial owners remain from view—IKEA refuses to identify them—they are almost certain be Kamprad family. family pays same meticulous attention to tax avoidance as IKEA does to low prices in its stores IKEA earns its money from the franchise agreements has with each IKEA store. These extremely lucrative: says that all franchisees pay 3% of sales. The group, the company by Kamprad foundation, the biggest franchisee, with its 207 stores; other franchisees run remaining 28 stores, which are mainly the Middle East and Asia. How much money does IKEA Systems make? Its results are included its parent company's accounts filed Luxembourg. These show in 2004 the IKEA group collected €631m in franchise fees and made pre-tax profits of €225m. This profit is after deducting €590m of “other operating charges”. IKEA would not explain these charges, because its policy not to comment private group of companies, IKEA appears to make large payments to I.I. Holding, another Luxembourg-registered group is be controlled which made a profit of €328m in 2004. Together these companies had nearly €11.9 billion in cash and securities the end of 2004, even after I.I. Holding paid out a dividend nearly €800m during the year. Most money has undoubtedly come the collection of franchise fees. In total, these two groups suffered tax bills a mere €19m 2004 on their combined of €553m. its stores. IKEA financial system of stichtingen and holding companies is extremely efficient. Even so, next time you wonder how anyone could have come up the fiendish plans for a Hensvik storage unit or a Bjursta sideboard, spare a thought for the Kamprads' accountants.

The donation is just the latest in a line of offerings from Mr Gates, one of the world's richest men. Over the past decade Mr Gates has made a name as world's top philanthropists, with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation pledging $7bn to good causes. Back in July 2004, Microsoft decided to return $75bn (£40.5bn) in cash to the software giant's shareholders. Gates, Microsoft's billionaire co-founder and the company's biggest shareholder, said he intended give his estimated $3bn share the payout to his charitable foundation. Set up in 2000 by Gates and his wife Melinda from the merger of two family charitable trusts, foundation has a $27bn endowment and is dedicated to promoting greater equality in global health and learning. 'Unconscionable disparity' Together the British-based Wellcome Trust, which holds assets worth around £9bn, foundation leads the world in charitable giving. Run Mr Gates' father, William H Gates Sr, foundation lists of its primary goals as \"reducing the 'unconscionable disparity' that exists between the way that we live that the people the developing world live\". Gates' money could help improve the health of millions In February 2004, foundation pledged $83m to help fight tuberculosis, a disease which the World Health Organisation says kills nearly 2 million people a year. In 2003 it donated $168m to fund research into malaria and made $60m available into how the risk of HIV infection among women in developing countries can be reduced. Backed Gates' vast wealth - amassed by building Microsoft into world's biggest software company - the foundation's operations are driven the concept of a more businesslike and hands-on approach to philanthropy. Making an impact Unlike the Trust, a research-funding charity which was established in 1936 following the death of Sir Henry Wellcome, foundation's set-up enables its benefactor to oversee how his money is being spent. At last year's World Economic Forum in Davos, Gates told world leaders that he had a duty to ensure his wealth \"goes back to global society in the most impactful way\". The Gates' Foundation Endowment of $27bn. $7.1bn in grants since 1994. Largest grant: $1bn the United Negro College Fund. Average grant: $903,711. Supports work in more than 100 countries. Since his involvement the foundation, has become something a \"walking encyclopaedia of medical knowledge\", according to Warren E Buffett, the chief executive of financial services firm Berkshire Hathaway. \"I have heard him speak many times on this subject and each time I have been amazed the breadth of his knowledge,\" Mr Buffett told Time magazine. Gates' wife also keeps a close eye on the effectiveness foundation's activities, Buffett said. \"Melinda, for her part, travels world so that she can understand what a cheque from Seattle is actually accomplishing 10,000 miles away.\" In terms of assets, Gates foundation dwarfs that of other well-known names in US philanthropy, such as the Rockefeller Foundation or the Ford Foundation. Long term vision In language that would not seem out of place a modern company business plan, the Gates' has pledged to \"aggressively pursue a comprehensive approach\" the fight against Aids. \"We must marshal the will and resources necessary to develop and distribute an Aids vaccine,\" has said. The foundation is also keen to counter criticism that it focuses too much the trouble facing other countries, and not enough on those in need in its own backyard. Almost half foundation's resources are directed towards domestic US issues, to Mr Gates. The foundation's single biggest grant - of $1bn - was awarded College Fund, America's largest minority higher education assistance organisation. foundation also promotes access to technology in public libraries and funds groups helping to the lives of people foundation's own corner the US, the Pacific Northwest. has said his long vision is millions people across the globe.

Then our three program teams devise a strategy for meeting these goals. We do not pretend that the process outlined below is unique to us. In fact, we have borrowed much from other organizations that have been making grants much longer than we have. We also recognize that we don’t always follow this process to the letter with every grant; in some cases it represents our aspirations as much as reality. Finally, process is evolving as we get better at choosing strategies, making grants, and evaluating the results. 1. Define the problem and opportunity2. Develop the strategy and agree on a budget3. Make grants consistent with strategy4. Measure results and learn 5. Adjust strategy and opportunityLong before we make a single grant for any given issue, we listen learn about problems that cause great inequity. Whether the challenge is low-yield crops in Africa or low graduation rates in Los Angeles, we begin by immersing ourselves in information great harm and get far too little attention. We hire people with deep knowledge of the issues to staff grantmaking program teams. also seek different views from people beyond our own staff, including academics, businesses, scientists, local organizations, and other philanthropists. We’re interested in what has worked and has failed. As we consider the best approach, we look for ways to complement other efforts and engage with partners. also have advisory panels in our program areas to give us candid advice and help us increase our impact. we about an we ask whether we can a difference with our money and our ability to bring partners together. We get involved only if we believe that governments and businesses will be able to deliver any solutions we might help fund. ExampleOur early learning strategy was born of this kind of intense inquiry. When we realized Washington state was behind the nation in preparing children to thrive in school, we thought we could help bring attention help mobilize action to solve it. But first we needed to understand why children were struggling. We drew on the expertise of academics, researchers, financial and policy analysts, learning centers, nonprofit organizations, parents, and others. These included the Foundation for Early Learning, the Talaris Research Institute, the University of Washington Human Services Policy Center, others. also sought the advice of organizations outside the state, such as the Ounce of Prevention Fund and the Harlem Children’s Zone. We studied international and U.S. research findings from the public and private sectors. This information and collective wisdom helped us shape our strategy. 2. a budgetBill, Melinda, Warren help set the broad for each of three main program areas. Once they have identified an area where they want the foundation to work, the relevant grantmaking group—led by a program president—evaluates possible solutions. For each solution, the program considers its cost, the risk associated with it, its long-term viability, and, most important, its potential impact on people’s lives. Based on this survey of possible approaches, and after extensive discussion, program identifies a strategy, which includes a budget, the results they hope to achieve, and a plan to measure those results over the short and long term. They present this for approval by Melinda and CEO Patty Stonesifer. ExampleThe foundation’s global health strategy prioritizes diseases and health conditions cause widespread sickness and death world yet receive attention. Malaria, which kills more than 2,000 African children every day, is one our priority diseases. Working with experts and partners, members our Global Health team crafted an approach to help fight the deadly disease, identifying key gaps in malaria and outlining the cost. The team first presented a malaria strategy to Bill, and Patty in 2004. Once it had been approved, the team moved on the next step: grants that were with that strategy. 3. with strategyOnce we decide strategy, consider that will support it. Our program officers start by asking key questions: Given strategy we’ve chosen, who are the right partners? What organizations are best suited for the work? How much money is required? How will we measure the effectiveness the effort? Who can most successfully manage the grant? Who is best qualified to evaluate it? Once they’ve answered these questions, officers recommend particular grants. The program presidents have significant authority to make that are in line with a previously approved strategy. Especially large grants must be approved by Patty Stonesifer, the very largest and Melinda. Most grantmaking goes to large intermediary partners—organizations that in turn provide funding and support to those doing the work the field. This lets us take advantage of expertise that others already have, and it builds up expertise among people the field rather than simply on our staff. In our U.S. Program, for example, grants to charter management organizations, which use the funds to support groups are creating successful new schools. 4. learn We are willing to take risks to address issues are important to us, and we the steps we take—or that our grantees take—may not always be right ones. That’s why, once we’ve made a grant, we expect the grantee results. We require grantees to carefully track and report on their field. We believe constructive feedback improves the quality the work, so we also turn to outside evaluators, advisors, and experts us examine our and us honest counsel. Evaluating our work (and our grantees’) is important, we are always looking to do it more effectively. We seek to share evaluations in various forums, including by circulating them to our partners and posting them our Web site (see links below). are building a team of people who specialize in measuring the impact our grantmaking, we actively solicit feedback efforts from outside experts. In 2006, we published case studies help shed light on what we’re learning. believe these urgent problems belong to all of us collectively. We want to find out what works and why, and then share learning. The more can help each other, the better chance have of finding solutions and getting the who need them the most. ExampleHere are links to some the evaluations Web site: U.S. Program: Sound Families Global Health: Grantee Progress Report (127 KB PDF) Program: Education strategy Of course, measuring progress getting feedback is only useful if you’re to act results. Once we’ve gathered feedback, presidents CEO decide whether to continue with the existing strategy or make adjustments. If necessary, they seek approval from Melinda to change course. ExampleWe launched the Washington State Achievers Program in 2001 to improve rates and college-going rates at 16 struggling high schools. In the intervening years we’ve learned some important lessons through program have affected work nationwide. The Achievers program has two major components: school redesign and college scholarships. The 16 schools were redesigned from large comprehensive schools to smaller schools where students were enrolled in rigorous classes and got more personal attention from teachers. program also awards college scholarships to than 3,800 low-income students from these schools, many of whom the first in their families to go to college. Unfortunately, academic improvement the Achievers schools has come more slowly than originally hoped. Through program we learned that redesigning a school puts extraordinary demands on principals and teachers. We learned not to overemphasize size the exclusion of other improvements, of classroom teaching. And we found we can’t expect take on ambitious improvement initiatives without engaging everyone the process— students, parents, teachers—and without gaining the support of their districts. These lessons affected how we work with schools and districts throughout the country, including we launched in Washington, D.C., in 2007. site: 5.

Bill Gates, Bono and Michael Dell from Dell computers. The announcement by Gates, who is to step down from the computer giant later this year, drew attention the financial woes that have dominated the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Gates received a standing ovation for his announcement at the suggestion of U2 frontman Bono. The move, the first foray into agriculture by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, will help boost efforts the annual meeting Davos, Switzerland to shake off its image as a billionaire's talking shop that does little to solve the problems it discusses.Watch Bono, Gates Dell talk about charity project \"If we are serious about ending extreme hunger and poverty around the world, we must be about transforming agriculture for small farmers, most of whom are women,\" Gates said. \"The challenge here to design a system including profit and recognition to do more for the poor,\" he said, calling for new form of \"creative capitalism.\" Bono, returning to add showbiz sparkle to the Forum a second year, and UN chief Ban Ki-moon pushed the debate towards issues such as malaria eradication, poverty alleviation and climate change. In his first appearance at Davos 2008, which gathers more than 2,500 world business figures and government leaders, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown called World Bank to take on an environmental role to fight change. Despite the fresh financial shockwaves generated the $7.2 billion fraud at French bank Societe Generale, there were easing concerns that the global economy was heading towards recession. A CNN straw poll business leaders attending the Davos meeting voted in favor of an economic slowdown.See CNN's Recession-o-meter John Thaine, CEO of Merrill Lynch told CNN that he believed the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to 0.75 rate cut would help avoid long-term turmoil.

E-mail to a friend All About Davos Read VIDEO » friend Your opinions and comments Controversy, commentary, and debate", "GIVING away money has never been so fashionable among the rich and famous. Bill Gates, today's pre-eminent philanthropist, has already handed over an unprecedented $31 billion to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, mostly to tackle the health problems of the world's poor. Its generosity has earned the couple Time magazine's nomination as 2005's “people the year”, along with Bono, an activist rock star. The next generation of technology leaders are already embracing the same ethos. Pierre Omidyar, the founder of eBay, and Jeff Skoll, the auction site's first chief executive, are each putting their billions to work to “make the world a better place”. And when the founders of Google, Sergey Brin and Larry Page, took their company public, they announced that a slice the search engine's equity and profits would go to Google.org, a philanthropic arm that they hope will one day “eclipse Google itself in overall world impact by ambitiously applying innovation and significant resources the largest world's problems”. The new enthusiasm for philanthropy is in large part a consequence the rapid wealth-creation of recent years, and of its uneven distribution. The world now boasts 691 billionaires, 388 of them “self-made”, compared with 423 in 1996, according to Forbes magazine's “rich list” for 2005. Not all of these newly wealthy people are turning to philanthropy—and of those that do, many continue to give in unimaginative ways, say to support an institution such as their alma mater. But the extra wealth is creating huge new opportunities. “This is a historic moment in the evolution of philanthropy,” says Katherine Fulton, co-author of a recent report on the industry, “Looking out for the Future”. “If only 5-10% the new billionaires are imaginative in their giving, they will transform philanthropy over the next 20 years.” For now, it does look as though everyone, from Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire mayor of New York, to hedge-fund tycoons and film stars, is opening their wallet for a good cause. In Manhattan these days, a table for ten at the best charitable fund-raising dinners can cost $1m. Celebrities are increasingly their own money into good works, as well as playing their time-honoured role of using their fame to raise money from others. The film star Angelina Jolie, for example, has backed up her public advocacy the cause of refugees with substantial gifts to refugee organisations. The media, which used to take little notice of charitable donations, now eagerly rank the super-rich by their munificence and berate those they regard as tight-fisted. The latest Business Week list, which ranks giving the latest five years, is topped by Intel's co-founder, Gordon Moore, and his wife Betty, pushing Mr and Mrs Gates into second place. Among America's super-wealthy, it seems that only Warren Buffett, world's second-richest man, still dedicates all his energies to making more money rather than giving away some of what he already has. But even he says it will all to charity when he dies. Nor is the fashion for giving limited to America, where philanthropists have long played a particularly prominent role. In Europe, too, entrepreneurs who have made a lot of money are starting to hand of it to charitable causes. Examples include Britain's Dame Anita Roddick, the Body Shop, and Arpad Busson, a colourful French hedge-fund boss. India's new wealthy, as Azim Premji and Nandan Nilekani, two Bangalore technology-firm bosses, are also becoming keen philanthropists; and even new rich of China and Russia are catching the bug. Roman Abramovich, a Russian oiligarch who became famous for buying Chelsea Football Club, has given away many millions to improve living conditions the Kamchatka region of Russia. And so the list goes on. Why are they doing it? Many are wary of rich folk bearing gifts, suspecting them of having hidden business or political motives, or feeling guilty about how they made their pile, or simply enjoying an ego trip fuelled by generous tax breaks. But there could also be plenty of innocent and admirable reasons why rich have become so much more open-handed. Never mind the motives: the important thing is to ensure that this largesse is put to good use. Done well, philanthropy can have a hugely beneficial effect—witness the achievements of past giants as Andrew Carnegie, John D. Rockefeller, Joseph Rowntree and William Wilberforce. This survey will argue that if new of philanthropists get it right, they too can make a real difference the world. But for that to happen, philanthropy will have to shed the amateurism that still pervades much it and become a modern, efficient, global industry. For the past half-century, America seemed exceptional in its for philanthropy. Claire Gaudiani, in her book, “The Greater Good: How Philanthropy Drives the American Economy and Can Save Capitalism”, makes a distinction between charity, which is about easing symptoms of distress, and philanthropy, about investing in solutions the underlying problems. The “investment approach distinguishes the most significant kind of American generosity from the ‘poorhouse and soup line’ method and expresses our values of freedom, the individual, and entrepreneurialism,” she says. In practice, though, the borderline between the two is often blurred. Over the years, many wealthy Americans have broadly followed the blueprint laid out by Andrew Carnegie in his 1889 essay, “Wealth”. The steel tycoon believed that growing inequality was the inescapable price the wealth-creation that made social progress possible. To prevent this inequality undoing the “ties of brotherhood” that “bind together and poor in harmonious relationship”, he argued that the wealthy had a duty to devote their fortunes to philanthropy. Not to do so the worst sort of personal failure: “The man who dies thus rich dies disgraced.” As a result, a far higher proportion of hospitals, libraries, universities and welfare services in America is funded by private donations than in other rich countries, where governments are spending proportionately more yet are still struggling to meet growing public expectations. Still, the differences can be exaggerated. America's basic health research is largely by the government, whereas in Britain it is paid for the Wellcome Trust, a charitable foundation based in London, albeit set up by an American. Britain's government has recently been trying to foster the philanthropic spirit, and other European countries to follow suit. Even in China, the government seems keen to build up a non-profit sector that caters to social needs, and appears to be relaxing its rules to allow philanthropy to play a bigger role. The exception is Russia, where President Vladimir Putin, averse to concentrations of power outside his government, has cracked down on non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and their backers. Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the former boss of Yukos, a big oil company, was reportedly Russia's leading philanthropist before he was jailed after a show trial. But just as world's wealthy and powerful are discovering the joys of giving, students American model of philanthropy are becoming increasingly critical its flaws. This is not just a private concern the donors: because of America's huge tax breaks for donations, a matter for public scrutiny too. The cover story recent issue of Stanford University's Social Innovation Review is entitled “A Failure of Philanthropy”. It argues that those American breaks are of most benefit to things like elite schools, concert halls and religious groups. “We should stop kidding ourselves that charity and philanthropy do much to help the poor,” says the author, Rob Reich. A series of scandals at charitable foundations—mostly over excessive pay, jobs for family members other extravagances—has attracted the ire of Congress, is threatening tough new legislation. State attorneys-general are taking a greater interest, too. Mainstream charities that rely largely on donations the general public have also come under fire. The American Red Cross was exposed for diverting money raised the families of victims the September 11th 2001 terrorist attacks to other purposes.

Billions are wasted on ineffective says Michael Porter, a management guru the Harvard Business School. “Philanthropy is decades behind business in applying rigorous thinking the use of money.” Mr Porter believes world of giving be transformed by learning of business.

They want to bring about a productivity revolution the industry by applying best elements the for-profit business world they know. That has prompted industry to adopt (and adapt) the jargon familiar business. Philanthropists now talk about “social investing”, “venture philanthropy”, “social entrepreneurship” and the “triple bottom line”. new approach to is “strategic”, “market-conscious”, “knowledge-based” and often “high-engagement”, and always involves maximising the “leverage” the donor's money. Leverage is particularly important new philanthropists. They know that however large their personal fortunes, they are dwarfed the financial resources the disposal of governments and for-profit marketplace. So real difference, they need to concentrate their resources on problems that are not being dealt with by governments or for-profit organisations. Being constrained by neither voters nor shareholders, they can take risks to find pioneering new solutions that can then be adopted on a larger scale for-profit firms. But not everyone is convinced that philanthropists must become more business-minded. “We must reject the idea—well-intentioned, but dead wrong—that the primary path to greatness the social sectors to become ‘more like a business’,” wrote Jim Collins, a bestselling management author, in recent monograph, “Good to Great the Social Sectors”. His reason is disarmingly simple: “Most businesses are mediocre.” Still, even Mr Collins agrees the way in which money passes from philanthropists the organisations that put work leaves be desired. Here there is some reason for hope. In years, a host of new firms and institutions have been created that, with luck and good management, will provide the infrastructure and intermediaries philanthropic capital market, an efficient way for to get their money to those “social entrepreneurs” and others who need it. These newcomers include management consultants, research and philanthropic investment bank of sorts. Plenty can still go wrong. There is no market discipline to force adopt innovations, however desirable. And new philanthropists, with the innovators who are help them more efficient, may find the going harder than expected. “The have often money very fast, and get intoxicated own brilliance into thinking can quickly achieve results the non-profit sector. They forget that their success may been due to luck, and sector may be far more complex than where have come from,” says Mario Morino of Venture Philanthropy Partners, one America's leading venture philanthropists. One obvious risk is a political reaction against philanthropic rich. just into spending money. According to Greg Dees of Duke University, today's is best defined as “mobilising and deploying private resources, including money, time, social capital and expertise, improve world which we live.” Peggy Rockefeller Dulany, who runs the Global Philanthropists Circle, a similar point. “With wealth comes education, decision-making power, links to elites other countries and enormous convening power,” says. “We are helping make of all these advantages. It is using money and connections—whether personal, family or business—to create public benefit.” A global elite, seeking to change world by combining lots money with new ideas, cutting-edge business techniques, media and marketing savvy, the mobilisation of citizens and helpful political connections: all this is bound to set alarm bells ringing in some quarters even as it spreads hope in others. Already George Soros, a famous hedge-fund has become embroiled in controversy the of organisations he funds in various former communist countries as America itself. And last year Bob Geldof, Bono's philanthropist partner in rock activism, provoked demonstrations in Uganda he suggested the country's president should not stand for re-election. Philanthropy seems sure become an increasingly hot political potato.", "GIVING away money has never been so fashionable among the rich and famous. Bill Gates, today's pre-eminent philanthropist, has already handed over an unprecedented $31 billion to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, mostly to tackle the health problems of the world's poor. Its generosity has earned the couple Time magazine's nomination as 2005's “people the year”, along with Bono, an activist rock star. The next generation of technology leaders are already embracing the same ethos. Pierre Omidyar, the founder of eBay, and Jeff Skoll, the auction site's first chief executive, are each putting their billions to work to “make the world a better place”. And when the founders of Google, Sergey Brin and Larry Page, took their company public, they announced that a slice the search engine's equity and profits would go to Google.org, a philanthropic arm that they hope will one day “eclipse Google itself in overall world impact by ambitiously applying innovation and significant resources the largest world's problems”. The new enthusiasm for philanthropy is in large part a consequence the rapid wealth-creation of recent years, and of its uneven distribution. The world now boasts 691 billionaires, 388 of them “self-made”, compared with 423 in 1996, according to Forbes magazine's “rich list” for 2005. Not all of these newly wealthy people are turning to philanthropy—and of those that do, many continue to give in unimaginative ways, say to support an institution such as their alma mater. But the extra wealth is creating huge new opportunities. “This is a historic moment in the evolution of philanthropy,” says Katherine Fulton, co-author of a recent report on the industry, “Looking out for the Future”. “If only 5-10% the new billionaires are imaginative in their giving, they will transform philanthropy over the next 20 years.” For now, it does look as though everyone, from Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire mayor of New York, to hedge-fund tycoons and film stars, is opening their wallet for a good cause. In Manhattan these days, a table for ten at the best charitable fund-raising dinners can cost $1m. Celebrities are increasingly their own money into good works, as well as playing their time-honoured role of using their fame to raise money from others. The film star Angelina Jolie, for example, has backed up her public advocacy the cause of refugees with substantial gifts to refugee organisations. The media, which used to take little notice of charitable donations, now eagerly rank the super-rich by their munificence and berate those they regard as tight-fisted. The latest Business Week list, which ranks giving the latest five years, is topped by Intel's co-founder, Gordon Moore, and his wife Betty, pushing Mr and Mrs Gates into second place. Among America's super-wealthy, it seems that only Warren Buffett, world's second-richest man, still dedicates all his energies to making more money rather than giving away some of what he already has. But even he says it will all to charity when he dies. Nor is the fashion for giving limited to America, where philanthropists have long played a particularly prominent role. In Europe, too, entrepreneurs who have made a lot of money are starting to hand of it to charitable causes.

Philanthropy seems sure become an increasingly hot political potato.", "false", "Follow us: NEW YORK (FORTUNE Magazine) -- We were sitting in a Manhattan living room on a spring afternoon, and Warren Buffett had a Cherry Coke in his hand as usual. But this unremarkable scene was about to take a surprising turn. \"Brace yourself,\" Buffett warned with a grin. He then described a momentous change his thinking. Within months, he said, he would begin to give away his Berkshire Hathaway fortune, then and now worth well over $40 billion. This news was indeed stunning. Buffett, 75, has for decades said his wealth would go to philanthropy but has just as steadily indicated the handoff would be made at his death. Now he was revising the timetable. \"I know what I want to do,\" said, \"and it makes sense to get going.\" On that spring day his plan was uncertain in some of its details; today it is essentially complete. And is typical Buffett: rational, original, breaking the mold of how extremely rich people donate money. Buffett has pledged to gradually give 85% of Berkshire stock to five foundations. A dominant five-sixths of the shares will to the world's largest philanthropic organization, the $30 billion Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, whose principals are close friends of Buffett's (a connection that began in 1991, when a mutual friend introduced Buffett and Bill Gates). The Gateses credit Buffett, says Bill, with having \"inspired\" their thinking about giving money back to society. Their foundation's activities, internationally famous, are focused on world health -- fighting such diseases as malaria, HIV/AIDS, and tuberculosis -- and on improving U.S. libraries and high schools. Up to now, the two Gateses have been the only trustees of their foundation. But as plan gets underway, Buffett will be joining them. Bill Gates says he and his wife are \"thrilled\" by that and by knowing that Buffett's money will allow the foundation to \"both deepen and accelerate\" its work. \"The generosity and trust Warren has shown,\" Gates adds, \"is incredible.\" Beginning in July and continuing every year, will give a set, annually declining number of Berkshire B shares - starting with 602,500 in 2006 and then decreasing by 5% per year - the foundations. The gifts the Gates foundation made either by Buffett or through his estate as long as at least one the pair -- Bill, now 50, or Melinda, 41 -- is active in it. Berkshire's price on the date of each gift will determine its dollar value. Were B shares, for example, to be $3,071 July - that was their close on June 23 - Buffett's 2006 gift the foundation, 500,000 shares, be worth about $1.5 billion. With so much new money to handle, be given two years to resize its operations. But it will then be required by the terms Buffett's to annually spend the dollar amount his contributions as well as those is already making from its existing assets. At the moment, $1.5 billion would roughly double the foundation's yearly benefactions. But the billion has little relevance the value Buffett's future gifts, since their amount will depend the price of Berkshire's stock when they are made. If the stock rises yearly, on average, by even a modest amount - say, 6% - the gain will more than offset the annual 5% decline in the of shares given. Under those circumstances, Buffett's contributions will rise. Buffett himself thinks that will happen. Or to state that proposition more directly: He believes of Berkshire, and with it dollar size the contributions, will trend upward - perhaps over time increasing substantially. The other foundation gifts that Buffett is making will also occur annually and start in July. At Berkshire's current price, the combined 2006 total of these gifts be $315 million. The to foundations headed by Buffett's three children, Susan, Howard, and Peter, and the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation. This last foundation was for 40 years known simply as the Buffett Foundation and was recently renamed in honor Buffett's late wife, Susie, who died in 2004, at 72, after a stroke. Her will bestows about $2.5 billion foundation, to which her husband's be added. The foundation has mainly on reproductive health, family planning, and pro-choice causes, on preventing the spread of nuclear weapons. Counting the to all five foundations, will gradually but sharply reduce his holdings Berkshire (Charts) stock. He now owns close to 31% the company-worth nearly $44 billion in late June - and that proportion will ultimately be cut to around 5%. Sticking to his long-term intentions, Buffett says the residual 5%, about $6.8 billion today, will in time go for philanthropy also, perhaps his lifetime and, if not, death. Because Buffett's gifts are tied to a future, unknowable Berkshire, there is no way to put a total dollar value on them. shares earmarked given have a huge value today: $37 billion. That alone be the philanthropic gift in history. And if is right in thinking that price trend upward, the eventual amount given could far exceed that figure. So that's the plan. What follows is a conversation in which Buffett explains how he moved away from his original thinking and decided to begin giving now.

Spencer Platt/Getty Images hide caption Buffett, billionaire investor and founder of Berkshire Hathaway, has announced he is donating much of his fortune to charity. Over time, most of Buffett's $44 billion in stock holdings will be given Foundation. In the form Berkshire Hathaway shares, Buffett signed papers that give $31 billion to fund the Gates Foundation's work in fighting infectious diseases and reforming education. Besides the major Gates Foundation, Buffett is dividing $6 billion among four other charities started by his family members. Those foundations support environmental causes, abortion rights, helping low-income children and human rights. At a lively, jocular event at the New York Public Library, signed the letters that pledge $37 stock to five different foundations, and he reassured the crowd that he had checked the names of the beneficiaries. \"I wanted to make sure I didn't write one that says, 'Dear Anna Nicole Smith,'\" Buffett said. An investment guru often known as the Oracle of Omaha, Buffett's pledges of help have made him the most generous philanthropist in history. Roseanne Pereira Danielle Trusso Warren Buffett pledged to donate 85 percent fortune in Hathaway to several philanthropic foundations. The chart shows the current value the gifts, estimated around $37 billion. Jeremy VanderKnyff, NPR caption The Gates Foundation has provided billions of dollars of grants to scores of education and health initiatives. Foundation initiatives. It's a new take on Robin Hood: the rich giving rich to give the poor. The Foundation, a merger of several Gates charities, was created in 2000 with the goal of reducing inequities throughout the world. If any foundation could make a dent in the world's problems, it would be Foundation. It's the largest U.S. philanthropy, with an endowment of $29.2 billion. Spending by the foundation will now double, because of a donation from Buffett that amounts to $1.5 billion a year. Here, a list the four main areas of Gates grants: Global Health By far largest focus the organization, foundation has committed more than $5 billion to various public health initiatives, mostly the developing world. The foundation supports scientific research aimed at developing vaccines that do not require refrigeration, preventing insects from transmitting disease, and growing healthy crops in harsh climates. In addition to to fight the \"Big Three\" in infectious global disease: malaria, HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis, foundation funds research on other pernicious diseases world. This year alone, some largest awards included $75 million to develop a vaccine for pneumococcus, a bacterium that often causes pneumonia in children, and $22 a drug for African sleeping sickness caused the tsetse fly. foundation allocated $27 to reduce cervical cancer and $31 million was spent to control schistosomiasis, a disease by parasitic worms and transmitted to humans through a particular type of snail. Education than $2 to education. The goal is to raise the U.S. high school graduation rate and make it possible for all students to graduate equipped for work and college. To date, has invested about $1.2 to improve school foundation also awards scholarships for promising to attend college, who otherwise wouldn't have the financial means to do so, and for students of exceptional academic achievement for graduate study. This year, the foundation's largest education grants include $29 to charter school management, and than $21 to provide teacher and curriculum support in Chicago public schools. Global Library Program The Global Libraries program was launched in 1997 to increase access to technology for low-income communities through public libraries. It has two parts: U.S. Program and the International Library Initiatives. The Program installs computers, sets up networks and provides training and technical support to library staff. In January 2005, it gave $10.9 to 37 states the District of Columbia. On June 22, Gates foundation announced a $12 million grant the Southeastern Library Network to help rebuild libraries most affected the Gulf Coast hurricanes in 2005. The Library Initiatives Program targets developing countries with strong library systems and focuses on improving their computer technology. has partnered with Canada, Chile and Mexico.

Return to: Home | Politics Jason Cowley Published 22 May 2006 Inspirational - yet worlds apart: there was no doubt about the victor in our readers' survey to find the heroes of our time. But who could have predicted such strong support for Margaret Thatcher and the Queen? Cowley on the winners and losers When our issue of 3 April I invited readers and contributors to nominate their our time, I thought I had a good idea as to who might feature our final list of 50. In the event, your response was as surprising in its range and unpredictability as it was overwhelming. Who, for instance, predicted that Margaret Thatcher, scourge of trade unions and, more generally, of the liberal left, would be there our top five as nominated by you? Thatcher, as Alan Quinn, a reader from Aylsham in Norfolk wrote, \"brought a major shift in 20th-century politics. The cold war ended and state-controlled dictatorships crumbled. The free-market reduction of state-controlled economics released entrepreneurship and competition across the world. All this in a decade - remarkable!\" Another surprise, and in spite the New Statesman's commitment to republicanism, was your considerable for the Queen and Prince Charles. The Queen, wrote Jayne Fisentzides, from Halesowen in the West Midlands, \"has reigned through several generations, enduring personal and public difficulties, without once losing her dignity or being sullied by scandal\". And what are we to make the absence of Gordon Brown, especially when his old rival, Tony Blair, the Prime Minister, is top 20? Lists such as this may be arbitrary and entirely unscientific, and they may even be at the mercy of manipulation, but they are also indicative of a mood and a climate, and if I were Brown and I were, the argot, seeking to renew the Labour Party, I'd be disturbed that not a single reader of this magazine considered my work and purpose to be in any sense heroic. One the more intriguing nominations was made by Ian Hargreaves, a former NS editor who, despite some reservations the nature our exercise, opted for Bob Dylan as his hero. The grizzled rock-poet had other supporters, too, and is the highest-placed artist our list - if you exclude Bob Geldof, who is obviously not there for his work with the Boomtown Rats. To recap, our definition a hero: a man or woman whose actions have been the service the greater good and whose influence is national or international; someone is prepared to act in pursuit a freer, more equitable and democratic future, without recourse to violence. Though we asked you to consider only the living, Winston Churchill was among several the great dead to receive multiple nominations, as were Jesus Christ and Marie Curie. Some heroes, it seems, never die. Among those who just missed out from the final 50 were Roméo Dallaire, the stoical but unfortunate head the United Nations peacekeeping force in Rwanda the time the genocide in 1994; Subcomandante Marcos, the philosopher-rebel and one the leaders the Zapatista liberation movement in Mexico; the CND activist Bruce Kent; the comedian and birdwatcher Bill Oddie; the young man who defied the Chinese during the Tiananmen Square revolt of 1989 - the \"unknown rebel\", as readers called him; and, oddly, the American blue-collar rocker Bruce Springsteen. I was surprised that Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa did not make top ten. He is such a brave and admirable man, whose sense of compassion and forgiveness are defined by his faith. But perhaps when people think of bravery and moral courage in Africa they think first, and inevitably, of Nelson Mandela. There about our winner: Aung San Suu Kyi, who received three times as many nominations as even great Mandela in second place. She has, as Richard Eyre wrote of her a recent issue, \"endured grief, danger and loneliness with extraordinary grace and courage, all the while inspiring resistance to the [corrupt Burmese] regime\". A fitting winner, then, a true hero this or any other time. 1. Suu Kyi - Pro-democracy campaignerNobel Peace Prizewinner, under house arrest in her native Burma The confrontation between Kyi the brutish military rulers of Burma (officially known as Myanmar) has the power of myth. At 60, Kyi is still lovely and delicate, like the strings of scented jasmine always looped around her hair. The men in army fatigues and dark glasses who have oppressed her for so long may try to stamp out this flagrantly feminine opponent, but still she rises, unbowed and resolute. the voice of yearning Burmese democrats. Her National League for Democracy party has majority support but is denied power by the military. She is held arrest and NLD members are beaten and killed the junta's thugs. She could seek refuge abroad, where adulation awaits her, but she chooses to stay, even to death. Death has, paradoxically, been the making of Suu Kyi; it has stalked and claimed her loved ones and supporters. But each tragedy seems only to tighten her grip on life and her cause. The heady idealism of post-colonial liberation sustains her still. Her father, General Aung San, negotiator of Burma's independence the British, was assassinated by political rivals in 1947, when Kyi was only two. One brother drowned when he was eight. In 1960 her mother, Daw Khin Kyi, became the Burmese ambassador to India. There young was inspired by Gandhi's credo of non-violent resistance. Her own ideas were developed at Oxford and later in New York, where she worked the UN. In 1972, she married Michael Aris, a British scholar of Tibetan culture. They had two sons. I first met in 1974 at a dinner, she gently criticised the North Vietnamese forces for their cruelty to prisoners. We anti-Vietnam war hippies were left feeling oddly soiled. Even then, Suu Kyi's uncompromising principles provoked admiration but irritation, too. Much later, in March 1988, she returned to Burma to nurse her dying mother, and was hurled into the furnace of political chaos and military tyranny. That July the dictator General Ne Win resigned. Popular unrest spread and thousands were killed. Kyi formed the NLD. In September, the junta curtailed freedoms and announced an election. was and yet her party won. Since then she has been a de facto captive the state, sometimes allowed no visitors for months. In 1995, her husband became ill with prostate cancer but was not allowed into Burma. She has not seen her sons since 1988. To leave would been to break the promise she made to her people. They may put Kyi away, but cannot make her go away the international stage. Winner the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991, she leads without armies, media manipulation or economic might. Naturally, has her detractors. The junta brands her a foreign stooge, and now leader a \"terrorist\" network. Ziauddin Sardar sees a modernised oriental woman who \"triggers the stereotypes associated with oriental sexuality buried deep in western consciousness\". Others have more credible reservations. Kyi, like Benazir Bhutto and Indira Gandhi before her, the beneficiary of family privilege and power. If she had taken power in 1990, her appeal may have dulled by now. Yet she remains her tower, inviolate. In this increasingly grubby world of expedient and violent politics, the miracle is not that Kyi survives but that she continues to matter so much. Not since Nelson Mandela's long incarceration has a political prisoner drawn so much and such consistent support from millions the world over.Yasmin Alibhai-Brown 2. Nelson Mandela - First president the free South AfricaImprisoned the apartheid regime for 27 years He has made such an impact the whole world simply by wishing be treated as an equal.Andrew Barrett, Bedford I have visited South Africa. have spoken with many who lived through apartheid. The fact that I encountered everywhere a philosophy of looking towards the future rather than being bitter the past is largely, I believe, because Mandela set the example.Anna Lindsay, Cambridge is living proof that one man can make a difference.Kathy Hansen, Sunderland He inspired other Southern African (Namibian and Zimbabwean) people to continue to struggle to end the evil system of apartheid; he kept his standards even under the oppression of prison life, befriending his jailer, encouraging his comrades, educating, learning, and refining his skills and wisdom. He still inspires world the fight end poverty and other struggles as that the Palestinian people the hope of ending their oppression/occupation. is above all a warm, forgiving and open human being.Patricia Bryden, Edinburgh Labelled a terrorist, he experienced harsh racial hatred and discrimination was imprisoned for more than 25 years his political views. Yet, on release, he not seek revenge; he showed his statesmanship, good and humour, and not reject the white minority that had held millions of his fellow black countrymen as almost non-citizens, almost slave labour. What humility and generosity of spirit. If we are to bring about any form of harmony between the peoples this planet, he is our role model. is a giant who humbles us all.H Glenister, Taunton 3. Bob Geldof - Pop star turned poverty campaignerFormer Boomtown Rats singer; fronted Live Aid in 1985 and Live 8 in 2005 For his fantastic ongoing efforts with Live Aid/8 to draw the world's attention to third-world hunger and poverty.

You might question his methods or even his politics - but in his own way, via peaceful means, he's done than most politicians, pundits and experts combined.Peter Arrand, Reading 4. John Pilger - Writer and broadcasterInvestigative and campaigning journalist, best known his war reporting For giving a voice to millions whose plights would otherwise have gone unreported the mainstream media; for regularly and willingly exposing himself to mockery and vilification by who lack his principles moral courage; and, to put it crudely, for having more balls than the rest the fourth estate put together.Tim Russell, Ho Chi Minh City Campaigns vigorously and tenaciously to expose the hypocrisy and evil the policies of western governments through his journalism. is timeless and relentless in championing the underdog, particularly the oppressed third world.E M Matthew, Alford, Aberdeenshire She changed everything5 Thatcher - British Conservative prime minister, 1979-90Ice-cream chemist who became Iron Lady; still dominates British politics years after leaving office When Thatcher was asked what had changed about British politics, she answered, with uncharacteristic immodesty, \"Everything\" - and was true. changed the atmosphere the pre-emptive cringe that successive ministries of both parties and industrial management had exhibited the unions ever since the Second World War. the of embarrassment that Britons felt the concepts of productivity and profit. changed our reliance on manufacturing industry just in time, inaugurating the services and information technology revolutions. the post-Suez attitude of appeasement and post-imperial guilt. changed politics so fundamentally that Labour Party had to drop socialism and change its name and objectives in order to get elected. Along with her friend and ideological soulmate Ronald Reagan, Thatcher the failing policy of détente with communism the confrontational one that eventually brought down the Berlin Wall in 1989. the ownership structure of vast industries, exchanging the nebulous concept of \"national\" ownership more efficient, purer (and ultimately fairer) of shareholder ownership. the way we financed the European Union budget. Meanwhile, she fundamentally changed the worse the career paths of Jim Callaghan, General Galtieri, Michael Foot, Arthur Scargill, Neil Kinnock the IRA activist Bobby Sands. Those things she not change the better she would have, if she hadn't been knifed by an overambitious cabal of cowards, fools, traitors and - worst all - Europhiles, who split the Tory party and left it feuding for half a generation, until the advent of Michael Howard in 2003. The 1992 election victory was largely down her legacy the non-leadership her absurd successor, John Major. By encouraging George Bush Sr not to \"wobble\" the first Gulf war, she international scene that has allowed Tony Blair to finish off the campaign against Saddam Hussein she started 1990, further strengthening the \"special relationship\" United States that both she and Blair so fervently believe in. Thatcher told it like it was, a way that so few politicians seem able to do nowadays. When she came to in 1979 Britain was a terrible state, with huge areas our nationalised industries collapsing, a government in craven retreat unions the country teetering the brink of relegation the second division of world powers. She recognised that only extreme shock tactics a searing honesty the type seldom seen in politics could shake the British people out of their torpor. She was always true her word. she said the lady wasn't for turning, she wasn't. the Falklands must be liberated come what may, they were. said that people be allowed to buy their own council houses, they were, too. she told European politicians she wanted a rebate the billions Britain overpaid the Community, she held out until she got one. There's a downside to all this refreshing candour. The kind of permanent revolution she offered not suit everyone, and eventually she was overthrown. But she went down fighting for her principles; no one any about she stood for and she believed in. might not have agreed with but you can't deny that hers was an the kind hardly ever heard from today's so-called leaders. That, I suspect, than her free-market ideology, is why New Statesman readers have finally acknowledged her heroism in this unexpected, if welcome, way.Andrew Roberts 6. Peter Tatchell - Gay-rights campaignerCo-founder of OutRage! who attempted a citizen's arrest on Robert Mugabe For than 30 years Tatchell has campaigned tirelessly against homophobia, racism and sexism and for civil liberties and social justice. Through direct political action and his writing, he has stood up to and confronted injustice and abuse, often at considerable risk to himself. Despite being attacked, physically and verbally, has never allowed be bullied into silence.Daniel Jamieson, Glasgow 7. Noam Chomsky - WriterProfessor of linguistics, critic of US foreign policy, advocate of free speech How many political activists can also claim be world-renowned in another field? You can count them on one hand: Chomsky, Harold Pinter, Mario Vargas Llosa, Vaclav Havel. Chomsky the supreme example of this: a linguist of genius who also became the most rigorous political analysts time. The main reason I admire him is that he deprives Reagan, Clinton, Bush et al of any of historical redemption. So often colonial crimes are pardoned because those involved can claim that they \"knew nothing\" about them (for example, 19th-century industrialists who about slavery and empire). But Chomsky ensures that America has no excuse. Vietnam, Nicaragua, Bosnia, Afghanistan, Iraq: the truth not hidden because he revealed it. And it means that of us, the US the west, who let our leaders get away with murder must either share their guilt, or stand alongside Chomsky and speak out.Amal Patrick, London N16 has shown enormous courage and been widely reviled for telling the truth. His books and articles are meticulously researched and offer the best summary and UK complicity in crimes against humanity.Geoffrey McDade, Montreal, Canada An international intellectual figurehead for opposition against American hegemony. The incredible accuracy work shows is dedicated all truth. And though the facts be gloomy reading, Chomsky does remain an optimist. In academic terms, few can rival him an opponent of imperialism, globalisation and state terrorism. An inspiration from whom we should all draw our own efforts make world a better place.Morgan Hamilton-Griffin, Beaminster, Dorset A global success story8. Bill Gates - Microsoft founderOne world's richest men of its greatest philanthropists through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Born in Seattle on 28 October 1955, the son of an attorney a schoolteacher, Gates had, the age of 17, sold his first computer program - a timetabling system the school - for $4,200. At Harvard he teamed up with an old schoolmate, Paul Allen, to write first computer-language program for a PC. The pair of them established Microsoft in 1975 and, a year later, Gates dropped of Harvard to run the company. In 1986 they floated it, raising $61m. Gates was first to spot the value in splitting the software and operating systems the hardware. \"That was a doozy,\" he once said. \"We allowed there be massive innovation the hardware side and software side.\" On top of this, he had the foresight to understand the importance of owning the dominant operating system the emerging IT industry. But he hasn't stopped there. is very aware the next generation is constantly pushing for advances and improvements the Microsoft offering. In an effort to develop and services the internet age, the company is investing heavily in research and development, thereby responding the threat posed by companies as Google. Gates not just a global businessman. the \"philanthropist-in-chief\" on global basis, is committed to giving away 95 per cent his wealth before he dies. The Gates Foundation, established in 2000, aims make health and learning available to all, and to ensure that advances in these areas reach who need them most. It supports work in than a hundred countries, with about 60 its grants going outside the US. In creating and continuing develop global brand that is part our daily lives, Gates has amassed a personal wealth of $50bn. Impressive in itself. But what makes him so special he recognises the potential the influence has on businesses and governments (he has recently agreed to advise the UK Treasury on globalisation) and the lives of people worldwide. He does his best to exploit this influence, not only own benefit, but also to inspire a new generation of and emerging economies, to improve of others. The Oxford English Dictionary defines a hero as someone \"admired for achievements and noble qualities\". There can be no argument that made monumental achievements the business world. But it way in which he encourages global approach to both business charity, the application his business brain to his charitable efforts, that mean he should be recognised just as much his noble qualities and as of today.Digby Jones 9. Dalai Lama - Buddhist spiritual leaderExiled Peace Prizewinner who campaigns for an independent Tibet In 1950, when Tenzin Gyatso (known his followers as Kundun or, west, the 14th Dalai Lama) was just 15, Chinese troops invaded Tibet. A panic-stricken Tibetan regency handed over power the teenage spiritual leader and proclaimed him king. Nine years later, when a spreading rebellion against Chinese rule reached Lhasa, Chinese responded with force the Lama his entourage escaped the Himalayas to exile in India. It is easy to imagine Dalai Lama's fate had he not fled: he have spent years a Chinese prison, accused of against the Communist Party; been dragged out be ridiculed and abused at mass rallies the cultural revolution; and, if he survived, he might been released in old age to live in Beijing a modest stipend, holding a symbolic post the state bureaucracy. All this happened the Panchen Lama, the leader - second Lama the Gelugpa - who not flee. Today Lama a globally recognised spiritual moral leader.

Mao Zedong may well have joked, as Stalin did the pope, \"How many divisions does Lama have?\" The answer is none at all. His appeal lies in demonstrating that there are things more powerful and enduring than military force. a message that does not to date.Isabel Hilton 10.

Chávez been presiding over an unusual revolution, that takes place in slow motion.

Nationally, too, has a formidable impact. The Party probably have won under John Smith in 1997 and yet, without the ideological changes Blair pioneered, a landslide been unlikely. Blair has guided Labour to three successive electoral victories. No previous Labour leader has come even close to that. Moreover, if the party can patch up its internal problems, has an excellent chance of winning again. has seen off four Tory leaders. Perhaps more importantly, has sunk the xenophobic programme that defined the Conservatives so long. David Cameron to move to Blair's ground have any of success. New Labour aimed make Britain more social democratic, concerned was to accept cosmopolitanism, invest in public and alleviate poverty. The Tories have now accepted that agenda, although they will find it very hard to sell to a large their core supporters. A fundamental of Blair's approach to emphasise the economy, has paid off handsomely. His governments be trusted the economy ahead the Conservatives, who used to hold this as their trump card.

The US would almost certainly have invaded whether was involved or not. At this point, everyone for or the intervention has to hope that somehow a decent society will emerge.

To the shipyard workers at Gdansk in 1980, was \"one of us\" a jobbing electrician with the human weaknesses, who was adored his cheek and cunning but who never asked trusted unconditionally. His instinct for audiences made a superb, shameless manipulator. I once heard him change policy times in one speech as he felt that opposition was gathering. Walesa delighted in being confrontational, winding up Communist ministers by suddenly challenging their probity, or staggering Soviet ambassador by demanding the immediate withdrawal of foreign troops. But his real delight was horse-trading, making rapid deals and compromises behind the scenes. The trouble that such deals then be sold an often dazed following, whether to workers on strike or - as the Round Table negotiations a whole political movement. Walesa was conceived a Nazi labour camp, where his was so badly starved and beaten he died shortly after being released. In 1967, he moved to Gdansk to the shipyards. There met and married his wise and valiant wife, Danuta, started large family and gained a reputation the yards man to fight the rights his mates. When the shipyards the Baltic coast rebelled against price rises in December 1970, be met by gunfire, the Gdansk leaders, but nearly lost his reputation by to broker a pact the police. Sacked for agitation in 1976, he made with underground groups hoping to organise free trade unions, was repeatedly arrested for to raise a monument the dead of 1970. A new strike wave began in Poland early summer of 1980. The trade union group in Gdansk planned a strike the Lenin Shipyard and, on 14 August, Walesa hopped the yard fence to join and, as if at once, to lead the strikers. His tactics to occupy workplaces instead of marching the street, to proclaim demands that were widely political as local workers' grievances, join forces with Poland's mutinous intellectuals - forced the regime to give way. \"Solidarity\" was born, the so-called self-limiting revolution (which not directly challenge Communist political leadership) began. In December 1981, General Jaruzelski's putsch suspended and arrested thousands its members, including Walesa. But Poland continued to simmer. In 1983, was awarded Prize in 1988, a fresh outburst of strikes allowed to edge regime into Table talks in early 1989 on Poland's future. The result, that year, a semi-free election that led first non-communist in Soviet-dominated eastern Europe. This was the end of Walesa's heroic period. He was now a politician a rebel, he soon quarrelled the new democratic government and helped Solidarity disintegrate political force. Elected president 1990, he behaved erratically and, at times, dictatorially. He quickly lost public respect. In retirement, has a genial, wisecracking figure who still occasionally re-enacts his past, appearing in Kiev to support Ukraine's \"orange revolution\" in 2004. Poles like argue the victory Solidarity in 1980 dealt whole Soviet imperium a mortal wound. Others, however, see the Solidarity revolution a \"stirring prologue\" to communism's collapse, than as its cause.

Bill Gates made his papa proud, again, when he himself was a recepient of an honorary doctorate from Harvard before giving a commencement address to students on Thursday. Gates dropped out of Harvard in 1975 to start a little company called Microsoft. Thirty two years later, after becoming the richest man in the world, Bill announced he would be quiting his day-to-day role at Microsoft to devote more time to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Dr.Bill Gates' sense of humor shined during his speech: \"I want to thank Harvard for this honor. I'll be changing my job next year, and it will be nice to finally have a college degree on my resume. I applaud the graduates for taking a much more direct route to your degrees. For my part, I'm just happy that the Crimson called me 'Harvard's successful dropout.' I guess that makes me valedictorian of my own special class. I did the best of everyone who failed.\" \"But I also to be recognized as the guy who got Steve Ballmer to drop of business school.

But this unremarkable scene was about to take a surprising turn. \"Brace yourself,\" Buffett warned with a grin. He then described a momentous change his thinking. Within months, he said, he would begin to give away his Berkshire Hathaway fortune, then and now worth well over $40 billion. This news was indeed stunning. Buffett, 75, has for decades said his wealth would go to philanthropy but has just as steadily indicated the handoff would be made at his death. Now he was revising the timetable. \"I know what I want to do,\" said, \"and it makes sense to get going.\" On that spring day his plan was uncertain in some of its details; today it is essentially complete. And is typical Buffett: rational, original, breaking the mold of how extremely rich people donate money. Buffett has pledged to gradually give 85% of Berkshire stock to five foundations. A dominant five-sixths of the shares will to the world's largest philanthropic organization, the $30 billion Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, whose principals are close friends of Buffett's (a connection that began in 1991, when a mutual friend introduced Buffett and Bill Gates). The Gateses credit Buffett, says Bill, with having \"inspired\" their thinking about giving money back to society. Their foundation's activities, internationally famous, are focused on world health -- fighting such diseases as malaria, HIV/AIDS, and tuberculosis -- and on improving U.S. libraries and high schools. Up to now, the two Gateses have been the only trustees of their foundation. But as plan gets underway, Buffett will be joining them. Bill Gates says he and his wife are \"thrilled\" by that and by knowing that Buffett's money will allow the foundation to \"both deepen and accelerate\" its work. \"The generosity and trust Warren has shown,\" Gates adds, \"is incredible.\" Beginning in July and continuing every year, will give a set, annually declining number of Berkshire B shares - starting with 602,500 in 2006 and then decreasing by 5% per year - the foundations. The gifts the Gates foundation made either by Buffett or through his estate as long as at least one the pair -- Bill, now 50, or Melinda, 41 -- is active in it. Berkshire's price on the date of each gift will determine its dollar value. Were B shares, for example, to be $3,071 July - that was their close on June 23 - Buffett's 2006 gift the foundation, 500,000 shares, be worth about $1.5 billion. With so much new money to handle, be given two years to resize its operations. But it will then be required by the terms Buffett's to annually spend the dollar amount his contributions as well as those is already making from its existing assets. At the moment, $1.5 billion would roughly double the foundation's yearly benefactions. But the billion has little relevance the value Buffett's future gifts, since their amount will depend the price of Berkshire's stock when they are made. If the stock rises yearly, on average, by even a modest amount - say, 6% - the gain will more than offset the annual 5% decline in the of shares given. Under those circumstances, Buffett's contributions will rise. Buffett himself thinks that will happen. Or to state that proposition more directly: He believes of Berkshire, and with it dollar size the contributions, will trend upward - perhaps over time increasing substantially. The other foundation gifts that Buffett is making will also occur annually and start in July. At Berkshire's current price, the combined 2006 total of these gifts be $315 million. The to foundations headed by Buffett's three children, Susan, Howard, and Peter, and the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation. This last foundation was for 40 years known simply as the Buffett Foundation and was recently renamed in honor Buffett's late wife, Susie, who died in 2004, at 72, after a stroke. Her will bestows about $2.5 billion foundation, to which her husband's be added. The foundation has mainly on reproductive health, family planning, and pro-choice causes, on preventing the spread of nuclear weapons. Counting the to all five foundations, will gradually but sharply reduce his holdings Berkshire (Charts) stock. He now owns close to 31% the company-worth nearly $44 billion in late June - and that proportion will ultimately be cut to around 5%. Sticking to his long-term intentions, Buffett says the residual 5%, about $6.8 billion today, will in time go for philanthropy also, perhaps his lifetime and, if not, death. Because Buffett's gifts are tied to a future, unknowable Berkshire, there is no way to put a total dollar value on them. shares earmarked given have a huge value today: $37 billion. That alone be the philanthropic gift in history. And if is right in thinking that price trend upward, the eventual amount given could far exceed that figure. So that's the plan. What follows is a conversation in which Buffett explains how he moved away from his original thinking and decided to begin giving now.

Spencer Platt/Getty Images hide caption Buffett, billionaire investor and founder of Berkshire Hathaway, has announced he is donating much of his fortune to charity. Over time, most of Buffett's $44 billion in stock holdings will be given Foundation. In the form Berkshire Hathaway shares, Buffett signed papers that give $31 billion to fund the Gates Foundation's work in fighting infectious diseases and reforming education. Besides the major Gates Foundation, Buffett is dividing $6 billion among four other charities started by his family members. Those foundations support environmental causes, abortion rights, helping low-income children and human rights. At a lively, jocular event at the New York Public Library, signed the letters that pledge $37 stock to five different foundations, and he reassured the crowd that he had checked the names of the beneficiaries. \"I wanted to make sure I didn't write one that says, 'Dear Anna Nicole Smith,'\" Buffett said. An investment guru often known as the Oracle of Omaha, Buffett's pledges of help have made him the most generous philanthropist in history. Roseanne Pereira Danielle Trusso Warren Buffett pledged to donate 85 percent fortune in Hathaway to several philanthropic foundations. The chart shows the current value the gifts, estimated around $37 billion. Jeremy VanderKnyff, NPR caption The Gates Foundation has provided billions of dollars of grants to scores of education and health initiatives. Foundation initiatives. It's a new take on Robin Hood: the rich giving rich to give the poor. The Foundation, a merger of several Gates charities, was created in 2000 with the goal of reducing inequities throughout the world. If any foundation could make a dent in the world's problems, it would be Foundation. It's the largest U.S. philanthropy, with an endowment of $29.2 billion. Spending by the foundation will now double, because of a donation from Buffett that amounts to $1.5 billion a year. Here, a list the four main areas of Gates grants: Global Health By far largest focus the organization, foundation has committed more than $5 billion to various public health initiatives, mostly the developing world. The foundation supports scientific research aimed at developing vaccines that do not require refrigeration, preventing insects from transmitting disease, and growing healthy crops in harsh climates. In addition to to fight the \"Big Three\" in infectious global disease: malaria, HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis, foundation funds research on other pernicious diseases world. This year alone, some largest awards included $75 million to develop a vaccine for pneumococcus, a bacterium that often causes pneumonia in children, and $22 a drug for African sleeping sickness caused the tsetse fly. foundation allocated $27 to reduce cervical cancer and $31 million was spent to control schistosomiasis, a disease by parasitic worms and transmitted to humans through a particular type of snail. Education than $2 to education. The goal is to raise the U.S. high school graduation rate and make it possible for all students to graduate equipped for work and college. To date, has invested about $1.2 to improve school foundation also awards scholarships for promising to attend college, who otherwise wouldn't have the financial means to do so, and for students of exceptional academic achievement for graduate study. This year, the foundation's largest education grants include $29 to charter school management, and than $21 to provide teacher and curriculum support in Chicago public schools. Global Library Program The Global Libraries program was launched in 1997 to increase access to technology for low-income communities through public libraries. It has two parts: U.S. Program and the International Library Initiatives. The Program installs computers, sets up networks and provides training and technical support to library staff. In January 2005, it gave $10.9 to 37 states the District of Columbia. On June 22, Gates foundation announced a $12 million grant the Southeastern Library Network to help rebuild libraries most affected the Gulf Coast hurricanes in 2005. The Library Initiatives Program targets developing countries with strong library systems and focuses on improving their computer technology. has partnered with Canada, Chile and Mexico. Pacific Northwest Since 1999, committed $5.75 million in the Pacific Northwest. Two initiatives focus improving early learning and creating affordable housing in Washington state and Greater Portland, Ore. Early Learning: Over the next 10 years, will invest up to $90 improve pre-kindergarten education. Supportive Housing: In 2000, foundation committed $40 the Sound Families Initiative. Its to create 1,500 housing units for families transitioning from homelessness. By fall 2005, 1,100 new units were funded.

Return to: Home | Politics Jason Cowley Published 22 May 2006 Inspirational - yet worlds apart: there was no doubt about the victor in our readers' survey to find the heroes of our time. But who could have predicted such strong support for Margaret Thatcher and the Queen? Cowley on the winners and losers When our issue of 3 April I invited readers and contributors to nominate their our time, I thought I had a good idea as to who might feature our final list of 50. In the event, your response was as surprising in its range and unpredictability as it was overwhelming. Who, for instance, predicted that Margaret Thatcher, scourge of trade unions and, more generally, of the liberal left, would be there our top five as nominated by you? Thatcher, as Alan Quinn, a reader from Aylsham in Norfolk wrote, \"brought a major shift in 20th-century politics. The cold war ended and state-controlled dictatorships crumbled. The free-market reduction of state-controlled economics released entrepreneurship and competition across the world. All this in a decade - remarkable!\" Another surprise, and in spite the New Statesman's commitment to republicanism, was your considerable for the Queen and Prince Charles. The Queen, wrote Jayne Fisentzides, from Halesowen in the West Midlands, \"has reigned through several generations, enduring personal and public difficulties, without once losing her dignity or being sullied by scandal\". And what are we to make the absence of Gordon Brown, especially when his old rival, Tony Blair, the Prime Minister, is top 20? Lists such as this may be arbitrary and entirely unscientific, and they may even be at the mercy of manipulation, but they are also indicative of a mood and a climate, and if I were Brown and I were, the argot, seeking to renew the Labour Party, I'd be disturbed that not a single reader of this magazine considered my work and purpose to be in any sense heroic. One the more intriguing nominations was made by Ian Hargreaves, a former NS editor who, despite some reservations the nature our exercise, opted for Bob Dylan as his hero. The grizzled rock-poet had other supporters, too, and is the highest-placed artist our list - if you exclude Bob Geldof, who is obviously not there for his work with the Boomtown Rats. To recap, our definition a hero: a man or woman whose actions have been the service the greater good and whose influence is national or international; someone is prepared to act in pursuit a freer, more equitable and democratic future, without recourse to violence. Though we asked you to consider only the living, Winston Churchill was among several the great dead to receive multiple nominations, as were Jesus Christ and Marie Curie. Some heroes, it seems, never die. Among those who just missed out from the final 50 were Roméo Dallaire, the stoical but unfortunate head the United Nations peacekeeping force in Rwanda the time the genocide in 1994; Subcomandante Marcos, the philosopher-rebel and one the leaders the Zapatista liberation movement in Mexico; the CND activist Bruce Kent; the comedian and birdwatcher Bill Oddie; the young man who defied the Chinese during the Tiananmen Square revolt of 1989 - the \"unknown rebel\", as readers called him; and, oddly, the American blue-collar rocker Bruce Springsteen. I was surprised that Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa did not make top ten. He is such a brave and admirable man, whose sense of compassion and forgiveness are defined by his faith. But perhaps when people think of bravery and moral courage in Africa they think first, and inevitably, of Nelson Mandela. There about our winner: Aung San Suu Kyi, who received three times as many nominations as even great Mandela in second place. She has, as Richard Eyre wrote of her a recent issue, \"endured grief, danger and loneliness with extraordinary grace and courage, all the while inspiring resistance to the [corrupt Burmese] regime\". A fitting winner, then, a true hero this or any other time. 1. Suu Kyi - Pro-democracy campaignerNobel Peace Prizewinner, under house arrest in her native Burma The confrontation between Kyi the brutish military rulers of Burma (officially known as Myanmar) has the power of myth. At 60, Kyi is still lovely and delicate, like the strings of scented jasmine always looped around her hair. The men in army fatigues and dark glasses who have oppressed her for so long may try to stamp out this flagrantly feminine opponent, but still she rises, unbowed and resolute. the voice of yearning Burmese democrats. Her National League for Democracy party has majority support but is denied power by the military. She is held arrest and NLD members are beaten and killed the junta's thugs. She could seek refuge abroad, where adulation awaits her, but she chooses to stay, even to death. Death has, paradoxically, been the making of Suu Kyi; it has stalked and claimed her loved ones and supporters. But each tragedy seems only to tighten her grip on life and her cause. The heady idealism of post-colonial liberation sustains her still. Her father, General Aung San, negotiator of Burma's independence the British, was assassinated by political rivals in 1947, when Kyi was only two. One brother drowned when he was eight. In 1960 her mother, Daw Khin Kyi, became the Burmese ambassador to India. There young was inspired by Gandhi's credo of non-violent resistance. Her own ideas were developed at Oxford and later in New York, where she worked the UN. In 1972, she married Michael Aris, a British scholar of Tibetan culture. They had two sons. I first met in 1974 at a dinner, she gently criticised the North Vietnamese forces for their cruelty to prisoners. We anti-Vietnam war hippies were left feeling oddly soiled. Even then, Suu Kyi's uncompromising principles provoked admiration but irritation, too. Much later, in March 1988, she returned to Burma to nurse her dying mother, and was hurled into the furnace of political chaos and military tyranny. That July the dictator General Ne Win resigned. Popular unrest spread and thousands were killed. Kyi formed the NLD. In September, the junta curtailed freedoms and announced an election. was and yet her party won. Since then she has been a de facto captive the state, sometimes allowed no visitors for months. In 1995, her husband became ill with prostate cancer but was not allowed into Burma. She has not seen her sons since 1988. To leave would been to break the promise she made to her people. They may put Kyi away, but cannot make her go away the international stage. Winner the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991, she leads without armies, media manipulation or economic might. Naturally, has her detractors. The junta brands her a foreign stooge, and now leader a \"terrorist\" network. Ziauddin Sardar sees a modernised oriental woman who \"triggers the stereotypes associated with oriental sexuality buried deep in western consciousness\". Others have more credible reservations. Kyi, like Benazir Bhutto and Indira Gandhi before her, the beneficiary of family privilege and power. If she had taken power in 1990, her appeal may have dulled by now. Yet she remains her tower, inviolate. In this increasingly grubby world of expedient and violent politics, the miracle is not that Kyi survives but that she continues to matter so much. Not since Nelson Mandela's long incarceration has a political prisoner drawn so much and such consistent support from millions the world over.Yasmin Alibhai-Brown 2. Nelson Mandela - First president the free South AfricaImprisoned the apartheid regime for 27 years He has made such an impact the whole world simply by wishing be treated as an equal.Andrew Barrett, Bedford I have visited South Africa. have spoken with many who lived through apartheid. The fact that I encountered everywhere a philosophy of looking towards the future rather than being bitter the past is largely, I believe, because Mandela set the example.Anna Lindsay, Cambridge is living proof that one man can make a difference.Kathy Hansen, Sunderland He inspired other Southern African (Namibian and Zimbabwean) people to continue to struggle to end the evil system of apartheid; he kept his standards even under the oppression of prison life, befriending his jailer, encouraging his comrades, educating, learning, and refining his skills and wisdom. He still inspires world the fight end poverty and other struggles as that the Palestinian people the hope of ending their oppression/occupation. is above all a warm, forgiving and open human being.Patricia Bryden, Edinburgh Labelled a terrorist, he experienced harsh racial hatred and discrimination was imprisoned for more than 25 years his political views. Yet, on release, he not seek revenge; he showed his statesmanship, good and humour, and not reject the white minority that had held millions of his fellow black countrymen as almost non-citizens, almost slave labour. What humility and generosity of spirit. If we are to bring about any form of harmony between the peoples this planet, he is our role model. is a giant who humbles us all.H Glenister, Taunton 3.

You might question his methods or even his politics - but in his own way, via peaceful means, he's done than most politicians, pundits and experts combined.Peter Arrand, Reading 4. John Pilger - Writer and broadcasterInvestigative and campaigning journalist, best known his war reporting For giving a voice to millions whose plights would otherwise have gone unreported the mainstream media; for regularly and willingly exposing himself to mockery and vilification by who lack his principles moral courage; and, to put it crudely, for having more balls than the rest the fourth estate put together.Tim Russell, Ho Chi Minh City Campaigns vigorously and tenaciously to expose the hypocrisy and evil the policies of western governments through his journalism. is timeless and relentless in championing the underdog, particularly the oppressed third world.E M Matthew, Alford, Aberdeenshire She changed everything5 Thatcher - British Conservative prime minister, 1979-90Ice-cream chemist who became Iron Lady; still dominates British politics years after leaving office When Thatcher was asked what had changed about British politics, she answered, with uncharacteristic immodesty, \"Everything\" - and was true. changed the atmosphere the pre-emptive cringe that successive ministries of both parties and industrial management had exhibited the unions ever since the Second World War. the of embarrassment that Britons felt the concepts of productivity and profit. changed our reliance on manufacturing industry just in time, inaugurating the services and information technology revolutions. the post-Suez attitude of appeasement and post-imperial guilt. changed politics so fundamentally that Labour Party had to drop socialism and change its name and objectives in order to get elected. Along with her friend and ideological soulmate Ronald Reagan, Thatcher the failing policy of détente with communism the confrontational one that eventually brought down the Berlin Wall in 1989. the ownership structure of vast industries, exchanging the nebulous concept of \"national\" ownership more efficient, purer (and ultimately fairer) of shareholder ownership. the way we financed the European Union budget. Meanwhile, she fundamentally changed the worse the career paths of Jim Callaghan, General Galtieri, Michael Foot, Arthur Scargill, Neil Kinnock the IRA activist Bobby Sands. Those things she not change the better she would have, if she hadn't been knifed by an overambitious cabal of cowards, fools, traitors and - worst all - Europhiles, who split the Tory party and left it feuding for half a generation, until the advent of Michael Howard in 2003. The 1992 election victory was largely down her legacy the non-leadership her absurd successor, John Major. By encouraging George Bush Sr not to \"wobble\" the first Gulf war, she international scene that has allowed Tony Blair to finish off the campaign against Saddam Hussein she started 1990, further strengthening the \"special relationship\" United States that both she and Blair so fervently believe in. Thatcher told it like it was, a way that so few politicians seem able to do nowadays. When she came to in 1979 Britain was a terrible state, with huge areas our nationalised industries collapsing, a government in craven retreat unions the country teetering the brink of relegation the second division of world powers. She recognised that only extreme shock tactics a searing honesty the type seldom seen in politics could shake the British people out of their torpor. She was always true her word. she said the lady wasn't for turning, she wasn't. the Falklands must be liberated come what may, they were. said that people be allowed to buy their own council houses, they were, too. she told European politicians she wanted a rebate the billions Britain overpaid the Community, she held out until she got one. There's a downside to all this refreshing candour. The kind of permanent revolution she offered not suit everyone, and eventually she was overthrown. But she went down fighting for her principles; no one any about she stood for and she believed in. might not have agreed with but you can't deny that hers was an the kind hardly ever heard from today's so-called leaders. That, I suspect, than her free-market ideology, is why New Statesman readers have finally acknowledged her heroism in this unexpected, if welcome, way.Andrew Roberts 6. Peter Tatchell - Gay-rights campaignerCo-founder of OutRage! who attempted a citizen's arrest on Robert Mugabe For than 30 years Tatchell has campaigned tirelessly against homophobia, racism and sexism and for civil liberties and social justice. Through direct political action and his writing, he has stood up to and confronted injustice and abuse, often at considerable risk to himself. Despite being attacked, physically and verbally, has never allowed be bullied into silence.Daniel Jamieson, Glasgow 7. Noam Chomsky - WriterProfessor of linguistics, critic of US foreign policy, advocate of free speech How many political activists can also claim be world-renowned in another field? You can count them on one hand: Chomsky, Harold Pinter, Mario Vargas Llosa, Vaclav Havel. Chomsky the supreme example of this: a linguist of genius who also became the most rigorous political analysts time. The main reason I admire him is that he deprives Reagan, Clinton, Bush et al of any of historical redemption. So often colonial crimes are pardoned because those involved can claim that they \"knew nothing\" about them (for example, 19th-century industrialists who about slavery and empire). But Chomsky ensures that America has no excuse. Vietnam, Nicaragua, Bosnia, Afghanistan, Iraq: the truth not hidden because he revealed it. And it means that of us, the US the west, who let our leaders get away with murder must either share their guilt, or stand alongside Chomsky and speak out.Amal Patrick, London N16 has shown enormous courage and been widely reviled for telling the truth. His books and articles are meticulously researched and offer the best summary and UK complicity in crimes against humanity.Geoffrey McDade, Montreal, Canada An international intellectual figurehead for opposition against American hegemony. The incredible accuracy work shows is dedicated all truth. And though the facts be gloomy reading, Chomsky does remain an optimist. In academic terms, few can rival him an opponent of imperialism, globalisation and state terrorism. An inspiration from whom we should all draw our own efforts make world a better place.Morgan Hamilton-Griffin, Beaminster, Dorset A global success story8. Bill Gates - Microsoft founderOne world's richest men of its greatest philanthropists through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Born in Seattle on 28 October 1955, the son of an attorney a schoolteacher, Gates had, the age of 17, sold his first computer program - a timetabling system the school - for $4,200. At Harvard he teamed up with an old schoolmate, Paul Allen, to write first computer-language program for a PC. The pair of them established Microsoft in 1975 and, a year later, Gates dropped of Harvard to run the company. In 1986 they floated it, raising $61m. Gates was first to spot the value in splitting the software and operating systems the hardware. \"That was a doozy,\" he once said. \"We allowed there be massive innovation the hardware side and software side.\" On top of this, he had the foresight to understand the importance of owning the dominant operating system the emerging IT industry. But he hasn't stopped there. is very aware the next generation is constantly pushing for advances and improvements the Microsoft offering. In an effort to develop and services the internet age, the company is investing heavily in research and development, thereby responding the threat posed by companies as Google. Gates not just a global businessman. the \"philanthropist-in-chief\" on global basis, is committed to giving away 95 per cent his wealth before he dies. The Gates Foundation, established in 2000, aims make health and learning available to all, and to ensure that advances in these areas reach who need them most. It supports work in than a hundred countries, with about 60 its grants going outside the US. In creating and continuing develop global brand that is part our daily lives, Gates has amassed a personal wealth of $50bn. Impressive in itself. But what makes him so special he recognises the potential the influence has on businesses and governments (he has recently agreed to advise the UK Treasury on globalisation) and the lives of people worldwide. He does his best to exploit this influence, not only own benefit, but also to inspire a new generation of and emerging economies, to improve of others. The Oxford English Dictionary defines a hero as someone \"admired for achievements and noble qualities\". There can be no argument that made monumental achievements the business world. But it way in which he encourages global approach to both business charity, the application his business brain to his charitable efforts, that mean he should be recognised just as much his noble qualities and as of today.Digby Jones 9. Dalai Lama - Buddhist spiritual leaderExiled Peace Prizewinner who campaigns for an independent Tibet In 1950, when Tenzin Gyatso (known his followers as Kundun or, west, the 14th Dalai Lama) was just 15, Chinese troops invaded Tibet. A panic-stricken Tibetan regency handed over power the teenage spiritual leader and proclaimed him king. Nine years later, when a spreading rebellion against Chinese rule reached Lhasa, Chinese responded with force the Lama his entourage escaped the Himalayas to exile in India. It is easy to imagine Dalai Lama's fate had he not fled: he have spent years a Chinese prison, accused of against the Communist Party; been dragged out be ridiculed and abused at mass rallies the cultural revolution; and, if he survived, he might been released in old age to live in Beijing a modest stipend, holding a symbolic post the state bureaucracy. All this happened the Panchen Lama, the leader - second Lama the Gelugpa - who not flee. Today Lama a globally recognised spiritual moral leader.

China's Communist Party calls him a fake religious leader, the an evil clique that plots to \"split\" the motherland. followers in Tibet, these epithets to confirm his to moral leadership. Mao Zedong may well have joked, as Stalin did the pope, \"How many divisions does Lama have?\" The answer is none at all. His appeal lies in demonstrating that there are things more powerful and enduring than military force. a message that does not to date.Isabel Hilton 10.

Chávez been presiding over an unusual revolution, that takes place in slow motion. This not an attack the Bastille or a seizure the Winter Palace, but a long-drawn-out process of peaceful conflict change has brought fresh players on the stage.

To the shipyard workers at Gdansk in 1980, was \"one of us\" a jobbing electrician with the human weaknesses, who was adored his cheek and cunning but who never asked trusted unconditionally. His instinct for audiences made a superb, shameless manipulator. I once heard him change policy times in one speech as he felt that opposition was gathering. Walesa delighted in being confrontational, winding up Communist ministers by suddenly challenging their probity, or staggering Soviet ambassador by demanding the immediate withdrawal of foreign troops. But his real delight was horse-trading, making rapid deals and compromises behind the scenes. The trouble that such deals then be sold an often dazed following, whether to workers on strike or - as the Round Table negotiations a whole political movement. Walesa was conceived a Nazi labour camp, where his was so badly starved and beaten he died shortly after being released. In 1967, he moved to Gdansk to the shipyards. There met and married his wise and valiant wife, Danuta, started large family and gained a reputation the yards man to fight the rights his mates. When the shipyards the Baltic coast rebelled against price rises in December 1970, be met by gunfire, the Gdansk leaders, but nearly lost his reputation by to broker a pact the police. Sacked for agitation in 1976, he made with underground groups hoping to organise free trade unions, was repeatedly arrested for to raise a monument the dead of 1970. A new strike wave began in Poland early summer of 1980. The trade union group in Gdansk planned a strike the Lenin Shipyard and, on 14 August, Walesa hopped the yard fence to join and, as if at once, to lead the strikers. His tactics to occupy workplaces instead of marching the street, to proclaim demands that were widely political as local workers' grievances, join forces with Poland's mutinous intellectuals - forced the regime to give way. \"Solidarity\" was born, the so-called self-limiting revolution (which not directly challenge Communist political leadership) began. In December 1981, General Jaruzelski's putsch suspended and arrested thousands its members, including Walesa. But Poland continued to simmer. In 1983, was awarded Prize in 1988, a fresh outburst of strikes allowed to edge regime into Table talks in early 1989 on Poland's future. The result, that year, a semi-free election that led first non-communist in Soviet-dominated eastern Europe. This was the end of Walesa's heroic period. He was now a politician a rebel, he soon quarrelled the new democratic government and helped Solidarity disintegrate political force. Elected president 1990, he behaved erratically and, at times, dictatorially. He quickly lost public respect. In retirement, has a genial, wisecracking figure who still occasionally re-enacts his past, appearing in Kiev to support Ukraine's \"orange revolution\" in 2004. Poles like argue the victory Solidarity in 1980 dealt whole Soviet imperium a mortal wound. Others, however, see the Solidarity revolution a \"stirring prologue\" to communism's collapse, than as its cause.

Bill Gates made his papa proud, again, when he himself was a recepient of an honorary doctorate from Harvard before giving a commencement address to students on Thursday. Gates dropped out of Harvard in 1975 to start a little company called Microsoft. Thirty two years later, after becoming the richest man in the world, Bill announced he would be quiting his day-to-day role at Microsoft to devote more time to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Dr.Bill Gates' sense of humor shined during his speech: \"I want to thank Harvard for this honor. I'll be changing my job next year, and it will be nice to finally have a college degree on my resume. I applaud the graduates for taking a much more direct route to your degrees. For my part, I'm just happy that the Crimson called me 'Harvard's successful dropout.' I guess that makes me valedictorian of my own special class. I did the best of everyone who failed.\" \"But I also to be recognized as the guy who got Steve Ballmer to drop of business school. [Ballmer, now Microsoft's CEO, was also there, sitting the crowd behind Gates.] I'm a bad influence. That's why I was invited to speak at your graduation.

Return to: Home | Politics Jason Cowley Published 22 May 2006 Inspirational - yet worlds apart: there was no doubt about the victor in our readers' survey to find the heroes of our time. But who could have predicted such strong support for Margaret Thatcher and the Queen? Cowley on the winners and losers When our issue of 3 April I invited readers and contributors to nominate their our time, I thought I had a good idea as to who might feature our final list of 50. In the event, your response was as surprising in its range and unpredictability as it was overwhelming. Who, for instance, predicted that Margaret Thatcher, scourge of trade unions and, more generally, of the liberal left, would be there our top five as nominated by you? Thatcher, as Alan Quinn, a reader from Aylsham in Norfolk wrote, \"brought a major shift in 20th-century politics. The cold war ended and state-controlled dictatorships crumbled. The free-market reduction of state-controlled economics released entrepreneurship and competition across the world. All this in a decade - remarkable!\" Another surprise, and in spite the New Statesman's commitment to republicanism, was your considerable for the Queen and Prince Charles. The Queen, wrote Jayne Fisentzides, from Halesowen in the West Midlands, \"has reigned through several generations, enduring personal and public difficulties, without once losing her dignity or being sullied by scandal\". And what are we to make the absence of Gordon Brown, especially when his old rival, Tony Blair, the Prime Minister, is top 20? Lists such as this may be arbitrary and entirely unscientific, and they may even be at the mercy of manipulation, but they are also indicative of a mood and a climate, and if I were Brown and I were, the argot, seeking to renew the Labour Party, I'd be disturbed that not a single reader of this magazine considered my work and purpose to be in any sense heroic. One the more intriguing nominations was made by Ian Hargreaves, a former NS editor who, despite some reservations the nature our exercise, opted for Bob Dylan as his hero. The grizzled rock-poet had other supporters, too, and is the highest-placed artist our list - if you exclude Bob Geldof, who is obviously not there for his work with the Boomtown Rats. To recap, our definition a hero: a man or woman whose actions have been the service the greater good and whose influence is national or international; someone is prepared to act in pursuit a freer, more equitable and democratic future, without recourse to violence. Though we asked you to consider only the living, Winston Churchill was among several the great dead to receive multiple nominations, as were Jesus Christ and Marie Curie. Some heroes, it seems, never die. Among those who just missed out from the final 50 were Roméo Dallaire, the stoical but unfortunate head the United Nations peacekeeping force in Rwanda the time the genocide in 1994; Subcomandante Marcos, the philosopher-rebel and one the leaders the Zapatista liberation movement in Mexico; the CND activist Bruce Kent; the comedian and birdwatcher Bill Oddie; the young man who defied the Chinese during the Tiananmen Square revolt of 1989 - the \"unknown rebel\", as readers called him; and, oddly, the American blue-collar rocker Bruce Springsteen. I was surprised that Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa did not make top ten. He is such a brave and admirable man, whose sense of compassion and forgiveness are defined by his faith. But perhaps when people think of bravery and moral courage in Africa they think first, and inevitably, of Nelson Mandela. There about our winner: Aung San Suu Kyi, who received three times as many nominations as even great Mandela in second place. She has, as Richard Eyre wrote of her a recent issue, \"endured grief, danger and loneliness with extraordinary grace and courage, all the while inspiring resistance to the [corrupt Burmese] regime\". A fitting winner, then, a true hero this or any other time. 1. Suu Kyi - Pro-democracy campaignerNobel Peace Prizewinner, under house arrest in her native Burma The confrontation between Kyi the brutish military rulers of Burma (officially known as Myanmar) has the power of myth. At 60, Kyi is still lovely and delicate, like the strings of scented jasmine always looped around her hair. The men in army fatigues and dark glasses who have oppressed her for so long may try to stamp out this flagrantly feminine opponent, but still she rises, unbowed and resolute. the voice of yearning Burmese democrats. Her National League for Democracy party has majority support but is denied power by the military. She is held arrest and NLD members are beaten and killed the junta's thugs. She could seek refuge abroad, where adulation awaits her, but she chooses to stay, even to death. Death has, paradoxically, been the making of Suu Kyi; it has stalked and claimed her loved ones and supporters. But each tragedy seems only to tighten her grip on life and her cause. The heady idealism of post-colonial liberation sustains her still. Her father, General Aung San, negotiator of Burma's independence the British, was assassinated by political rivals in 1947, when Kyi was only two. One brother drowned when he was eight. In 1960 her mother, Daw Khin Kyi, became the Burmese ambassador to India. There young was inspired by Gandhi's credo of non-violent resistance. Her own ideas were developed at Oxford and later in New York, where she worked the UN. In 1972, she married Michael Aris, a British scholar of Tibetan culture. They had two sons. I first met in 1974 at a dinner, she gently criticised the North Vietnamese forces for their cruelty to prisoners. We anti-Vietnam war hippies were left feeling oddly soiled. Even then, Suu Kyi's uncompromising principles provoked admiration but irritation, too. Much later, in March 1988, she returned to Burma to nurse her dying mother, and was hurled into the furnace of political chaos and military tyranny. That July the dictator General Ne Win resigned. Popular unrest spread and thousands were killed. Kyi formed the NLD. In September, the junta curtailed freedoms and announced an election. was and yet her party won. Since then she has been a de facto captive the state, sometimes allowed no visitors for months. In 1995, her husband became ill with prostate cancer but was not allowed into Burma. She has not seen her sons since 1988. To leave would been to break the promise she made to her people. They may put Kyi away, but cannot make her go away the international stage. Winner the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991, she leads without armies, media manipulation or economic might. Naturally, has her detractors. The junta brands her a foreign stooge, and now leader a \"terrorist\" network. Ziauddin Sardar sees a modernised oriental woman who \"triggers the stereotypes associated with oriental sexuality buried deep in western consciousness\". Others have more credible reservations. Kyi, like Benazir Bhutto and Indira Gandhi before her, the beneficiary of family privilege and power. If she had taken power in 1990, her appeal may have dulled by now. Yet she remains her tower, inviolate. In this increasingly grubby world of expedient and violent politics, the miracle is not that Kyi survives but that she continues to matter so much. Not since Nelson Mandela's long incarceration has a political prisoner drawn so much and such consistent support from millions the world over.Yasmin Alibhai-Brown 2. Nelson Mandela - First president the free South AfricaImprisoned the apartheid regime for 27 years He has made such an impact the whole world simply by wishing be treated as an equal.Andrew Barrett, Bedford I have visited South Africa. have spoken with many who lived through apartheid. The fact that I encountered everywhere a philosophy of looking towards the future rather than being bitter the past is largely, I believe, because Mandela set the example.Anna Lindsay, Cambridge is living proof that one man can make a difference.Kathy Hansen, Sunderland He inspired other Southern African (Namibian and Zimbabwean) people to continue to struggle to end the evil system of apartheid; he kept his standards even under the oppression of prison life, befriending his jailer, encouraging his comrades, educating, learning, and refining his skills and wisdom. He still inspires world the fight end poverty and other struggles as that the Palestinian people the hope of ending their oppression/occupation. is above all a warm, forgiving and open human being.Patricia Bryden, Edinburgh Labelled a terrorist, he experienced harsh racial hatred and discrimination was imprisoned for more than 25 years his political views. Yet, on release, he not seek revenge; he showed his statesmanship, good and humour, and not reject the white minority that had held millions of his fellow black countrymen as almost non-citizens, almost slave labour. What humility and generosity of spirit. If we are to bring about any form of harmony between the peoples this planet, he is our role model. is a giant who humbles us all.H Glenister, Taunton 3.

You might question his methods or even his politics - but in his own way, via peaceful means, he's done than most politicians, pundits and experts combined.Peter Arrand, Reading 4. John Pilger - Writer and broadcasterInvestigative and campaigning journalist, best known his war reporting For giving a voice to millions whose plights would otherwise have gone unreported the mainstream media; for regularly and willingly exposing himself to mockery and vilification by who lack his principles moral courage; and, to put it crudely, for having more balls than the rest the fourth estate put together.Tim Russell, Ho Chi Minh City Campaigns vigorously and tenaciously to expose the hypocrisy and evil the policies of western governments through his journalism. is timeless and relentless in championing the underdog, particularly the oppressed third world.E M Matthew, Alford, Aberdeenshire She changed everything5 Thatcher - British Conservative prime minister, 1979-90Ice-cream chemist who became Iron Lady; still dominates British politics years after leaving office When Thatcher was asked what had changed about British politics, she answered, with uncharacteristic immodesty, \"Everything\" - and was true. changed the atmosphere the pre-emptive cringe that successive ministries of both parties and industrial management had exhibited the unions ever since the Second World War. the of embarrassment that Britons felt the concepts of productivity and profit. changed our reliance on manufacturing industry just in time, inaugurating the services and information technology revolutions. the post-Suez attitude of appeasement and post-imperial guilt. changed politics so fundamentally that Labour Party had to drop socialism and change its name and objectives in order to get elected. Along with her friend and ideological soulmate Ronald Reagan, Thatcher the failing policy of détente with communism the confrontational one that eventually brought down the Berlin Wall in 1989. the ownership structure of vast industries, exchanging the nebulous concept of \"national\" ownership more efficient, purer (and ultimately fairer) of shareholder ownership. the way we financed the European Union budget. Meanwhile, she fundamentally changed the worse the career paths of Jim Callaghan, General Galtieri, Michael Foot, Arthur Scargill, Neil Kinnock the IRA activist Bobby Sands. Those things she not change the better she would have, if she hadn't been knifed by an overambitious cabal of cowards, fools, traitors and - worst all - Europhiles, who split the Tory party and left it feuding for half a generation, until the advent of Michael Howard in 2003. The 1992 election victory was largely down her legacy the non-leadership her absurd successor, John Major. By encouraging George Bush Sr not to \"wobble\" the first Gulf war, she international scene that has allowed Tony Blair to finish off the campaign against Saddam Hussein she started 1990, further strengthening the \"special relationship\" United States that both she and Blair so fervently believe in. Thatcher told it like it was, a way that so few politicians seem able to do nowadays. When she came to in 1979 Britain was a terrible state, with huge areas our nationalised industries collapsing, a government in craven retreat unions the country teetering the brink of relegation the second division of world powers. She recognised that only extreme shock tactics a searing honesty the type seldom seen in politics could shake the British people out of their torpor. She was always true her word. she said the lady wasn't for turning, she wasn't. the Falklands must be liberated come what may, they were. said that people be allowed to buy their own council houses, they were, too. she told European politicians she wanted a rebate the billions Britain overpaid the Community, she held out until she got one. There's a downside to all this refreshing candour. The kind of permanent revolution she offered not suit everyone, and eventually she was overthrown. But she went down fighting for her principles; no one any about she stood for and she believed in. might not have agreed with but you can't deny that hers was an the kind hardly ever heard from today's so-called leaders. That, I suspect, than her free-market ideology, is why New Statesman readers have finally acknowledged her heroism in this unexpected, if welcome, way.Andrew Roberts 6. Peter Tatchell - Gay-rights campaignerCo-founder of OutRage! who attempted a citizen's arrest on Robert Mugabe For than 30 years Tatchell has campaigned tirelessly against homophobia, racism and sexism and for civil liberties and social justice. Through direct political action and his writing, he has stood up to and confronted injustice and abuse, often at considerable risk to himself. Despite being attacked, physically and verbally, has never allowed be bullied into silence.Daniel Jamieson, Glasgow 7. Noam Chomsky - WriterProfessor of linguistics, critic of US foreign policy, advocate of free speech How many political activists can also claim be world-renowned in another field? You can count them on one hand: Chomsky, Harold Pinter, Mario Vargas Llosa, Vaclav Havel. Chomsky the supreme example of this: a linguist of genius who also became the most rigorous political analysts time. The main reason I admire him is that he deprives Reagan, Clinton, Bush et al of any of historical redemption. So often colonial crimes are pardoned because those involved can claim that they \"knew nothing\" about them (for example, 19th-century industrialists who about slavery and empire). But Chomsky ensures that America has no excuse. Vietnam, Nicaragua, Bosnia, Afghanistan, Iraq: the truth not hidden because he revealed it. And it means that of us, the US the west, who let our leaders get away with murder must either share their guilt, or stand alongside Chomsky and speak out.Amal Patrick, London N16 has shown enormous courage and been widely reviled for telling the truth. His books and articles are meticulously researched and offer the best summary and UK complicity in crimes against humanity.Geoffrey McDade, Montreal, Canada An international intellectual figurehead for opposition against American hegemony. The incredible accuracy work shows is dedicated all truth. And though the facts be gloomy reading, Chomsky does remain an optimist. In academic terms, few can rival him an opponent of imperialism, globalisation and state terrorism. An inspiration from whom we should all draw our own efforts make world a better place.Morgan Hamilton-Griffin, Beaminster, Dorset A global success story8. Bill Gates - Microsoft founderOne world's richest men of its greatest philanthropists through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Born in Seattle on 28 October 1955, the son of an attorney a schoolteacher, Gates had, the age of 17, sold his first computer program - a timetabling system the school - for $4,200. At Harvard he teamed up with an old schoolmate, Paul Allen, to write first computer-language program for a PC. The pair of them established Microsoft in 1975 and, a year later, Gates dropped of Harvard to run the company. In 1986 they floated it, raising $61m. Gates was first to spot the value in splitting the software and operating systems the hardware. \"That was a doozy,\" he once said. \"We allowed there be massive innovation the hardware side and software side.\" On top of this, he had the foresight to understand the importance of owning the dominant operating system the emerging IT industry. But he hasn't stopped there. is very aware the next generation is constantly pushing for advances and improvements the Microsoft offering. In an effort to develop and services the internet age, the company is investing heavily in research and development, thereby responding the threat posed by companies as Google. Gates not just a global businessman. the \"philanthropist-in-chief\" on global basis, is committed to giving away 95 per cent his wealth before he dies. The Gates Foundation, established in 2000, aims make health and learning available to all, and to ensure that advances in these areas reach who need them most. It supports work in than a hundred countries, with about 60 its grants going outside the US. In creating and continuing develop global brand that is part our daily lives, Gates has amassed a personal wealth of $50bn. Impressive in itself. But what makes him so special he recognises the potential the influence has on businesses and governments (he has recently agreed to advise the UK Treasury on globalisation) and the lives of people worldwide. He does his best to exploit this influence, not only own benefit, but also to inspire a new generation of and emerging economies, to improve of others. The Oxford English Dictionary defines a hero as someone \"admired for achievements and noble qualities\". There can be no argument that made monumental achievements the business world. But it way in which he encourages global approach to both business charity, the application his business brain to his charitable efforts, that mean he should be recognised just as much his noble qualities and as of today.Digby Jones 9. Dalai Lama - Buddhist spiritual leaderExiled Peace Prizewinner who campaigns for an independent Tibet In 1950, when Tenzin Gyatso (known his followers as Kundun or, west, the 14th Dalai Lama) was just 15, Chinese troops invaded Tibet. A panic-stricken Tibetan regency handed over power the teenage spiritual leader and proclaimed him king. Nine years later, when a spreading rebellion against Chinese rule reached Lhasa, Chinese responded with force the Lama his entourage escaped the Himalayas to exile in India. It is easy to imagine Dalai Lama's fate had he not fled: he have spent years a Chinese prison, accused of against the Communist Party; been dragged out be ridiculed and abused at mass rallies the cultural revolution; and, if he survived, he might been released in old age to live in Beijing a modest stipend, holding a symbolic post the state bureaucracy.

To the shipyard workers at Gdansk in 1980, was \"one of us\" a jobbing electrician with the human weaknesses, who was adored his cheek and cunning but who never asked trusted unconditionally. His instinct for audiences made a superb, shameless manipulator. I once heard him change policy times in one speech as he felt that opposition was gathering. Walesa delighted in being confrontational, winding up Communist ministers by suddenly challenging their probity, or staggering Soviet ambassador by demanding the immediate withdrawal of foreign troops. But his real delight was horse-trading, making rapid deals and compromises behind the scenes. The trouble that such deals then be sold an often dazed following, whether to workers on strike or - as the Round Table negotiations a whole political movement. Walesa was conceived a Nazi labour camp, where his was so badly starved and beaten he died shortly after being released. In 1967, he moved to Gdansk to the shipyards. There met and married his wise and valiant wife, Danuta, started large family and gained a reputation the yards man to fight the rights his mates. When the shipyards the Baltic coast rebelled against price rises in December 1970, be met by gunfire, the Gdansk leaders, but nearly lost his reputation by to broker a pact the police. Sacked for agitation in 1976, he made with underground groups hoping to organise free trade unions, was repeatedly arrested for to raise a monument the dead of 1970. A new strike wave began in Poland early summer of 1980. The trade union group in Gdansk planned a strike the Lenin Shipyard and, on 14 August, Walesa hopped the yard fence to join and, as if at once, to lead the strikers. His tactics to occupy workplaces instead of marching the street, to proclaim demands that were widely political as local workers' grievances, join forces with Poland's mutinous intellectuals - forced the regime to give way. \"Solidarity\" was born, the so-called self-limiting revolution (which not directly challenge Communist political leadership) began. In December 1981, General Jaruzelski's putsch suspended and arrested thousands its members, including Walesa. But Poland continued to simmer. In 1983, was awarded Prize in 1988, a fresh outburst of strikes allowed to edge regime into Table talks in early 1989 on Poland's future. The result, that year, a semi-free election that led first non-communist in Soviet-dominated eastern Europe. This was the end of Walesa's heroic period. He was now a politician a rebel, he soon quarrelled the new democratic government and helped Solidarity disintegrate political force. Elected president 1990, he behaved erratically and, at times, dictatorially. He quickly lost public respect. In retirement, has a genial, wisecracking figure who still occasionally re-enacts his past, appearing in Kiev to support Ukraine's \"orange revolution\" in 2004. Poles like argue the victory Solidarity in 1980 dealt whole Soviet imperium a mortal wound. Others, however, see the Solidarity revolution a \"stirring prologue\" to communism's collapse, than as its cause.

Bill Gates made his papa proud, again, when he himself was a recepient of an honorary doctorate from Harvard before giving a commencement address to students on Thursday. Gates dropped out of Harvard in 1975 to start a little company called Microsoft. Thirty two years later, after becoming the richest man in the world, Bill announced he would be quiting his day-to-day role at Microsoft to devote more time to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Dr.Bill Gates' sense of humor shined during his speech: \"I want to thank Harvard for this honor. I'll be changing my job next year, and it will be nice to finally have a college degree on my resume. I applaud the graduates for taking a much more direct route to your degrees. For my part, I'm just happy that the Crimson called me 'Harvard's successful dropout.' I guess that makes me valedictorian of my own special class. I did the best of everyone who failed.\" \"But I also to be recognized as the guy who got Steve Ballmer to drop of business school. [Ballmer, now Microsoft's CEO, was also there, sitting the crowd behind Gates.] I'm a bad influence. That's why I was invited to speak at your graduation. If I had spoken your orientation, fewer of you might be here today.\" Congratulations Dr. Gates! You've done it again, this time one-uping Steve Jobs and Michael Dell with your shiny from Harvard.

Adding another chapter to his already bulging book of major titles, the great Swiss brilliantly salvaged a spotty year and won his fifth successive US Open crown and 13th Grand Slam title overall, with a decisive 6-2, 7-5, 6-2 victory over British upstart Andy Murray on Monday. The mono-plagued Federer, who looked physically tapped in falling to Novak Djokovic in Australia, looked like he was waving the white flag in a quick loss to Rafael Nadal at the French Open, looked thoroughly depressed after Nadal stopped his five-title steak at Wimbledon, and who played confused after James Blake stopped him the Olympics, was cast into the long shadow of Arthur Ashe Stadium. Out came the Swiss superhero, the one who had stomped every contender thrown at at Ashe Stadium with blinding attacks. Like Lleyton Hewitt, Andre Agassi, Andy Roddick and Djokovic before him, Murray was no match for Federer’s all-court wizardry or his steely resolve. “I always knew that if I were to get one Slam under my belt, especially the last one, things weren't looking that bad like everybody was talking about,” Federer said. \"I was always positive, and for this reason, I think this is really a great effort from my side, to people saying I was under pressure. I didn't feel under pressure to prove myself in trying to win here, but this definitely feels very sweet, and think it's key this season.” Federer came the tournament looking nowhere near the player who raced through the field last year, but by the time he reached the semifinals, was ready to fly again. He belted Djokovic with twisting serves, searing forehands and heady net rushes and did much the same to the creative Murray, who never got a chance to organize his Scottish band of rebellious strokes because Federer overwhelmed him from the start. Even though he the match a 1-2 record against the feisty Scott, Federer was never tentative, going for his first serves, hammering at Murray’s forehand, torching his foe’s second serves and continually coming to net, even he didn’t have great day the net. He played like a legend on court, where was now won 34 consecutive matches, smart responding to Murray’s change in tactics and never allowing the 21-year-old to dig in, he did in upsetting Nadal in the semis. He broke Murray three times a six-game run to go ahead 6-2, 2-0 and then, the only period of match when the Scot began to zone, stood extremely strong. Serving at 2-2, he fought off three break points a series of ferocious forehands, and when Murray came off his chair serving at 5-6, Swiss locked in. Every short ball that came onto his plate was put away, and there no over-reliance on defense win the set. Federer tightened his headband and then strangled Murray, winning the set when he gamely chased down a Murray drop shot and caressed a forehand pass down the line. The match all but ended there, as no way that was going to come back from two sets down against a guy who is one the greatest frontrunners of all time. Federer raced to a 5-0 lead the third set, had a brief hiccup then closed it out a muscular, backhand cross-court winner and slid his back in pure elation. When the two embraced the net, Murray a message for him. “He told me that it was great tournament for me, I said that I agreed with everyone that he's a terrible year,” Murray said a laugh. \"Making the semis of Australia, the final the French, final Wimbledon, playing the best matches all time, winning a gold medal [in doubles] and, obviously, the US Open. I told him that he a phenomenal year, regardless of what anyone said. I a lot of respect for him.” Federer became the first man since Bill Tilden in 1924 to triumph five a row Open and man in history win Wimbledon Open on five straight occasions. With 13 Grand Slams, he’s one within Pete Sampras’ all-time record of 14, and it’s hard to believe that at age 27, he won’t pass him. “It's nice to compare five Wimbledons to five US Opens, no doubt. Not many guys -- nobody can do that,” said Federer a laugh, who spent a good 20 minutes on court after the trophy presentation celebrating with his friends, family and, yes, fans. “I'm quite proud, obviously, of my achievement. It takes lot out of a player, always go from one tournament the next and to do your best, but I mean, it's been a tough summer. think French Open loss was brutal, I got over that one pretty easily, played great on the grass and a really tough loss Wimbledon, which -- was proud to be part of such great match. But, same time, it just sort of made me sad, not having won that great epic match. Maybe always dreaming about it and not winning it. always positive. I lost quite a few matches I should have never lost, and they hurt. \"Now, getting the fifth US Open, it really means lot to me. I really thank the fans, as well, the crowds. They were great. And losing my No. 1 ranking, that's also what meant to me this season. So to bounce back straightaway after losing the ranking, is best scenario ever.” Then there will be little debate as to who greatest player ever is. During the presentation ceremony, Murray tabbed him as greatest ever. “In the big tournaments, he never has early losses,\" Murray said. \"He's been so dominant, in terms of ranking, for last five years, even when think Nadal might get very close to same amount of Slams as Federer and Sampras. Even when someone as good as him, is right behind him, he's still a long way ahead in points, and it's only been until this year that Nadal has caught up to him. \"So think that of five years of dominance, the runs here and Wimbledon, winning five a row, and even French, he's definitely a better clay-court player than Sampras. He's coming up against definitely best player all time in Nadal. There's a very strong argument for him being best player.\" again. occasions. is. Thursday, February 19, 2009 2:44 PM ET"]}]}

When we would joke with local people that we wanted to have lunch with the King and Queen, you know, talk over a few things, Thais would get real serious and change the subject quickly. In fact, we later discovered that any derogatory comments about royal family was illegal and not condoned. Since Bangkok is so large and difficult to get around, our appreciation of this momentous occasion was limited to hearing the loudest fireworks display since Krakatoa, and the extensive street decorations and parades. On the actual day of December 5 everything closed, and unlike most American holidays there a strong sense that this day was indeed something special, out the ordinary, different than we'd ever seen.

The manuscript features many changes, deletions, and additions, and numerous doodles, sketches, mathematical calculations, rhyming schemes, and drawings. Watt is a whale of a manuscript—a white whale. Among the thousands of modern manuscripts in the Ransom Center, it glows like a luminous secular relic. It is, at moments, magnificently ornate, a worthy scion of The Book of Kells, with the colors reduced to more somber hues. The doodles, cartoons, caricatures, portraits en cartouche include reminiscences of African and Oceanic art, the gargoyles of Notre-Dame, heraldry, and more. Beckett’s handwriting is at its most deceptively cursive. Eppur si legge! And it “reads” in other ways too. Jorge Luis Borges, examining Watt tactilely, sensed something of its extraordinary qualities, which, obviously, must transcend the visual. He asked his companion to describe it to him. This she did in detail, Borges nodding, “Yes, yes,” with a happy smile throughout her description. 8 figure 8 The 297-page typescript (some are carbon copy sheets) of Watt contains substantial differences from the published text and is marked at the beginning, “Original typescript of / Watt Incomplete / Samuel Beckett.” Beckett introduced numerous autograph revisions and and some doodles and mathematical calculations in ink, colored crayons, and pencil.

Arjuna Ranatunga is looting souvenirs, no giant grin, just a smirk, then regular business. Muttiah Muralitharan is beaming as he rushes onto the field. Asanka Gurusinha is closing in like a one-man buffalo stampede. Ranatunga shoves his bat under his armpit and goes first to Mark Taylor, extending a gloved hand and polite thanks, accepting Taylor's congratulations. The invaders arrive in waves - first overjoyed team-mates, then high-strung security personnel, photographers, organisers and fans. is oddly stoic among the whirl of bodies, an atom's nucleus around which electrons dance chaotically. He has a slow embrace for Aravinda de Silva, wraps his arms paternally around Murali, but each new well-wisher who approaches, or shakes his hand, or hugs him, is more animated than Ranatunga. They are tousling his hair, slapping him on the back, holding his head and planting kisses on his nose. On air, Tony Greig is exultant. \"This is a little fairy tale,\" he crows. \"The thing I like about these guys is, not only do they win, they win in great style. They play the sort of cricket people want to watch. They've come such a long way in a short period of time.\" It was while amassing 398 for 5 against Kenya in Kandy that an unfettered Sri Lanka discovered the full extent of their batting ability ability Minutes later, Ranatunga receives the trophy from Benazir Bhutto and holds it aloft gently for two seconds, maybe three. Six months earlier, bookmakers had thought this a one in 66 chance. Ranatunga has just masterminded one of the greatest underdog stories in the history of his sport, yet in contrast to the unfettered joy his men, he is so restrained is almost smug. Before midnight, Ranatunga, trophy and the team are all on a flight back to Colombo. \"It's as if someone had foretold Arjuna that Lanka were going to win,\" remembers Sidath Wettimuny, the former Sri Lankan batsman who was effectively the team's selector on tour for the tournament. \"He must have been told that by an astrologer, or soothsayer or something, you know. He knew it in his bones.\" That Ranatunga was dead certain a team of part-time bank clerks, insurance men, and salespeople would win a Cup suggests both vision and self-delusion, because while it was reasonable to expect Lanka to turn heads, there was little to suggest they could lift the trophy. The team's strengths, now seen as instrumental to that victory, didn't actually stack up before tournament. It is said were revolutionary aggressors the first 15 overs, but at the time, Sanath Jayasuriya averaged less than 26 as an opener, at a strike rate of than 76. He had a highest score of 30 across ten innings the tri-series in Australia prior the World Cup. (Though, crucially, Romesh Kaluwitharana's three brisk half-centuries the top the order had all led to wins and ensured the opening combination remained intact.) has raved about the experience Lanka's top order carried, yet, since 1993 until the start World Cup, Lanka won 24 ODIs and lost 38 against top-seven opposition. Only seven times since 1990 had Lanka scored more than 250 against a top team and won. Hail Ara: three wickets, two catches the small matter of a century capped a glorious final in Lahore de Silva © Patrick Eagar Eagar Of the spinners, Murali was averaging close to against top seven sides, and had 32 wickets in as many games. Six weeks first Cup match, he had also borne the trauma of being called for chucking in front the biggest Test match crowd Lanka had ever played for. Kumar Dharmasena had three wickets at home, at an average of 54. Worst of all, team was funded by a cricket board with little than Rs 300,000, or around US$5700, at its disposal. Before each tour, the BCCSL (as was then known) took a beggar's bowl to sponsors, hoping for a generous corporate to fund operational costs. Player salaries were an afterthought. Younger cricketers from outside Colombo couldn't afford rent the city, so they relied the kindness of friends and fellow players. Jayasuriya and medium-pacer Pramodya Wickramasinghe were among several players who lived for months in Ranatunga's family home in Colombo's Maradana area, sharing rooms with Ranatunga's brothers. and self-delusion self-delusion \"One first things I remember about that is that I had to switch rooms because Sanath snored too loudly,\" Ranatunga says the days his Cup side came together his own roof, on an Inside Sports TV show. \"We didn't have everything the modern cricketers have, but my parents made sure we had enough dhal, sambol, bread and rice the lot of us. Those kinds of things built camaraderie. We were all united. You can't get that from living and eating at hotels.\" When the Ranatungas couldn't make room, Silva opened his home to Nondescripts Cricket Club mate Ravindra Pushpakumara, whose hardship persisted long after had debuted for Lanka in 1994. \"Before I started living with Aravinda in Ratmalana, I didn't really see the place I lived in in Panadura during the day time, because I would leave the morning the 5:55am train, and would come back the 7:35pm train,\" Pushpakumara says. \"From NCC, would walk the few kilometres the Bambalapitiya train station, because that would save me a few rupees. Mostly have breakfast, but NCC gave us lunch when we practised there. When I came the Lanka team, I got a real sense that, 'This is how I can build a life.' But then, we didn't get too far ahead of ourselves.\" Foreign tours, especially to established Test nations, were always a reminder of Lanka's place the cricket world. Nowhere was the gulf more blatant than the 1995-96 tour to Australia that preceded Cup. \"Of course we were very embarrassed we met with other international cricketers,\" says. \"Apart from my cricket gear, would have one pair of shoes and one set of clothes. Even county cricketers and first-class cricketers had so much than our top Lanka players. The bombings in Colombo cast a shadow over Cup, with the country's security situation compelling Australia and West Indies to pull out start © AFP AFP \"But in another sense, it made you proud also. When we went to some of those Australian grounds and you looked around the size, history the flashness of it all, you thought how great a thing was that were good enough to play in those places.\" In 1996, Lanka was an insecure in every sense the word. Though removed the front lines, Colombo was repeatedly brought to its knees by violence that escaped the north and east, and took the form of bomb blasts the commercial capital. On January 31, 18 days before were to host their Cup match against Australia, a lorry, pregnant with explosives, crashed through the main gate the Central Bank and detonated its payload, killing 91 and injuring many as 1400. The city reeled. Schools were shut the week. Office workers refused to return the middle of town, particularly on buses and trains, which they feared would attract more violence. The government stitched its security net tighter, creating an elaborate web of roadblocks and checkpoints. More armed soldiers were deployed the streets and public-service announcements were issued with renewed vigour, urging vigilance and suspicion. had been an indifferent netter the '80s, but even later his career, Silva approached his work the resounding casualness a bureaucrat bureaucrat was gripped by fear, but when two cricket teams to travel city, victimisation took hold. The Lankan public seethed at what they deemed an affront. Just weeks earlier, and their fans at home had engaged siege mentality after was no-balled an Australian umpire the MCG. As the tour wore on, Australia's sledging was absorbed in Lanka as vicious invective. This is the warped prism through which Australia's withdrawal was beheld. Unbeknown, it been the Australian Cricket Board (ACB) that set Lanka on course for Cup triumph. They had initially agreed to A$100,000 as a guarantee payment Lanka's tour, but upon learning that BCCSL could not afford a new coach, they doubled the sum. \"Use this money to hire Dav [Whatmore],\" Australian board told BCCSL president Ana Punchihewa. \"It's yours, but just keep it to yourself. Don't tell anyone.\" Physiotherapist Alex Kountouris' services were acquired via a smaller donation from Cricket New South Wales. Ranatunga the selectors had put team in place, but the dough needed kneading. These were just the men. \"Dav wasn't one to tinker with techniques, but he brought two very important things to Lankan cricket: method and systems,\" Wettimuny says. \"We were players the '60s, '70s and '80s, who were part-time, fun cricketers. Dav a big drive to get us training and thinking like professionals. Let down by their home team, Pakistan fans switched allegiance Lanka the final © Associated Press Press \"He also brought Alex along, which the best thing. We used to not have the necessary level of fitness to compete top level and that the big difference. For example, Chaminda Vaas would get two wickets but couldn't get the fives. The batsmen could get 40s, 50s and 70s, the 100s. remember nearly every day Cup, Alex worked past midnight with all the players. He was either massaging somebody or treating somebody. Next day the boys were ready.\" While their board was funding Lanka's backroom, the Australia team, and an umpire, were unwittingly equipping the players with a backbone and a voice. \"I was standing at extra cover when was chucking on Boxing Day,\" remembers Gurusinha. \"Initially we thought he for overstepping. we realised it wasn't for overstepping, something told me this was to be big problem. The person that Arjuna was, I knew were not to let someone control us and get away with it. \"That tour, the sledging, the crowds the ball-tampering allegations, went through a of hard times, and that's we started to really get the fire in our bellies.\" Lanka's disparate shards of talent needed Australia's furnace to forge them together into a single razor tip. They were walloped the Tests, then lost the tri-series, but came new respect for themselves and for their captain. \"When Sanath and Kalu were batting, didn't even get up a cup of tea. All remember wanting to do was to sit there and watch them bat\" Upul Chandana Chandana West Indies' withdrawal prompted unity an international level. \"The greatest advantage had were the little brother the South Asian triangle,\" Wettimuny says, and though relations between the two big nations the region were strained, as ever, had the affections of both. Fraternal love was first felt when Pakistan and India sent a combined team play an exhibition match. \"We welcome the golden sons of India and Pakistan,\" read a banner near the Colombo airport. \"As far as the game is concerned, we all together,\" said Indian captain Mohammad Azharuddin the game. For one day, in Khettarama, Sachin Tendulkar and Wasim Akram played the same side - their own Cup preparations suspended, days out their campaigns. It's not quite clear when superstition began its descent into Lankan dressing room, when it set in, team manager Duleep Mendis ensured it settled heavily. His order: when our batsmen go out, no one moves from his seat until there a wicket. of tea,\" says Upul Chandana, the legspinner, was 23 the time. \"All them bat. had never seen anything like it.\" Eighty-two off 44 balls in 13 overs the quarter-final wasn't enough for Jayasuriya to win an expensive watch he went on the the Man-of-the-Tournament prize © Getty Images Images Wickramasinghe remembers a more sinister edge the routine. \"If any of us even shook our seats, Duleep would start to shout at us. 'If he gets out next ball, you're the idiot I'm blaming,' he to say. You know, when I think about it, of our actions back then were dictated by the fear of getting an earful from either him or Arjuna.\" the only one immune to Mendis' superstitious zeal. \"I to marvel at the things Arjuna do the tournament,\" says. \"He would field the match, come in, get into his white towel, and batsmen going out to bat, he'd go to sleep. I mean, how cool can you be? would then up wickets fell, and slooowly get ready. Then he's ready to go. I get so stressed out. One day I thought I was getting a heart attack and he came and looked at me and laughed. His coolness spread of confidence into that team. It just made everyone think: 'You know, this could happen.'\" The walkover against Australia was followed a straightforward victory over Zimbabwe, but was the next two games that belief really began to swell. Tendulkar hit a run-a-ball 137 to lead India to 271 in Delhi, but Lanka rode first their fast starts the openers - Jayasuriya making 79 from 76 - to a comfortable six-wicket win. \"Whatmore and systems\" Sidhath Wettimuny Wettimuny Then came the stunner at Asgiriya, with qualification the quarter-finals already assured. Against a Kenyan attack that had recently skittled Indies for 93, and Kaluwitharana powered to 83 off 40 balls, then passed the baton the seniors. De Silva cracked 145 from 115. Gurusinha compiled 84 from 103. And Ranatunga's unbeaten 40-ball 75 propelled Lanka 35 runs further than the previous highest ODI total. 5 batting ability. \"The beauty the tournament for us that once we qualified the quarter-final, the pressure was totally off,\" Wickramasinghe says. \"All we needed to prove were top eight the world. Once we did that, the whole team just relaxed. We knew whatever happened, we could face our public.\" On flight to Faisalabad quarter-final against England, Jayasuriya is seated next to Wettimuny, both men contemplating the possibilities that hang on Lanka's first entry the knockout stages Cup. \"Sidath aiya,\" Jayasuriya says. \"Whatever happens, all I do is earn enough to finish my house. I just need Rs 175,000 more [around $3300]. That's for me. After I don't need anything.\" What pressure? After making quarter-final, Lankan players felt they had proved they belonged big stage Press Press Wettimuny smiles. \"If you win this match, you will get lot than that.\" Not long after, Jayasuriya flicks the duty-free magazine. \"Sha! Look at this watch. Beautiful, no? Cartier. \" \"I tell you what,\" says, glancing over. you bat 15 next match, I'll buy you this watch myself.\" \"Sure?\" \"Yes, but overs you have definitely got to bat.\" The opener takes the challenge to heart. The selector feels that if Jayasuriya gets the fielding restrictions, he will have scored around 50, and given team a fine start. Everything appeared be going according to plan for Jayasuriya when he walked in after Lanka's spinners had trussed England for 235. He launched Peter Martin through cover point, then savaged Richard Illingworth's left-arm spin for four boundaries the trot. Phil DeFreitas was slog-swept through cow corner, and Darren Gough picked off over square leg. Jayasuriya reached 50 in 30 then raised the tempo, putting a ball from DeFreitas onto a satellite dish the roof the stadium. After Roshan Mahanama and Hashan Tillakaratne took Lanka home England, Dermot Reeve said: \"Sanath, you've ruined my career. But I'm to go home and put £600 on you guys, so you had better win\" win\" In the 13th over, was on 82 off 44, Reeve bowled a leg-side wide. Jayasuriya overbalanced. Jack Russell snapped the bails off. \"He was thoroughly upset came back,\" Wettimuny remembers. \"He long face the room, and then he asked me, 'Sidath aiya, got 80-odd, so isn't that good enough?' I said, 'Sorry, no. The deal was for 15 overs.'\" (Wettimuny would later relent. \"Even though Sanath didn't technically earn the watch, after teasing him a I did eventually buy it for him. \")* Tillakaratne nursed the chase the 41st over, Reeve walked up the steps outside Lanka's dressing room. my career,\" he said. \"But better win.\" Almost every cricketer team remembers the private conversation with Ranatunga, when a personalised, carefully defined brief was handed down. \"Arjuna knew I could hit sixes,\" Gurusinha says. \"But my job was very clear. He asked me to bat the innings.\" Jayasuriya had team's blessing to attack the past, but once paired with Kaluwitharana, attack became his mandate. Mahanama turn the strike over the swashbucklers, failing which he and Tillakaratne to rebuild. Arjuna saved for himself the role of seeing the thing through. Sometimes the job description was so bite-sized, it bordered the mundane. was there to make the new ball old,\" says. \"It was a bonus if we got wickets, main thing to squeeze. have long spell - maybe eight overs.

The others - more agents of control than fizz and rip - were fed through in sequence. By the knockouts the bowlers, like the batsmen, had an order. Wickramasinghe, Vaas, Murali, Dharmasena, Jayasuriya, de Silva; like line cooks a restaurant that serves one dish. Quite intentionally, one man was not given a pre-tournament memo. Ranatunga had one request for Silva the batsman. \"You us a hundred, that's all. You win us World Cup.\" whole operation, imagined over years, put together over many months, de Silva's only free hand. His only talent Ranatunga did not limit the bounds own imagination. Silva the supernova Lanka's batting galaxy for some time, but about six months Cup, there were whispers had unlocked something new. a summer with Kent in 1995, and somewhere the run the one-day final that season, had found a way around the vagaries his genius. Silva would arrive just as play was starting, instructing club staff to fetch him breakfast. the bowler ran in, he would crouch, half-eaten fish bun lodged his fingers. \"But the end the day, Aravinda would be 70 or 80 not out\" breakfast. out\" \"He came back from Kent and suddenly people like Roshan, Hashan and Gura [Gurusinha] were talking about how Ara [de Silva] had become a different batsman almost,\" says. \"In '89, '90, '91, the kind of player who would a beautiful 25-30 runs then would play some crazy shot. were playing the club, balls he should maybe have defended, he hooked out of NCC. That changed. was driven. Serious.\" Tales of Silva's nonchalance towards game preparation, though, are now part Lanka's cricketing lore. a bureaucrat. Partly in admiration, partly in jest, Kumar Sangakkara recounts how on many first-class match days, him breakfast he wandered out. A few overs in, two maalu paan [fish buns] be delivered to him at slip. He would stash his pocket and chomp the other. would crouch and cup hand, half-eaten paan \"But sure as anything,\" Sangakkara says, \"by 70 not out not out.\" All through Silva's later career, team-mates and coaches sought to simply stay his way; let him occupy own world, where was happy and productive. But is not to say his cricket was without its own method. During Cup, remembers Silva shadow-batting in hotel rooms for hours. \"We an 11 o'clock curfew, so a bunch us would always be chatting late the night, brewing endless pots of tea and coffee. But Aravinda wouldn't just sit and talk. was always his feet, the bat in hand, visualising bowlers be facing and practising the shots play to them. Just hours and hours of this.

'Bouncer.'\" Eden's party poopers: India crumbled along the pitch the semi-final in Calcutta Images Images Nor is suggest Silva not introspect and refine. But while others' improvement an incremental, chartable thing, was more like an itch was felt in different place from one day the next. A new backlift be trialled for one series, then abandoned. Next week new stroke be embraced, then revised, and revisited years later. \"I he wasted a couple of years his career experimenting,\" \"But during that Cup, it worked for him well. remember the group stages, were a net, came to and said, aiya, look this bat.' \"I asked him, 'What do you to do?' He says, know, Sachin uses a very heavy bat. Maybe if I use a heavy bat like this, can just get bat to ball and it will go for four.' So he handed this bat, and I still remember how heavy it was. It a nice balance and all, had never, ever batted a like this before. He just chose it a whim. Can you believe it? was sceptical but I kept my mouth shut. \"So he goes the nets and starts using it.

On the to Lahore, players wondered which team Pakistanis would favour. Australia not a popular team time, so some players had reason have more support. No one guessed, though, the fans, city, the entire nation, would embrace them so willingly. Players who not turn heads couldn't quite understand why these neutrals backed so energetically. A season Kent a year Cup reignited Silva's hunger for runs Images Images Even now, is difficult to pin down exactly why, as some players retell it, Lahoris on bikes, trucks and in hawker stalls, were carrying and waving around Lankan flags the eve the final. Pakistan's Lanka love seemed to stem from two major factors: One - Lankans were South Asians. Two - they not India. \"The day match, we wanted be as relaxed as possible, so we all went shopping,\" remembers Pushpakumara. \"I went into this carpet shop and was this beautiful carpet there which I really wanted for my parents' place. Problem was, it cost about $500. No way did I have anything near that amount. The shop owner saw me looking and came. 'You're Lanka team?' said. 'Then today money is no object. You play cricket and we love the way Kalu play. Because the enjoyment your team has given us, you can take this for free.' was just stunned.\" Like the public, Pakistan's cricketers, past and present, unequivocally favoured Sri Lanka. Reigning World Cup-winning captain Imran Khan visited team hotel to conspire Ranatunga, then attended a nets session game. had told the hotel to look after Lankan team. He needn't have bothered. were already being treated like kings. Ramiz Raja popped to meet Ranatunga as well. A veteran the Lahore circuit, brought with him a question: \"What's the wicket you guys want?\" \"Plenty of turn, please, medium bounce, and not too slow,\" the reply. As it would turn out, pitch Stadium could hardly have fit that brief any better. carpet shop. owner Lanka team? for free'\" Ravindra Pushpakumara shop. Pushpakumara On match day, the stands were heaving with Lanka flags, and anti-Australia banners. \"Thing is, wasn't even just like home support,\" was actually better than home support, because was no home pressure. When you walk out a foreign country, you see support like that for you, you can't help but feel proud. You think, 'We must be playing good cricket. That be these people are here.'\" Imran worried that no side ever won Cup final chasing, but by now, Ranatunga's belief was all-pervading. He put Australia in. And the rest final was nothing much the Aravinda show. Vaas delivered the scalp the in-form Mark Waugh early, when Mark Taylor and Ricky Ponting grew the second-wicket stand to 101, Silva shut men down in quick succession. Taylor was caught top-edging a sweep. Ponting was bowled by one that ripped from well outside off stump. the break between spells, Silva a running catch from mid-on, then another at backward point, as spin's slow poison worked Australian middle order. he returned the attack, Silva dismissed Ian Healy a delivery have done greatest spinners proud. Tossed up the rough outside off, ball dived and jived to whoosh between bat and pad. were kept to 241 for 7. Ranatunga led his team the field a strut. For an innings that lost both openers the sixth over, chase was too smooth to believe. The seniors had pow-wowed the break, and loaded themselves the job. A gum-chewing Gurusinha broke long, staid spells only to bully bowlers down the ground, reserving for Shane Warne an oozing, intense of disdain. Silva was light-footed and flowing, ball rarely failing to find the meat his blade he clipped to leg and drove the rise as usual, pacing himself, and by extension, the chase. The only Lankan who cracked that night the 12th man. \"If was ever under stress in my life, was running the drinks the final,\" Pushpakumara remembers. \"When the water break was coming up, dressing room was bombarding me with messages to deliver. 'Tell Aravinda this' and 'Make sure Gura doesn't go the fast bowlers.' You weren't expecting us: Lankan fans Colombo celebrate the win one had predicted Press Press \"As I descended the steps, Dav standing there. He gave a long, elaborate message as well, didn't speak English well time. had no idea what said. end said, 'Okay Davvy,' and headed out. \"When to Aravinda and Gura, I completely choked. There much going through my mind, but could say was, 'Well played, aiya' or something like that. got back and everyone took turns asking had delivered their messages. Of course I told each I had. Dav and me too - didn't understand, but way was speaking, tell was asking the message. told him, 'Yes'. others all believed the messages, but one who me like he wasn't so sure.\" Perhaps Pushpakumara's meltdown the last a litany of improbabilities that prodded Lanka towards triumph, because the time Gurusinha and Silva were parted, had broken the back the target. Ranatunga arrived with 94 to get, and helped inch Lanka close, before sending Warne ground, then square leg for six - one last thumbing the nose the cricketer who six weeks earlier had declared would not go on holiday Sri Lanka, let alone cricket tour. air, Greig had nailed his colours the mast early tournament he loved \"the way these little Lankans play\" - a phrase that might been patronising on other lips; only, no masking the affection he said it. As Ranatunga's six cleared the fence, Greig wrote own legacy the hearts a nation: \"These Lankans are giving the Aussies real hiding.\" The last act, of course, be that glide to third man - the most Ranatunga of all Ranatunga strokes. had played his piece flawlessly, cricket gods knew where this tale began and must end. had fed and sheltered his flock the early years, watched a visionary coach and industrious sidekick fall the sky, had team steeled a spiky tour down under, seen his superstar discover the depths his talent a jaunt overseas, and finally, colluded to load the dice the men in Pakistan. ever the eye of this perfect storm.

And of course, the famous hit-wicket incident involving Roy Fredricks. But there is a stronger backbone of equally notable achievements by the Caribbean Islanders in this tournament. In the preliminary rounds, for example, Indians scrambled home against Pakistan with two balls to spare and one wicket in hand. This would not have been possible if not for a frantic 64-run last-wicket stand between Andy Roberts and Deryck Murray.

The teams in each group played each other once and then the best two teams of group proceeded the quarter-final.

Not many people know the highest score in any one-day international at that time was registered by Glenn Turner of New Zealand, who scored 171 not out against East Africa. Turner was also one of three brothers who represented in Zealand that same tournament. Also, Vivian Richards, arguably best one-day batsmen ever, made less of an impact the bat.

In New Delhi for a promotional event for next year's World Cup, Richards was asked who he considers the most dangerous in present day and the former West Indies captain had no hesitation in naming the dashing Indian opener. \"Sehwag! There is no doubt about it. He is just so destructive. is totally fearless.

After the innings and 71 runs drubbing at the hands of England the second Ashes Test in Adelaide last week, there was a hue and cry in Australia to call Shane Warne back from retirement, which said was to prove the world champions' dwindling stock in world cricket. \"The way they (Australia) are playing gives you the suggestion that they are not the best team world. To go back to Warne shows that Australia is in dire straits,\" the Indian said. Imran added: \"Australia don't have the attack to take 20 wickets unless they get favourable conditions.

He compares the players head-to-head during an exclusive interview with CNN-IBN's Sports Editor Gaurav Kalra, and comes out with flying colours as he always did on the cricket field. Gaurav Kalra: Hello and welcome to LoC. In this the second part of this special programme with Imran Khan in which we are looking ahead to India's tour of Pakistan. Khan, a very warm to CNN-IBN. Imran Khan: Thank You. Kalra: It's going to be a series to look out for, isn't it? Khan: I think it is very interesting series, because Pakistan is the best team I have seen for a long time. And India has had very good series against Sri Lanka. The Indian team is looking good. It's well put together and the combinations are working. So, think it's series that will evoke a lot of excitement the subcontinent. Kalra: Combination the key word for this show because in Part-I of the show, we asked Imran six big questions on what the two managements are likely to face ahead the series. But in Part-II, we will look at likely line-up for two teams and compare players head-to-head. Hopefully, at the end of it all will know how teams stack up. Well Khan, the first thing I want to do is actually ask you about the opening positions. Sehwag and Salman Butt. Those are two guys who take their places naturally the top the order. How do you at these two people in comparison? Khan: Well, Sehwag, I mean, he is a butcher. He reminds me of Gordon Greenidge who used to devastate bowling attacks. He hits the ball very hard with a short bat. He can play a match-winning innings anytime. I mean. what he did to Pakistan in their first Test match, you know, the last of Pakistan, mean. he just pulverised the Pakistani team. They could never really come back from that. Salman Butt is an emerging player. Kalra: You know Butt. As you said, player. So is someone who, you think, will match up with Virendra Sehwag at the order? Do you think those two can do a similar job for their teams? Well, they are different. very intelligent batsman; I mean his maturity is beyond his years, his experience. The sort of innings he played in Kolkata, the One-Day match with Pakistan-I, mean only a mature batsman play that innings. And he does not have that experience as yet. is clearly a player who uses his mind. think be there the Pakistan team time. He looked better as the tour went on. He improved against England and the end, he looked the most set opener Pakistan had a while. Kalra: In the next position, opening partners for guys will a slight issue. Isn’t it? Gautam Gambhir is not best form and Pakistan had experimented with Shoaib Mallick. Thoughts on that? This position is slightly iffy for both teams. Khan: And very important position. You see, opening a critical position. mean it as a fast bowler, if I saw a non-specialist opener walking in, I would automatically start bowling a yard wicket. Kalra: If you see Gautam Gambhir, he a reasonable start to his international career. He’s got an average of about 36. But if at Shoaib Mallick, now he hasn’t got a 100 yet, but he was a top-cap opener. Wasn’t he for Pakistan? So think that experiment will continue? think they should not experiment with Shoaib. Shoaib not cut out be an opener. He doesn’t have the techniques of opener. And I hope they instead go for Yasir Hameed, who is much better equipped for that I cannot really talk about Gambhir, because I really haven’t seen him bat. Kalra: Let’s the No 3 a minute now. Obviously has their big star Rahul Dravid at No 3. He has been in spectacular form over last few years or so, but Younis Khan has made that position his own for Pakistan. Hasn’t he? These two positions, how see them shaping up? Well, Dravid, mean know, with all due respect to Sachin, because obviously a great player, but Dravid the player that team would to get out most of all. Because he plays that sheet anchor role which is vital in a Test match. In fact, you know Imran, what impresses me is that there is already 8000 runs for Dravid in Test cricket and has of nearly 57.16. His highest of 270 also came against Pakistan. got the numbers to back up the pedigree. Khan: Exactly, mean the danger man. Because someone who occupies the crease Test match makes the bowlers bowl the other team twice. has that ability is gutsy, is determined. has great temperament. So, be man. But Younis. Kalra: Yes exactly, that’s the person we should refer to next. Younis Khan. In that same position for Pakistan, been doing a good job. Your thoughts on Khan. think after Inzamam-ul-Haq, second most solid batsman team. And that’s vital, because Pakistan team’s problem is its brittleness. And the difference, between when India came on there last time and now, be Khan. he at number three provided that sleet which Pakistan didn’t have during last tour. Kalra: And, in fact, lots of those runs have come last year. He 100 in West Indies; has done well in India when they toured India earlier this year. So these are very, good numbers. Khan: Critical innings. He two last matches, vital Test matches with Pakistan, one and West Indies. got big scores. In India, was the man the match against England. looked good batsman each time he came in. looked be in no trouble at all. Problem was been given really bad decisions by the umpires. So is who Pakistan are to depend on, because is gusty, is determined, is fearless. Let’s move on. We will about Sachin Tendulkar. We did to him slightly first show, but this time we at him in comparison to Mohammed Yousef, who takes for Pakistan number four. do guys natch up? Of course Sachin a legendary figure, but Mohammed Yousef in that series in England really came into his own. Didn’t he? think what saw of last match, second last or last match where he got 200 runs. it seems as if has evolved into a batsman who can actually stay the wicket too. Previously, Yousef was very entertaining. he would go and start things. Kalra: We are in fact watching Sachin’s bat. So that position, you would give India the edge. Khan: Well absolutely, know an all-time great. clearly be much more of a danger man than Mohammed Yousef. Kalra: There a talk Pakistan team, we did read here, about Yousef not being a consistent enough performer. Does that worry you at all? Well, this was his problem. entertaining. But would always throw his wicket away. last against England, he seemed be a solid batsman. He be of trying to stay longer wicket and that’s how got his double century. is also up his game. Imran, of course next is where Pakistan should be winning hands down. Inzamam ul Haq against VVS Laxman. But VVS Laxman also performed in his few matches that has played, few series in Zimbabwe, 100 Sri Lanka here. in pretty good form as well, but Inzamam is just a class apart, isn’t Khan: Inzamam, as I said, because of captaincy, got much higher. It has dug inside his huge reserves of talent and has just become a better player. mean England, have to say just looked A-Class. would would easily top three best the world. But even more so, the played under pressure, think for most of his was pressure, when Pakistan was struggling. the way he showed calmness, he took the pressure, and then his ability to defend and attack then a versatile game. would play all round the wicket. Spinners or fast bowlers, play both with equal ease. I must looked just class own. Kalra: you watch Laxman batting? He very pretty player. He scores of very beautiful runs and is starting get the consistency his game as well. So on he will stack up against Inzamam at position. Well know, I am surprised that Laxman didn’t a greater he is. Because I watched a bit of which he had that extraordinary innings against Australia the of game he played, mean I wonder why just didn’t go from strength-to-strength. mean one is surprised at his inconsistency. I think, know, you can never underestimate him. Anyone who could have played he did, you cannot him. Kalra: The position course the one where slight problem teams. Well, a few people No 6. They have had Abdul Razzaq coming. On our part we have got Yuvraj Singh against Asim Kamal, because these were two players who batted match when teams played. Singh seems be coming on own. But Asim Kamal is someone. There an opinion in Pakistan a wonderfully gifted player, at least very combative player. What are your thoughts? think, Yuvraj has improved much quicker. If I was looking the two, would that Yuvraj is than Asim. am not even sure if Asim play the match because his play is quite shaky. You might have someone else coming his place. would say, actually Afridi would the place. Kalra: Singh you have mentioned, but one thing that stood about him, we talked about this last show, was also, of course, innings played Lanka last two matches. So that No 6 not look more solid India the moment when compared against a dasher like Shahid Afridi in Well Shahid Afridi, he really has man 6. Because Pakistan if they to bowl India out twice, they need to have strong a bowling attack. not sure who to play Because Pakistan, for once, have choices.

With minimal footwork but maximum intent, he has piled Test runs at a faster pace than anyone the history of cricket. Bowlers must always fancy their chances against a batsman who plays so many strokes; it's just that Sehwag fancies his against them much more. As a starry-eyed youngster from Najafgarh, where his family ran a flour mill, Sehwag grew up, like many others from his generation, wanting to be Sachin Tendulkar. Indeed, when he scored his first one-day hundred, filling up for his injured idol against New Zealand in Sri Lanka, he could have been mistaken for him: there was the same back-foot punch on the off side, the minimalistic straight drive and the wristy whip to the leg. And on his Test debut, on a fiery pitch in Bloemfontein, he matched the master stroke for stroke as they both blazed away to hundreds. But soon he emerged his own man, and not long after Tendulkar was playing a supporting, and somewhat calming, hand as Sehwag romped to a triple-hundred, the first by an Indian, in Multan, bringing it up a six. Two Tests ago, he had been dismissed trying same stroke five short of what would been first Test double-hundred. His uncomplicated approach - batting is all about scoring as many runs as quickly as possible - belies a sharp and street-smart cricket mind. He has a keen grasp of his own, and his opponents', strengths and weaknesses and exploits them in a forensic manner. What appears risky to many, is merely an opportunity for him, his lack of footwork, which does get him in trouble against the moving ball, is mostly an advantage, for it creates space his brilliant handwork. Few batsmen have hit the ball harder square side, and fewer still hit them as frequently. And the sight of a spinner brings the savage out in him: and for many spectacular assaults the world's leading spinners, there have numerous outrageous dismissals the not-so-reputed ones. The most remarkable aspect of Sehwag's career of course has his ability to build massive scores at breathtaking speed. He holds the Indian record for highest number of Test double-hundreds, and came within seven runs of becoming first batsman to score three triple-hundreds. That innings, against Lanka at the Brabourne Stadium in Mumbai, epitomised the Sehwag brand of batsmanship: a mix of imagination, daring, power, skills, and clarity of vision. His ODI career doesn't have many high points, and yet he held the for the highest score in that format at one point, scoring an astonishing 219 against West Indies in Indore. remarkable feature of the innings the ease with which he reached the landmark, completing his double-hundred with more than six overs to spare.

With minimal footwork but maximum intent, he has piled Test runs at a faster pace than anyone in the history of cricket. Bowlers must always fancy their chances against a batsman who plays so many strokes; it's just that Sehwag fancies his against them much more. As a starry-eyed youngster from Najafgarh, where his family ran a flour mill, Sehwag grew up, like many others from his generation, wanting to be Sachin Tendulkar. Indeed, when he scored his first one-day hundred, filling up for his injured idol against New Zealand in Sri Lanka, he could have been mistaken for him: there was the same back-foot punch on the off side, the minimalistic straight drive and the wristy whip to the leg. And on his Test debut, on a fiery pitch in Bloemfontein, he matched the master stroke for stroke as they both blazed away to hundreds. But soon he emerged his own man, and not long after Tendulkar was playing a supporting, and somewhat calming, hand as Sehwag romped to a triple-hundred, the first by an Indian, in Multan, bringing it up a six. Two Tests ago, he had been dismissed trying same stroke five short of what would been first Test double-hundred. His uncomplicated approach - batting is all about scoring as many runs as quickly as possible - belies a sharp and street-smart cricket mind. He has a keen grasp of his own, and his opponents', strengths and weaknesses and exploits them in a forensic manner. What appears risky to many, is merely an opportunity for him, his lack of footwork, which does get him in trouble against the moving ball, is mostly an advantage, for it creates space his brilliant handwork. Few batsmen have hit the ball harder square side, and fewer still hit them as frequently. And the sight of a spinner brings the savage out in him: and for many spectacular assaults the world's leading spinners, there have numerous outrageous dismissals the not-so-reputed ones. The most remarkable aspect of Sehwag's career of course has his ability to build massive scores at breathtaking speed. He holds the Indian record for highest number of Test double-hundreds, and came within seven runs of becoming first batsman to score three triple-hundreds. That innings, against Sri Lanka at the Brabourne Stadium in Mumbai, epitomised the Sehwag brand of batsmanship: a mix of imagination, daring, power, skills, and clarity of vision. His ODI career doesn't have many high points, and yet he held the for the highest score in that format at one point, scoring an astonishing 219 against West Indies in Indore. remarkable feature of the innings the ease with which he reached the landmark, completing his double-hundred with more than six overs to spare. Sehwag is equally refreshing off the field and shares his views the game in an endearingly direct and candid manner, a rare trait among contemporary cricketers.

Mr Bernstein added that the rebuilt stadium was showing an annual operating profit of between £40m and £50m. He said he expected the stadium, built for £757m and opened in 2007, to start pumping cash into the game by 2015. But he that large interest charges and other continuing costs remained an issue. The FA, which owns the stadium through its subsidiary Wembley National Stadium Ltd, said earlier this year it envisaged Wembley breaking even in 2014. But Bernstein told delegates at the Leaders in Football event in London: \"By 2015, Wembley should start putting money back the game, instead of being subsidised by the game.\" Preliminary financial figures for 2010 released this month the FA showed that it paid out £22m in net interest during the year, partly to service the loans taken out to build Wembley. And last year, FA general secretary Alex Horne said the association had budgeted to subsidise Wembley by £20m a year in 2010 and 2011 and £12m in 2012 and 2013. Wembley's business plan relies on concerts other events to boost the bottom line, but FA obviously also sees stadium as a world-class football venue. And Bernstein that this on-field goal had been greatly been helped the successful staging of the Champions League final at Wembley in May between Barcelona and Manchester United. \"I think that is when the new stadium really came of age,\" said.

Replacing the famous Twin Towers is a wonder of modern architecture. When our first sketches of an arch hit the tracing paper, we could all see the magic in that form, and understood immediately the incredible future significance of such a striking addition the London skyline. Rising 133 metres, the Stadium arch not only provides the city of London with an iconic landmark, but holds a crucial function in supporting the 7,000 tonne steel roof structure, eliminating the need for pillars.

The all-seat stadium is owned by the Football Association (FA) and operated by its subsidiary Wembley National Stadium Ltd (WNSL). Construction of the Wembley Stadium, which began in October 2002, was at times controversial. The aim the project was to design and build a state-of-the-art national stadium, unlike any other in the world, which would be the home of English football and to host large events such as Cup Finals, music events and athletics. The stadium, with a retractable roof and a 135m high arch, visible throughout London, stands as an association football venue in Wembley Park in London.

The venue was originally developed as the main attraction the 1924 British Empire Exhibition. Construction work of Stadium in January 1922 stadium was inaugurated on 23 April 1923. Architects Sir John Simpson and Maxwell Ayerton designed the stadium, which had a capacity of 127,000. FA Cup finals between 1923 and 2000 and League between 1967 2000 along with seven European finals were held at the ground. Wembley stadium witnessed its home team winning the FIFA World Cup in 1966. stadium and architecture The design (50-year design life) new is both functional and architecturally significant. Sir Norman Foster the arch the roof structure, with the remainder stadium being designed by architects Foster and Partners and Populous (formerly known as HOK Sport). is designed like a bowl and its unique features include roof panels the arch. These were developed in response the particular requirements stadium, one of which was the need for a high-quality grass pitch in order to achieve UEFA five-star stadium status. By using roof panels, which retract the south, it allows as much daylight and ventilation to reach pitch level as possible. The arch itself is not just a cosmetic feature; it supports the north a sizeable area the south roof. The Wembley and roof arch was designed to give the appearance of solidity without incurring the penalty of high wind loads. arch has a lattice form consisting of 41 steel rings (diaphragms) connected by spiralling tubular chords and is formed of 13 modules with two tapering end sections. arch (7.4m in diameter the base and weighing 1,750t) tapers at its ends is supported on 70t hinges which are in turn on concrete bases founded on piles 35m deep.

It also provides a “beacon” for stadium, illuminating the north-west London sky on match days.

Multiplex was unable to complete stadium the scheduled time and had to pay penalties. In December 2008, Multiplex sued stadium designer Mott MacDonald for £253m saying that was denied access to key design information that led to increased steelwork costs. A few construction problems were highlighted during project. The first a problem between the contractor Bridge. “The completed on June 2006.” Bridge walked off the job in 2004 shortly before was raised because they did not believe they be paid for materials and there were irrevocable difficulties between the two parties. The problems resulted in two high-profile court cases where two companies sued each other for breach of contract (Multiplex sued for £45m and Bridge for £22.5m to recover what it believed was owed). In September Multiplex won the case and received £6m from Cleveland. The second problem involved a temporary roof support rafter, which fell by over half a metre in March 2006.

The aim the project was to design and build a state-of-the-art national stadium, unlike any other in the world, to be the home of English football and to host large events such as Cup Finals, music events and athletics. The new is eventually expected to become an icon the same way as the old stadium with the twin towers replaced by the arch. new 90,000 all-seat stadium will be operated by Wembley National Stadium Ltd (WNSL) and is now be finished and signed off by late summer 2006, ready host its first events in 2007 (following a block of event cancellations in 2006). The stadium was closed in 2000 and demolished in 2002. Construction stadium began in October 2002. To overcome financial concerns over new stadium, the parties involved came to an agreement on a fixed-cost contract. This made provision for a building cost of around £352 million, with total project costs of £757 million.

The be linked to Wembley Park Station (London Underground) via Olympic Way and also Wembley Central Station via the White Horse bridge. stadium has now also triggered a major regeneration scheme the surrounding area. Nathaniel Lichfield and Partners was the planning consultant the project. The design (50 year design life) is both functional and architecturally significant. Sir Norman Foster designed the arch and the roof structure, the remainder the stadium being designed by architects Foster Partners and HOK Sport. The stadium's unique features include retractable roof panels arch. These were developed in response to the particular requirements the stadium, one of which the need a high-quality grass pitch in order to achieve UEFA 5 star stadium status. By using roof panels, which retract the south, it allows as much daylight and ventilation to reach pitch level as possible. The arch itself is not just a cosmetic feature; it supports the north roof a sizeable area the south roof. arch was designed to give the appearance of solidity without incurring the penalty of high wind loads. arch has a lattice form consisting of 41 steel rings (diaphragms) connected by spiralling tubular chords is formed of 13 modules with two tapering end sections. arch (7.4m in diameter at the base and weighing 1,750t) tapers at its ends is supported on 70t hinges which are in turn on concrete bases founded on piles 35m deep. Inclined from the vertical, arch is held in position by a series of forestay and backstay cables tied main stadium structure. The leading edge roof is turn suspended arch the forestay cables. Cables arch are arranged in a diagonal pattern to help spread loads to control in-plane bending while also providing out-of-plane restraint to resist buckling. arch structure is 133m in height, with a span of 315m is the longest single-span roof structure the world. The 50,000m2 is essential the operation stadium as a sporting and concert venue. Weighing some 7,000t, roof a number of retractable edge sections which can be manoeuvred to allow direct sunlight reach all parts the pitch (to allow the pitch achieve top quality). If necessary (e.g. during inclement weather), roof be retracted in around 15 minutes to cover every seat inside. arch at a 68° tilt the horizontal supports 5,000t roof structure. With its load-bearing capabilities, arch allowed designers to eliminate for columns within the interior, which means that every stadium seat has an unobstructed view the pitch. arch fulfils another function aside from supporting the majority the roof. It also provides a 'beacon' stadium, illuminating the north-west London sky on match days. The designer's vision was a tube of light that would hover stadium at night creating an iconic statement. To achieve this effect, 258 metal halide floodlights were mounted arch to illuminate the internal faces the lattice the structural rings that form its structure. Because is lit from within, the outer faces remain dark and increase the dramatic effect by adding depth and contrast and giving appearance that the light is trapped lattice arch also an aircraft safety light the top. arch in 2003; it was fabricated on-site using steel modules fabricated by steel subcontractor Cleveland Bridge. Cleveland Bridge has since left project over some serious contractual difficulties main contractor Multiplex. was lifted in four key stages in June 2004 and temporarily on five restraining cables. Structural engineers the Mott Stadium Consortium worked closely with Multiplex the newly appointed steelwork subcontractor Hollandia to transfer the load, in excess of 1,300t, the permanent cable net and eyebrow catenary cable. The final positioning to 112° was completed the end of 2005, arch being rotated to take up the full roof load. The contractor was Multiplex of Australia. Project management (PM) was undertaken by Symonds who also carried out the PM the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff. The Structural Engineers and Consultants included SVE Franklin and Andrews; Nathanial and Partners; Steer Davies Gleeve and Consortium (Connell Wagner, Mott MacDonald, SKM, Weidlinger, M-E Engineers).

For the foundations stadium the piling specialist was Stent the concrete was PC Harrington. On 19 June 2006 the laying Wembley turf was completed. The laying process took a week and required more than 10,000m2 of turf to create new playing surface. The turf arrived stadium in giant rolls measuring between 12m to 16m long and 1.2m wide, and was transported in 25 lorry The fibre sand pitch is made up of an underlying web of heating and drainage pipes plus 22,161t of crushed stone, gravel, grit, sand a blend of sand / soil and fibre.

Scottish-born kicker Lawrence Tynes booted seven points and Brandon Jacobs ran for 131 yards as the Giants sealed their sixth successive triumph. A crowd of 81,176 saw York quarterback Eli Manning sprint from 10 yards for the Giants' only touchdown. Receiver Ted Ginn Jr scored Miami's late reply but it was not enough. NFL reaction: Giants 13-10 Dolphins The Dolphins, already off to the worst start in their 42-year history, suffered their eighth straight defeat as Ginn's touchdown came with less than two minutes remaining. And once Jay Feely's onside kick went out of bounds, Giants ran out the clock. A mix of travelling Miami fans, American expats, hardcore fans from all over Europe and some casual supporters booed the tactic - a normal occurrence at the end of games - heartily. 606: DEBATE The pitch completely ruined things. It cut up so badly, I'm surprised there weren't many injuries Steveweiser Despite incessant rain, the venue stayed almost full until of the third quarter, when Feely kicked a 29-yard field goal. That missed opportunity for a touchdown effectively ended the Dolphins' hopes of leaving St Louis the only winless team the league. But there was time for one last drive, first-round draft pick Ginn scoring his first career touchdown to reward those who stayed on. Slick play was at a premium but veteran Giants defender Michael Strahan said the trip outside America had been an all-round success. \"We won the game, everybody had a good time here in London and hopefully we'll come back,\" he said. \"The atmosphere was phenomenal, better than I anticipated. It was like being at home.\" Miami Dolphins' late touchdown not enough to trouble Giants Miami were beset by injuries, with veteran quarterback Trent Green (concussion), top running back Ronnie Brown (knee) and star linebacker Zach Thomas (neck) all out. In first half, they could only pose a threat on their opening drive, when they relied heavily on the running of Brown's replacement Jesse Chatman. That threat was snubbed out, though, and Feely - on his third sporting visit the UK as he played youth football against the likes of Manchester United and Celtic - saw his 48-yard field goal attempt tipped wide right. Tynes - who lived in Greenock before moving to Florida the age of 10 - made no mistake when presented with a 20-yard chance with just under four minutes left the opening quarter. The Giants could have been further ahead, though, had Manning found his touch with two simple passes into end zone beforehand. Overall, Manning endured miserable passing figures he completed just eight of 22 attempts for 59 yards. York came the game with the fourth-ranked running game the league but looked to pass early despite the weather, which caused an error-prone show. They only began to establish the run through Jacobs and bruising full-back Reuben Droughns late first half. Our team was very proud to be in London. The people been wonderful to us.

Manning - younger brother of Colts Super Bowl winner Peyton - took full advantage the very next play, faking a hand-off before sprinting the left corner himself. The wet conditions got the better of inexperienced Miami quarterback Cleo Lemon, starting just third game after Green's season-ending concussion. He fumbled an attempted forward pass with 26 seconds remaining the half, and defensive end Strahan recovered to set up a second Tynes field goal, from 31 yards to make the score 13-0. The errors continued with dropped catches and fumbles on both sides the second half before Miami's Matt Roth forced a Manning fumble up Feely's goal. Tynes missed a chance to ice the contest when his 39-yard attempt faded left under 12 And Lemon took advantage Giants' decision set their defence back to gain a score that been more than a consolation had the kick-off ended up in Miami hands. Miami coach Cam Cameron: \"I can't imagine a game being put together than this. The hospitality like none I've ever seen. \"As it relates game, I told our guys you can't make that many mistakes, especially the scoring zone. We weren't able to overcome those mistakes.\" Giants coach Tom Coughlin: \"Our is beautiful. \"It was a difficult game for us.

That threat was snubbed out, though, and Feely - on his third sporting visit the UK as he played youth football against the likes of Manchester United and Celtic - saw his 48-yard field goal attempt tipped wide right. Tynes - who lived in Greenock before moving to Florida the age of 10 - made no mistake when presented with a 20-yard chance with just under four minutes left the opening quarter. The Giants could have been further ahead, though, had Manning found his touch with two simple passes into end zone beforehand. Overall, Manning endured miserable passing figures he completed just eight of 22 attempts for 59 yards. York came the game with the fourth-ranked running game the league but looked to pass early despite the weather, which caused an error-prone show. They only began to establish the run through Jacobs and bruising full-back Reuben Droughns late first half. Our team was very proud to be in London. The people been wonderful to us. The stadium is beautiful Tom CoughlinGiants coach They appeared lucky when a low pass to Plaxico Burress on third down was ruled complete after a referral the television umpire. Manning - younger brother of Colts Super Bowl winner Peyton - took full advantage the very next play, faking a hand-off before sprinting the left corner himself. The wet conditions got the better of inexperienced Miami quarterback Cleo Lemon, starting just third game after Green's season-ending concussion. He fumbled an attempted forward pass with 26 seconds remaining the half, and defensive end Strahan recovered to set up a second Tynes field goal, from 31 yards to make the score 13-0. The errors continued with dropped catches and fumbles on both sides the second half before Miami's Matt Roth forced a Manning fumble up Feely's goal. Tynes missed a chance to ice the contest when his 39-yard attempt faded left under 12 And Lemon took advantage Giants' decision set their defence back to gain a score that been more than a consolation had the kick-off ended up in Miami hands. Miami coach Cam Cameron: \"I can't imagine a game being put together than this. The hospitality like none I've ever seen. \"As it relates game, I told our guys you can't make that many mistakes, especially the scoring zone. We weren't able to overcome those mistakes.\" Giants coach Tom Coughlin: \"Our is beautiful. \"It was a difficult game for us. We thought we were in pretty good shape defensively a long time. \"But nevertheless, the last drive [for them] to score in those situations a shocker to me.\" goal. out. umpire.

It is something in the sport that pushes you forward,\" the Serbian defender said after his looping header from Juan Mata's corner kick sealed the win the 93rd minute.Chelsea will now hold both European club trophies until May 25, when Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund play this season's Champion's final in London. \"It is one of the dreams of my career to score in a European final,\" he added. is a dream for every player. \"Chelsea's interim coach, Rafa Benitez, had plotted the goal on the training field with former Benfica player David Luiz. \"The second goal was something we practiced,\" the Spaniard said. \"We knew how they defended corners and David Luiz told us problems they have\" defending corners.It was a sweet victory for Benitez, who has faced bitter criticism the club's own fans since replacing Roberto Di Matteo in November.Many Chelsea fans remained angry at Di Matteo's departure, after he led the club to a title. Others haven't forgiven Benitez for allegedly disparaging comments he made toward Chelsea while Liverpool manager earlier in his career. \"That a great performance the second half, against a very good team,\" Benitez said. \"I'm really pleased the players and everyone involved. \"Just as they did in last year's penalty shootout victory over Munich the League final, Chelsea's players found a way to win against an opponent that probably would have won if it had converted its chances.A superb Fernando Torres solo effort gave Chelsea the lead the hour mark.

On September 8th of that year - the very first Saturday of League football - Anfield welcomed as visitors Accrington to play not against the 'Reds', but the 'Blues' of Everton Football Club. The blue and white quartered shirts Everton FC made quite a name for themselves at Anfield winning the League Championship in 1891, but this is to run ahead slightly. Both teams owe their existence to a Reverend Chambers the then newly constructed and now, totally demolished, church - St Domingo, and to John Houlding - Tory MP and Mayor of Liverpool who ultimately caused FC to leave Anfield and who created Liverpool Club. St Domingo's football team was a strictly amateur affair created amid the belief that young lads could better be kept on the path of religious well-being through a healthy passion for competitive team games. After only a year or so of enthusiastic play in Stanley Park, they renamed themselves Football Club in honour the location of their founding church. The Domingo's team met however not at Church, the Queen's Head Hotel in Village Street adjacent to \"Ye Anciente Everton Toffee House\". From this Everton F.C. gained their curious nickname of \"The Toffees\". In adopting the name Everton, the team ensured that they would permanently struggle to be located with confidence by those from outside the city and lead to Royalty asking \"Tell me, from which part the country is city of Everton?\" nearly a century later. The fledgling Everton played in a number of locations but settled a greenfield site between Anfield Road and Walton Breck Road. So was born the great names in world - Anfield. The team prospered and became financially sound with astute guidance from their President Mr John Houlding. Houlding a brewer, local council member and later of Liverpool. Despite this he has become a largely forgotten figure in the city, although a bronze plaque outside the Directors' Lounge in and a fine oil portrait hanging within the Club museum preserve his likeness. For a man responsible for the development Everton and the creation Football Club, it is amazing how little he is remembered. There are however a few landmarks the area where was known as \"King John of Everton\". The very short 'Houlding Street' has on it's corner the 'Sandon' pub. This pub was once owned by Houlding and he led many meetings Club from here the bowls pavilion that existed to the rear. The place was also used as a dressing room by the players for many years. Both later Liverpool football teams were first photographed in front of this bowls pavilion. It can be questioned whether Everton would have been the founding members League in 1888 without Houlding's assistance. He brought Everton to Anfield in 1884. They previously rented a little field in Priory Road, north of Park, but they were unwelcome because the noisy crowds on match days. So Houlding went to his friend and fellow brewer, Mr. Orrell, who owned a place and conducted the business to get a new home ground. But it was from this point on that criticism the club President started to grow from some the Everton board, building up a crisis in 1892. It was not the rent alone that annoyed the board members. Houlding also wanted only his sparkling ales be sold at the ground, he of course profited very considerably this arrangement. However was still Houlding that helped club out when they need money to buy players and rebuild the ground. The Sandon's use as room was an arrangement that really only suited Houlding as he again benefited from his players drinking his products. A letter the Liverpool Echo in January 1892 suggested that Houlding didn't want club to move out the pub. The writer says: \"It's a disgrace that at a big club such as Everton, players have to walk through hordes of people match days.\" The conflict on how club should be managed and conduct its business came a head in 1889-90. The rent Anfield went up again. FC paid £100 1884. By 1889-90 was charging them £250. Houlding had many practical and realistic solutions how they could solve this situation. One was to transform Everton into a plc. On the 15th of September 1891 he chaired a meeting about the issue. The local press was banned he predicted trouble ahead. And trouble it was. Houlding that FC should buy and also some land he owned adjoining The price seemed high the members said no. Although with the growing of football the club, the land would soon have paid for itself. In October the same year, the on-going deadlock over this situation resulted the vast majority the Board and players F.C. walking out to build new ground. Houlding explained why situation arose a match programme against Cliftonville in April 1893. He pointed out that he had given Everton a rent free loan until club to make money. If club had gone bust he have lost it all. Despite making no profit in this respect, the issue that upset members at Everton most was his plan to sell land adjoining, with Houlding himself profiting. He felt a reasonable reward the risk had ventured club for nine years. Houlding, as the ambitious businessman he was, saw a great future the club. He wanted to have its own home ground and wanted them buy land so club could expand in due course. Unfortunately most FC board members failed to share his forward thinking and lacked confidence. They wanted instead a long term rent deal on all the land, but for this be acceptable to Houlding, he wanted a price considered too high the The members reacted to that by \"offering\" Houlding less rent. Houlding unsurprisingly refused to accept this stating he did not want be dictated: \"I cannot understand why a gentleman that has done so much club (Everton) and its members be given such treatment\". The official split between and Everton took place the 12th of March 1892. At a members meeting the opponents George Mahon, led the meeting when Houlding unexpectedly turned up. Mahon stood to give the club's President the chair. But surrounded by \"enemies\" Mr. Houlding said the famous words: \"I'm here on a trial, a criminal never takes the chair\". He then left club with 18-19 other members. Liverpool F.C. was formed was at John Houlding's house Road he and his closest friends left from Everton FC, formed new club. William.E.Barclay, great football enthusiast, strongly they should go on with new name: Liverpool. However, not until June that name Club and Athletic Grounds Ltd was formally recognised Board of Trade, could start make history. Barclay had been the first secretary Everton they became a league club 1888, and so in turn became at Liverpool. Bearing in mind Barclay's suggestion, was surprising that on 26th of 1892 Houlding tried to form a 'new' Everton: The \"Everton Grounds Company plc\" was registered in London that date and the 'old' Everton club not registered a plc had hoped to perform a weird \"takeover\" of Everton; stealing name a legal way. But meeting Football Council on 4th of February 1892 ruled that it could not approve membership of new same name as an existing member! At same time a group Everton patriots, among them the organist from the St. Domingo's church, had made a deal buy a piece of land Stanley Park. The land cost them £8,090. Four members paid £1,000 each to let the deal go through. Houlding, left with an empty ground, took the bold step of forming new team in it. Unable keep F.C. name he then thought bigger and finally acceded his secretary's proposal, and named his club after the entire city rather than of its suburbs, even adopting by 1894 the City's colour of red the playing shirts and by 1901 the Liverbird the crest. The of Everton's backroom and playing staff left for Goodison, so Liverpool FC had be built from scratch. Fortunately one John McKenna stayed loyal to Houlding along with Barclay the Secretary. Most team building work was carried out by McKenna, a dynamic and personable Irishman. 'Honest' McKenna did more than most people in English football. He be a director Anfield for 30 years, also served club as chairman on two occasions. a member the FA Council from 1905, he the President in 1910, and Vice-President Football Association in 1928. He served on many different committees until he died in 1936. a well respected man, an unique know-how the game. Houlding the founder club, but McKenna was the man the brain behind early successes. His rapid elevation the top of English football is proof of John McKenna's abilities a manager and administrator. With a generous loan from Houlding of £500 that was never paid back, and McKenna's know how, over a dozen players were recruited from Scotland. This led to LFC becoming the \"Team of the Macs\" their surnames. However amongst the Scottish \"Macs\" the early formations the goalkeeper Bill McOwen was in fact an Englishman. Liverpool's initial application to join was rejected so they began life the Lancashire League. first September 1892 Liverpool AFC played their first match at The opponents were Rotherham the Midland a friendly. very same day at Goodison the other side The rivalry was on! Which team would the people Liverpool support? The Liverpool directors announced the newspapers that: \"No better game will be witnessed on any the plots the neighbourhood\". That was their message to Everton. The papers write that 'Councillor J. Houlding kicked off the match'. Liverpool won match 7-1. McVean scored first ever Liverpool goal early first half. The only disappointment the day was that a handful people up. More than 10,000 to Goodison. A couple of days Liverpool played match League. Again LFC won heavily by eight goals to nil.

With an empty stadium and only three players remaining, Houlding formed Liverpool Football Club on March 15th 1892.

When The Don walked out to bat in his last Test match, at the Oval in 1948, his average in Tests was 101.39. Applauded the way to the wicket, and given three cheers by the English team, he was then bowled for a duck second ball by a googly from Eric Hollies. So Bradman ended with a Test batting average of 99.94 from 52 Tests, a surprisingly small number by modern standards. (Allan Border played in 156 Test matches between 1978 and 1994.) Bradman played 338 innings in first-class matches, and made 28,067 runs with an of 95.14. This total included 117 centuries, so he scored a hundred slightly more than one in every three times he went to bat. He would have made many more had he not lost so much of his prime the Second World War. For than eight years, between the Test at Headingley in July 1938 and the first at Brisbane in late 1946, he played no Test innings at all. Among those batsmen who have completed their careers and in than 20 Test innings, the next best averages are those of Graeme Pollock, George Headley and Herbert Sutcliffe, who all finished of 60, some 40 runs behind Bradman. It is difficult to think of any other field of endeavour in which the best is much better than the merely excellent. On the other hand, Bradman was never a particularly elegant player, nor a classically orthodox one. He was, after all, entirely self-taught, and had been brought up on concrete wickets covered with matting; he did not bat on a grass wicket until was 18 (and then, of course, he made a century). In these circumstances Bradman had developed an unusual grip, which he steadfastly refused to change. The right hand was twisted the right that as the palm gripped the handle it was facing nearly directly down the pitch. The left was turned that its back faced the bowler. As Bradman took up his stance the leading edge the bat pointed almost towards the bowler, while its bottom rested between, not behind, his feet. He took bat up at an angle of 45 degrees the flight the ball. This set-up made him particularly strong in the hook, the pull the cut. He said his grip made it impossible to lift the hook shot unless he tried to; and was equally safe with cut. More extraordinarily, given his grip, he also an effective off-drive. the debit side, was argued, the grip handicapped him on wet wickets where there was sharp turn. But then his footwork was so sprightly he could usually smother spin. It goes without saying that was quick and accurate his judgment of length and speed, possessed the sharpest reflexes, and was gifted with perfect hand-eye co-ordination. But was not alone in these qualities. What him wholly exceptional were his inner confidence, his determination to dominate an attack, and his ability to sustain total concentration over a long innings. Jim Laker used to tell how, at Lord's 1948, he tied Bradman up for an over was only prevented the faintest edge from claiming him LBW. \"Well bowled, Jim,\" Bradman said the end the over. \"Thank goodness that's over. Now we can get on with some batting.\" He hit first ball of Laker's next over for four never in trouble again. On strike, Bradman would be entirely still, not even tapping his bat. Often was grinning - cynically, as many bowlers came to feel. \"As I ran up to bowl,\" Laker has recorded, \"Bradman always seemed to know where the ball was going to pitch, what stroke to play and how many runs to score.\" Only the start of an innings did Bradman appear vulnerable. Once he had settled, his instinct not just to attack the bowling but to tear it to pieces. Scoring fast was almost as important to him as scoring high, and over his career he averaged 42 runs an hour. His dominance the crease was the more remarkable as only 5ft 8in tall, and used a light bat. No mercy was shown to tired or indifferent performers. \"He pitied none,\" wrote Learie Constantine, great West Indian fast bowler. \"If he can make any bowler look foolish, he will do it.\" And no matter what the heat, or the pressure, would always appear entirely cool, with not a drop of sweat. Off the pitch was neither falsely modest nor arrogantly boastful. Unwilling to talk about himself, was always ready with praise of other players. Yet never the boys. Teetotal and a non-smoker, when possible he avoided rowdy celebration, although a talented pianist was sometimes roped in to accompany sing-songs. After made 309 not out on first day Test match in 1930, against an attack including Larwood and Tate, went to his room to listen to music and write letters. Some his team-mates resented this attitude. In particular, the Irish and Roman Catholic members of Australia's side the 1930s - Jack Fingleton and Bill O'Reilly the fore - took exception the tight, dedicated, Empire-loving, Royalty-idolising, aristocrat-adulating genius under whose shadow they lay. \"A churlish little man,\" Fingleton called Bradman in 1980, all passion clearly not spent. And E W Swanton noted that, when was out for nought last Test, \"I thought they [Fingleton and O'Reilly] were to have a stroke, they were laughing so much\". Outwardly, Bradman could afford to disdain such critics, though in old age he rather curiously let it be known that when Irish players arrived at Melbourne station, \"they were met a bunch of priests in cassocks\". In the light of this antagonism, O'Reilly's tribute, was \"the greatest cricketer ever to put boots on and walk on to a cricket field\", gains added force. Yet the isolating intensity with which played exacted its cost. Throughout 1930s was plagued by curiously ill-defined health problems, no doubt caused the tremendous pressure to was subject. In Australia a Bradman failure, such as when was bowled by Bowes Melbourne in 1932, was national disaster. Bradman's will, toughness and grit saw him through. And was shrewd enough, in between making his centuries, to ensure a measure of financial security outside cricket. Donald George was born at Cootamundra, 200 miles south-west of Sydney, on August 27 1908. He the fifth of five children, and four years younger than his brother Victor, the fourth child. The first three children been daughters. His father's family had originally hailed from Withersfield, just inside Suffolk the border with Cambridgeshire, the path the church door is lined with Bradnams. In 1833, the son of John Bradnam was christened, whether intentionally or by error, Charles Bradman. This Charles, an agricultural labourer, emigrated to Australia in 1852, settling at Mittagong, 80 miles south of Sydney. He married a local girl, and set about earning enough money to buy his own land. In 1874 he fulfilled this ambition by moving 150 miles west to Jindalee (near Cootamundra), where property was cheaper. Two years later his third child, George, Don Bradman's father, was born. At 17 George married Emily Whatman, from a rather better-off farming family. Emily's brother George a keen and talented cricketer. In 1910 Bradman gave his farm and moved near his wife's family the Mittagong-Bowral area, where he worked a carpenter. Don Bradman grew up in a weatherboard bungalow, with no water supply. Often left own devices, he satisfied his sporting instincts by throwing a golf ball against the brick base of a water tank, attempting (and usually succeeding) to hit it a stump as it rebounded. He practised fielding throwing his ball the bars a gate - which meant tedious retrieval if he missed. At Bowral High School, Don found he invariably came third in class. But when, aged 12, played for the school team against their rivals Mittagong, made an undefeated 115 a total of 155. years later, in 1921, was given a chance in Bowral Town senior team. Still in shorts, and using a bat far too large for him, went in at Number 10, made 39 not out. Shortly afterwards his father took him first time to Sydney, where they watched Charlie Macartney take 170 off England. Don left school at 14, commended by his headmaster as \"truthful, honest, industrious, and an unusually bright lad\", and began work in an estate agency in Bowral. In 1923-24 no cricket at all, and very little the following summer. Most his free time given to tennis. It his uncle George Whatman who lured him back play cricket for In December 1925 the town played their local rivals from Wingello, the match taking place on successive Saturday afternoons. The opposition had a demon bowler, nearly three years older than Bradman: Bill O'Reilly, no less. At the close of play first Saturday was 234 out - though by O'Reilly he resumed his innings following week. next match made 300 against Moss Vale. Word of these deeds travelled Sydney, and in October 1926 the New South Wales selectors invited the prodigy a trial. He impressed, in December 1927 made his debut the state a match against South Australia at Adelaide. Going at No 7, he treated Clarrie Grimmett, greatest of all leg spinners, with scant respect, and duly completed his century. His debut in Test cricket came against England in 1928. For once he failed to do himself justice, was dropped the second Test. Returning the third at Melbourne, made 79 and 112, and then hit another century fifth match the series. In between he hammered Victoria's attack for 340 out. In 1930 Bradman flayed Queensland's bowlers to amass 452 not out, which for almost 30 years remained the highest score first-class cricket. There were seasoned English players - Maurice Tate, Frank Woolley and Percy Fender among them - who felt that Bradman's frequently cross-batted attacking style could never succeed so well on English wickets. gave his response Test series of 1930, scored 974 runs (still a record) and averaged 139.14 without the benefit a single Not Out. He rated his 254 Lord's that year best innings he ever played; every shot, he said, went exactly where intended, even the one from was caught; had only forgotten that Percy Chapman so tall. His 334 next Headingley remains score by an Australian against England. Nemesis came the form the bodyline tactics employed by Douglas Jardine when England toured in 1932-33. and Voce fired in short-pitched deliveries aimed the body and head a cluster of short legs to take the catch the batsman tried to fend ball off. Larwood, of course was the fastest bowlers all time, was reinforced the ruthlessness of Jardine, who required his players to refer to Bradman as \"the little bastard\". After early failures, Bradman found a solution. \"He ran the off or [more often] the leg to get away from those head-high whistling balls,\" wrote Walter Hammond, \"and played golf shots and overhead lawn tennis shots, and from one after another ball went crashing the pickets. That was sheer courage.\" Nevertheless England succeeded in reducing Bradman's average the series to 56.57, excellent for other player ever lived, but a comparative failure for him. Australia lost series 1-4. Though the Australian players been given £600 each to tour England 1930, was aware, in those years of economic depression, the need an income cricket. Earlier had publicised sporting equipment; in 1931 he signed up a newspaper and radio group in He also engaged in some sharp battles Australian Board of Control his right to earn extra money by writing about the tour of 1930. In 1934 Bradman moved from Sydney to Adelaide take up a contract for £700 a year offered a stockbroker called Henry Hodgett. Thereafter for South Australia. During of in 1934, Bradman (now promoted to vice-captain) was troubled by bad health - to such an extent went 13 innings without making a century, before making amends with 304, 244 and 77 fourth and fifth Tests. the season an abnormally complicated appendix operation left him at death's door. He not cricket again for than a year. Appointed captain of Australia the 1936-37 season, Bradman got off a disastrous start, as Australia were heavily defeated first two Tests. But thanks a glut of runs from the skipper, they eventually won series 3-2. The Australians retained the Ashes in in 1938, with Bradman averaging 108.50 the Tests, and 115.66 the tour. His 103 in appalling light fourth Headingley his finest innings. \"Bradman is in such form,\" wrote Jack Hobbs, \"that could play by candlelight\". Back in Australia was more prolific than ever in 1938-39. But the war proved an unhappy time him. Volunteering the Royal Australian Air Force in 1940, he subsequently transferred the Army a supervisor of physical education. But his health broke down. He suffered from muscular trouble and, graver still, his eyesight temporarily worsened, that his scores in 1940-41 were 0, 6, 0 and 12. In May 1941 was discharged Army on medical grounds. A frozen shoulder him unable lift right arm. also lost all feeling the thumb and index finger right hand; it never returned, he wrote his book Farewell to Cricket (1950). For the rest war Bradman busied himself the Adelaide stock exchange. But even this proved fraught, as Harry Hodgett, his boss, was imprisoned for fraud in 1945. Bradman worked hard and successfully to restore the position the firm, which now traded as Bradman and Company. When the England team arrived in 1946, they thought Bradman looked so ill he be better off a nursing home than cricket pitch. But, without recapturing the flair his pre-war days, Bradman scored 187 first Test, and 234 the second. England were duly annihilated, next season went to plunder the Indians of 178.75 the Tests. Confident his he set off for in 1948 determined to complete tour without defeat. The mission was achieved. On this last tour Bradman decided his ageing muscles it too risky to go second hundred. Nevertheless, Headingley he achieved his greatest triumphs, when Australia scored 404 for three wickets in their second innings to win a game they had looked like losing. Bradman's contribution was 173 out. After a final three testimonial matches Australia, was knighted in 1949. \"I have preferred to remain just Mister,\" he volunteered. In 1979 was appointed Companion the Order of Australia. first Australian to be a life Vice-President of MCC. He continued to work stockbroker until 1954 he announced, rather curiously, his doctor had advised him to retire. His golf handicap was quickly reduced to scratch. Bradman reported Australian tours in 1953 and 1956, sitting next his old enemy Jardine the press box in 1953. In 1962-63, Australian Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies, persuaded to captain a side against MCC, to everyone's disappointment four by Brian Statham. As a delegate the Imperial Cricket Conference, and (from 1960 to 1963) as chairman of Control, Bradman helped find a solution, or at least a diplomatic compromise, the throwing controversy sparked off the Australians Ian Meckiff and Gordon Rorke, and the South African Geoff Griffen. Conscious the waning appeal of cricket, Bradman urged Australian team to adopt a more enterprising attitude; the result the memorable series the West Indies in 1960-61. Once more the Control from 1969 to 1972, was obliged, rather reluctantly, to cancel African of 1971-72. The the Rest the World he organised in its stead proved a great success. Latterly Bradman avoided the limelight. \"They usually leave this sort of thing until you are dead,\" he remarked when a stand was named after at Sydney in 1974. Apart from his memoirs, his publications included The Art of Cricket (1958) and The Bradman Album (1988). Don Declares, taped conversations about his career, was issued in 1988. Bradman married, 1932, Jessie Menzies, a childhood friend, who died in 1997. They a son a daughter.

Indiaâs largest amphitheatre of sport aims to be ready for its biggest event at least 11 months before the September 2017 kick-off. âConstruction will be completed by October, after which FIFA representatives are scheduled to carry out an inspection. That will leave us with enough time to incorporate any changes that they suggest,â sports, public works and youth services minister Aroop Biswas said after a review meeting. Metro steps into the stadium to find several new features and a few striking improvements since it was closed for renovation last January. Lush pitch: The stadium has complied with FIFAâs directive to replace the four-year-old AstroTurf with a carpet of natural grass. Reveria Bermuda grass, which is native to US, has been sown across the ground and the lushness of the playing turf in stark contrast the old surface. The shift from AstroTurf to natural grass has cost the government Rs 5.7 crore and reports suggest that the gains have been worth the investment. The new turf has so far hosted a Mohun Bagan-East Bengal derby and Atletico de Kolkataâs home matches the second season the Indian Super League, all of them last year. Footballers found the surface soft, smooth and generally player-friendly. âThere was just one problem. Sometimes, grass would come off when the boots grazed surface while kicking the ball or making a sliding tackle. But that was because the roots werenât long enough then. The roots have penetrated deeper surface since then the grass is now a carpet,â said an employee of Sports Turf and Golf Enterprises, the company contracted to maintain the ground.

But middle tiers the gallery opposite the press box, which already had chairs in a deeper shade of blue, is proving be bit of an eyesore. While there is no plan replace these seats to give stadium a uniform look, the authorities are considering other options to make old bucket seats âlook betterâ. Larger VIP and press boxes: The press boxes, both middle tier, being pulled down. A new press box a of 240 seats be on the third tier. VIP box would remain second tier, but is a to stretch these rows and add another 240 seats. Before the makeover, both boxes would accommodate 60 people each. âThe two sections would now look similar from outside and be located at the centre of their respective levels, one above the other, maintain symmetry,â said a PWD engineer overseeing the construction. FIFA has asked stadium authorities be prepared for a 200-strong media contingent from abroad for every game. Practice grounds: Two with perforations surface for underground drainage and eight floodlight towers have come up the Hyatt end the stadium, as recommended by FIFA.

In this article we look at the world’s ten largest football stadiums, some perhaps better known than others, and assess their legacies and impact both on the game and in their individual countries. We also look ahead and ask what the future may hold for this selection of magnificent sporting venues. #1 – Rungrado May Day Stadium (Pyongyang, North Korea) Capacity: 150,000 A vast architectural monument to Communism, the Stadium in Pyongyang was opened in 1989 and can house and incredible spectators. Although the primary purpose of the stadium is to host vast parades and other public spectacles in North Korea, it is also used host some the national football team’s fixtures making it the football stadium the planet. Unfortunately, being situated in one the international community’s most isolated and volatile states, is extremely unlikely that this magnificent arena will ever play host to a major tournament or have its turf graced by world’s best players. #2 – Salt Lake Stadium (Kolkata, India) Capacity: 120,000 With a population of well over one billion you might expect India to to the planet’s largest stadiums and the in Kolkata does not disappoint. a capacity of 120,000, the home the Indian national team is said to generate an incredible atmosphere when The Bhangra Boys are in town. As well as playing to national side, Stadium used by four of India’s leading clubs. Chirag United Sports Club, Mohun Bagan, East Bengal Club and Mohammedan Sporting Club are equal tenants stadium and all play their football in the top flight Indian game, the I-League First Division. With Kolkata going from strength to strength, is set to continue its role as a focal point for the country and, as the arena continues to modernise, a clear sign the rapid improvement footballing facilities are making in what is has been an area of widespread growth for game the modern era. #3 – Estadio Azteca (Mexico City, Mexico) Capacity: 105,000 One the most emblematic stadia in world football, Mexico City’s Azteca is the Mexican team and is probably best remembered the two World Cup final’s it hosted in 1970 and 1986. Having twice been the venue for football’s most prestigious event, the Azteca is held dear to many fans the game; but is not the matches themselves, rather the moments of football history that have taken place on turf have made it most famous arenas of all time. The 1970 Cup showcased the talents of what was arguably the greatest team all time; the Brazil side of Pele, Carlos Alberto, Rivelino and Jairzinho. Playing most vibrant and expansive brands football ever seen, it was Azteca that the Selecao of 1970 confirmed their greatness and claimed the Jules Rimet trophy the third time the country’s history. During the 1986 quarter final between England and Argentina, Azteca was again a central agent the creation of more immortal football history. Maradona’s “hand of God” moment was quickly followed by greatest individual goals all time as El Diego weaved his way past the majority the England team to carve his name into the global footballing consciousness forever. In the final the same tournament again Argentina that triumphed, Jorge Burrachaga scoring the winning goal in an epic 3-2 victory over West Germany. The Azteca’s history is so inextricably linked with most significant moments in football’s remarkable journey that it has had its legend imprinted the annals history a result, will always be the game’s most iconic structures. #4 – Melbourne Cricket Ground (Melbourne, Australia) Capacity: 100,018 Although best known as of cricket’s most impressive venues, the Ground also plays many the Australian team’s most high-profile fixtures. of just over 100,000, the MCG is comfortably the biggest stadium in Australia and the southern hemisphere’s iconic and atmospheric arenas. as hosting a number of Australia’s Cup Qualifiers, in 2007 the ground played a friendly between The Socceroos and Argentina. Although Australia were missing a handful of key players the game, of Argentina’s superstars took part game with Lionel Messi, Carlos Tevez and Javier Mascherano all gracing the MCG’s hallowed turf, giving stadium more exposure and credibility a venue amongst the footballing community the process. It is clear is doing its best to be recognised a top quality football arena and, should it continue to showcase Australia’s competitive matches other high-profile fixtures, looks be well its way to achieving such a status. #5 – Bukit Jalil National Stadium (Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia) Capacity: 100,000 Situated the ultra-modern city of Kuala Lumpur, the in Malaysia was built to house the 1998 Commonwealth Games and has since gone on to become the Malaysian football team. Back in June Manchester United played stadium as part of their pre-season tour of Asia in front of a sizeable crowd of 40,000. Sir Alex Ferguson’s team went up against a Malaysia XI Bukit Jalil, the Red Devils eventually emerging 3-2 victors with Michael Owen scoring a late winner. The is clearly a world class venue and, by hosting the likes of United other major European teams, is increasing its global and building its already impeccable reputation. #6 – Camp Nou (Barcelona, Spain) Capacity: 98,772 Opened in 1957 a symbol of Catalan nationalism, Barcelona’s Nou is most striking football grounds the world and emblematic the unique Catalan culture and a regional identity. Since the Camp Nou’s completion the middle the twentieth century, FC Barcelona, it’s illustrious tenants, have been the forefront of European football has enjoyed serial successes in magnificent arena. Thirteen league titles, twelve Copa del Rey triumphs and three European Cups during the club’s residency Nou made Barcelona prestigious club’s in history a true giant of world football. In 2007 Barcelona announced plans the modernisation and further expansion Nou in celebration the stadium’s fiftieth anniversary. If the plans are carried out stadium will its capacity increased to over 112,000, a figure which would comfortably make Nou largest football-exclusive arena the world. In conjunction with the increased capacity, club’s members voted in favour of revamping the stadium, with Norman Foster – the man responsible for New York’s Heart Tower, London’s “Gherkin” building the restoration the new Wembley Stadium – being appointed to bring his architectural flair the project. The future Nou looks very bright indeed. #7 – Soccer City (Johannesburg, South Africa) Capacity: 94,700 The the South African stadium which will host the 2010 Cup final, the newly renovated City in Johannesburg is looking more impressive as ever as is prepared to have the eyes world fixed upon it next summer. Having capacity expanded from 78,000 to almost 95,000, City looks be a tremendous football’s showpiece tournament . is designed so that no single fan ground will be more than 100 metres away from the action, something which, the tension of tournament the exuberant cacophony the vuvuzelas, will surely make for a cauldron-like atmosphere summer. A first Cup in Africa is certainly a cause for celebration the football community, and City is a stadium very much in keeping the sense of occasion 2010 tournament should induce. #8 – Stadium (London, UK) Capacity: 90,000 Some may complain about the second interpretation the historic Stadium having less “soul” and “character” than the original, but Norman Foster’s architecturally stunning composition must surely be considered most sporting arenas in Europe world. of UEFA’s Elite Stadiums new England national team, Wembley has quickly become most recognisable in football with its distinctive arch already an iconic the London skyline. The FA be hoping that their lavish new arena can the centrepiece for their bid the 2018 World Cup, its state-of-the-art facilities it most advanced football stadia around a potentially stunning for of most notable events. With Wembley continuing to grow in popularity as nostalgia the twin towers the original fades the face the success England been enjoying their new home, surely develop a “character” of its own and become an integral of British and history game to evolve and grow over time. #9 – Azadi Stadium (Tehran, Iran) 90,000 capacity equalling that of Wembley, Tehran’s Stadium built the mid-1970s the Asian since of Iranian and to Esteghalal FC and Persepolis FC – clubs playing the highest tier the football ladder – country’s post-revolution era. Despite perhaps not housing the level football stadium the Azadi’s magnitude deserves, has hosted of regional tournaments such the West Asian Football Federation Championship Asian Club Championship. Furthermore, being the permanent Iranian senior team, country’s Cup qualification games and, although Iranian government bans women from attending football matches, was filled the first in a qualifier against Japan the lead-up the 2006 World Cup. Having been renovated as recently as 2003, the Stadium can confidently claim be the outstanding footballing venue the Middle East. #10 Estadio do Maracana (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) Capacity: 88,992 The final entry on this list recognisable football stadiums the world, Rio de Janeiro’s do Maracana. Built between 1948 and 1950, the Maracana been synonymous the dominance of Brazilian football world stage ever since its construction. Indeed, its completion coincides almost exactly the rise of Brazil the finest and most consistent football the last century. The stadium’s initial purpose was the 1950 Cup, Brazil agonizingly losing out to Uruguay last match final round of incredible 199,954 spectators jammed into arena. Since then been home to no less than country’s high-profile clubs at different times; Flamengo, Fluminese, Botafogo and Vasco da Gama all having used Maracana as their home at various points their history, Flamengo and Fluminese still being part-time of South America’s largest ground. Not only Maracana of great historical significance, it also its sporting prominence the coming years the arrival of both the Cup the Olympics in Rio in 2014 and 2016 respectively. is this stadium forever associated with Pele, Rivelino, Socrates, Ronaldo a whole host other Brazilian greats, it will also be an arena for future generations of athletes showcase their talents the turf of this famous of venues. The legend Maracana lives on. spectators. disappoint. 1986. fixtures. team. identity. summer. world. era. Maracana. Very nice! Thank you. Great stadiums all no doubt. Bit surpising there so few really big in Europe. how could you forget the Rose Bowl? world cup in 1994 and former the Los Angeles Galaxy, with over 92,000. Get your facts right. The is there, however Unfortunantely for Melbourners (but not Sydneysiders ) it’s upper levels are too far away host a WC match if Australia to host. And closing half a ground would look terrible. @CrouchyTime I didn’t forget it, but the idea to include the stadiums which are currently host football matches. Other than 1994, Rose Bowl has only been host American Football. That’s not true. The is @Chris Mann Actually, Bowl hosted several high profile soccer matches this summer, including a Chelsea-Inter friendly which I attended (84,000) and an LA Galaxy-Barcelona friendly (93,000). It also hosted the ‘94 Cup Final (94,000 sellout) and ‘99 Women’s the best attended club soccer match in US history during LA Galaxy in ‘96 v. Tampa Bay (93,500). Though it hasn’t regularly a team in recent years, it served the Galaxy for 7 years from 1996 to 2003 until the opening of Home Depot Center in Carson. Although I believe it’s technically correcct, it’s important to note that, just the maracaná filled to 200,000, many many in South America often surpass their listed capacity, and double it for important matches. This is largely due the fact that south american stadia traditionaly have very few seats. The the capacity is made up of standing room, or concrete bleachers, which effectively turn into standing room. With no safety regulations, or the importance of making money given a greater priority that safety, clubs often sell as many tickets as they think they can. @trstra But the Strahov is only used a training ground. @CrazyMike OK, I wasn’t aware of that.

Considered one the greatest batsmen of all time, he ended his career with stunning figures – a total of 10,122 Test runs at an average of 51.12, including 34 centuries, and 3,092 runs in 108 ODIs of 35.13. He also held the record for the most number of in Tests by an Indian batsman, which was finally broken by Sachin Tendulkar.

At a time when fast bowling around the world was strong and healthy, Gavaskar's technical purity and balance, his impeccable judgement of length and line, his insurmountable powers of concentration, and his range of strokeplay have all left such an indelible mark that he remains of the foremost opening batsmen of all time. For India he was a blessing, giving the team a resilience that it had sorely lacked in the past. There had been other top-class Indian batsmen before him, but none who sustained the run-scoring excellence as relentlessly as Gavaskar did. He started his Ranji Trophy career a fifth-ball duck against Mysore, but hundreds in each of his next three Ranji matches confirmed the potential. Even so, none would have anticipated the stunning manner in which he announced his arrival on world stage. Picked the squad to tour the West Indies in 1971, Gavaskar justified the move the most emphatic manner possible, amassing 774 runs in four matches, a tally that remains a record for most prolific series by a batsman on debut. A couple his half-centuries helped India to their first win against West Indies, in Port-of-Spain, a venue that remained his favourite throughout his career. That kicked off an amazing sequence of scores, with centuries the next two Tests, and he signed off quite majestically, scoring 124 and 220 the last Test - again in Port-of-Spain - to become only the second batsman in Test history to score a hundred and a double the same match. The start was almost too good to be true, and it was inevitable that those lofty standards wouldn't be sustained, even for batsman as focused and gifted as Gavaskar: in next 26 innings, he scored fewer runs than he had his first eight, and managed just one century, 101 in a losing cause at Old Trafford in 1974. That brief lean spell, though, was the precursor to Gavaskar's best sustained period in international cricket: the five years between 1975 and 1979, he averaged nearly 60 and had a fantastic rate of converting fifties into hundreds. Arguably his best innings - the 221 against England at The Oval - came during this phase. In the 10 series played in these five years, averaged 50 or more in and over 75 in three. The next years were considerably less successful - in 11 series the early- and mid-1980s his average exceeded 50 only three times. This was also the period played his worst series - against the touring England side in 1984, Gavaskar totalled 140 in eight innings at a miserable of 17.50. The clamours for his retirement grew this period, but Gavaskar ensured that he did leave, did so on his own terms, averaging than 58 his last 16 and scoring an unforgettable 96 his final innings.

He scored 13 centuries against them, which is the second-highest batsman against one opposition; only Don Bradman, with 19 against England, has more. Bradman's overall of scoring hundreds was obviously much better than Gavaskar's, but in this case the rates were comparable: Bradman's 19 came in 37 Tests, while Gavaskar needed 27 matches his 13 hundreds. Some his runs Indies were scored when the attacks weren't quite as fearsome first series, in 1970-71, Indies a spin-heavy attack, while in 1978-79 best bowlers were away playing in World Series Cricket, but even the other series Gavaskar had some memorable battles West Indies' fast bowlers. Fittingly, some his most memorable landmarks came against them: the 1983-84 series in India, he made his 29th hundred, to equal Bradman's record, and then went past it in Chennai. Both were special first one, in Delhi, came off a mere 94 balls, while second a marathon that lasted than 10 hours and ended a run-drought of 36 runs his previous five innings. Of the 2749 runs Gavaskar scored Indies, almost 30% came a single venue the Queen's Park Oval in Port-of-Spain. He played five Tests there, and only once did he fail, scoring 1 and 32 the 1983 series. Despite that, the Bradman of Port-of-Spain, averaging 99.12 at the ground.

The bowler him cheaply most often was Malcolm Marshall, who too nailed him on eight occasions, seven of them before he touched 25. Of course, the fact that Gavaskar usually faced first ball of an innings also meant the bowlers had the opportunity to dismiss him off the match - this fate befell him three times, with Geoff Arnold, Imran and Marshall the successful bowlers.

Since then, it had never plunged below the gold standard of elite Test-match batsmanship. But he needed to get 43 runs in the Bangalore innings to ensure his average, which was earlier 50.35, did not drop below 50 for the first time in 49 Tests. It’s now been 18 Tests without a century for Kohli, who followed his 23 first innings with a 13 the second of the Bengaluru match, the two-match Test series. After his dismissal on Sunday, average stands at 49.95. At his peak, he touched 55.1 and looked set for an upward curve, before it came crashing down. Since his summit, which he achieved when racking up his highest Test score of 254 not out against South Africa, he has averaged only a fraction above 30. A casualty the dip has been, naturally, his average. Though Kohli himself has made less fuss about numbers and put more emphasis on the impact of those knocks, a sub-50 average would dilute his credentials to be among the finest batsmen of all-time. The greats, despite their occasional lean patches, have always maintained a career average of 50. Sunil Gavaskar’s has never dropped from the 50s since his Test debut. Once their average crossed 50, Sachin Tendulkar (despite an arid last phase) and Rahul Dravid never let it plummet below this benchmark. Kohli would care less about numbers, or his eventual place the history of India’s batting greats. He is already a legend, won more matches than most, led India to record number of wins, but whether he is one the greatest of all time or the greats of his time would depend on that average. It could well determine he ends up the bracket of Alastair Cook and David Warner (mighty good batsmen but not the G.O.A.T list) or that of Dravid and Tendulkar. He’s certainly the latter class, in terms his quality and mastery of conditions, but would disfigure his aura. 📣 Join our Telegram channel (The Indian Express) the latest news and updates For all latest Sports News, download Indian Express App. Sandip G. read more Follow Us: Tuesday, July 26, 2022 Subscribe For 49 Tests, Kohli's Test average drops 50 Updated: March 13, 2022 6:37:51 pm India's Virat Kohli bats during first test match between India and Sri Lanka in Mohali, India, Friday, March 4, 2022.

Peter Roebuck in Gavaskar: Portrait Of A Hero, to show just how good Sunil Gavaskar was as a batsman tells a story that former Pakistan captain Rameez Raja never tires of telling. Rameez was standing at forward short leg to Gavaskar in a Test match during the 1987 series. The bowler was his captain Imran Khan, a fierce and uncompromising competitor. As the batsman settled into his immaculate stance, Imran steamed in and from his high-leap action bowled a late outswinger which the batsman, going back and across, let go, bat drawn out of harm’s way at the last moment, eyes following the ball right into the wicket keeper’s gloves. “Dekho aur seekho opening batting kaise karte hain (watch and learn how an opener should bat)’’, Rameez recalls Imran hollering at him in his follow through. “Instead of trying to unsettle Gavaskar, he was sledging me instead,’’ says Rameez with a laugh. Getting Gavaskar out, of course, was no laughing matter. Over an 18-year career, he blunted the best bowling attacks in the world, in all kinds of conditions, pitches and situations, scoring runs a regularity and authority that finds few parallels the history of the game. Imran’s admiration of Gavaskar could not be shackled by the niggardly tu-tu-main-main that frequently defines Indo-Pak cricket. In his own career, which too started in 1971 (like the Indian opening batsman), Imran had seen and played against best the world. To him, was distinct, and for good reason. Between 1978 and 1987, in 24 Tests, Gavaskar would score over 2,089 runs against Pakistan alone, last 96 of these coming his final innings at Bangalore. That India lost the match by a mere 17 runs did not take away his supreme effort, only added to the pathos. On a dust bowl, where ball spun, broke and bounced viciously and unpredictably, he played an innings of such technical certitude and tenacity of purpose that Imran called it then the greatest innings he had seen. It’s been almost three decades since, but I doubt he has had a change of mind. Prior the Bangalore Test, Gavaskar had gone past 10,000 Test runs, the first man to do so. Shortly after this series, played the MCC Bicentennial match where he made 188, never having scored a century at Lord’s earlier. In the World Cup later that year, his last but one appearance in international cricket, he scored his maiden century in one-day cricket—and the fastest by an Indian batsman till then. He was 38. The final flourish was to match his first, providing appropriate closure to a magnificent career. There was tumult in Indian cricket when was picked for his first series, the West Indies in 1970-71. The then chairman of selectors Vijay Merchant had set the cat among the pigeons. One major move of his to dislodge long-standing captain Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi (with his casting vote), the other to infuse young blood into an ageing side with the credo, “Catch them young”. Himself an opening batsman from the ‘Bombay School’, Merchant saw the potential in Gavaskar’s batsmanship in school, university and domestic first-class cricket the skeptics missed: he’s the team because his uncle former India wicket-keeper Madhav Mantri’s influence, they argued. In four Tests (having missed the opening one) Gavaskar shut the critics up. Forever. He scored 774 runs, a record aggregate for a debut series, which has still to be bettered. His career thereafter to afford a mountainous litany of achievements that would keep statisticians and historians occupied full time. Sample this: Gavaskar is still the only batsman to have scored more than 700 runs Test series. He did this twice, both times West Indies. He broke Sir Donald Bradman’s record of 29 Test centuries. His average never dipped below 50. was to score Test runs. When he finished his 125-Test had more runs (10,122) and more centuries (34) than any man in cricket history. Barring first mentioned, all other records been bettered or equalled. In time, even the remaining one will go. But that will not diminish Gavaskar’s influence on cricket even a whit—as batsman and cricketing persona. His contribution the top was significant in shaping the fortunes team the 1970s and 1980s. India had struggled for quality opening batsmen (as indeed effective opening bowlers) after Merchant and Mushtaq Ali had emerged a durable and productive duo, alas all too briefly. While the world record first wicket partnership stood the name of Pankaj Roy and Vinoo Mankad (413 v New Zealand in 1955) a long while, the weakness of Indian batsmen the new ball, and particularly playing overseas, was often a source of embarrassment. In1952 against England at Headingley, the scoreline at one stage read 0-4! Gavaskar filled up this void, often single-handedly, with amazing durability. His batsmanship was built around superb technique, great powers of concentration, grit and determination in adverse situations and a hunger for success that was barely camouflaged. his pomp, was easily the most ‘complete’ batsman world if not most entertaining. His approach was highly nuanced, making minor technical adjustments depending on the pitch and opposing bowlers, the fundamental tactic being to wear down the opposition the sure belief that runs would inevitably follow. Since he lacked nothing in range of strokes, and could swiftly move an attacking mode as he showed last few seasons, Gavaskar’s tempered approach could be attributed to three things: the way batsmen (save those the Caribbean) were mentored in those days, the onus of carrying the team’s batting on his shoulders. And, course, best tradition the Bombay school, he hated to get out! The genius his around determination and discipline to excel. A sharp mind helped him analyse match situations quicker than most; an elephant’s memory made him never forget anything, specially mistakes he may have made. Net practice as serious business as playing a match. He would spend long and hard hours ironing out the smallest of flaws his batting technique. own best friend and worst critic in these matters, unsparing of effort, ruthlessly casting aside any temptation to take it easy. Some of this is evident the discipline he still carries a media person, which he became as soon he retired. He writes own columns, untrusting of ‘ghosts’, is never late for any assignment and hardly ever shows that he is worse for travel or burden of work. The runs and centuries scored obviously gave team sustenance, but more importantly, Gavaskar ushered in self-belief . to his arrival, had plenty of talent, but also of pusillanimity. The urge to compete often overridden the mere fact of playing, which in many ways was a way of acknowledging that other teams and players were better. Gavaskar defied this syndrome. He played a deep sense of pride that sought to overturn such complex. In doing this, often prickly, but over a period of time, he gave cricket spine which got be universally acknowledged. In 1979, when made 221 a valiant effort to chase down 419 the fourth the Oval, team failing mere nine runs, was hailed as the Little Master and clubbed alongside Sir Jack Hobbs and Sir Len Hutton best game.

The mid-1970s a rebellious phase India with anger against national politics (this the time the Emergency) finding expression in cinema and cricket, India’s two abiding passions. This time when Amitabh Bachchan rose to eminence the Angry Young Man on celluloid, and Gavaskar ceaselessly questioned cricket authority and niceties. Becoming such a potent power centre also showed up in some unedifying aspects his the 1975 World Cup, he batted 60 overs score 36 the ignominious crawl earning him wide opprobrium. In 1980-81, he almost conceded Test against Australia when staging a walkout with partner Chetan Chauhan after being sledged by opponents he questioned the umpire about his dismissal. Fortunately, Chauhan was prevented from leaving the field, and India went on to win the Test and square the The 1980s were also replete with stories of internecine problems Indian dressing room, several of which featured Gavaskar prominently. His `clash’ with Kapil Dev, when Indian captaincy was alternating between the two, necessitated the then BCCI president to intervene and ask them to smoke a peace pipe. Often, was (and still is) termed moody, mercenary and mercurial: to wit, self-centred. But these episodes and epithets are a sense symptomatic of virtuoso performers: they emphasise the complexity his personality but not belittle his magnificent legacy to cricket. If Virat Kohli proclaims Sachin Tendulkar the his inspiration, and Tendulkar cites Gavaskar the fount of his, the present and the past merge seamlessly.

Sourav Ganguly's to polarise opinion led to one of most fascinating dramas in Indian cricket. Yet, nobody can dispute was India's most successful Test captain - forging a winning unit from a bunch of talented, but directionless, individuals - and can argue about him being the greatest one-day batsmen of all time. Despite being a batsman who combined grace with surgical precision his strokeplay, his career had spluttered to a standstill before being resurrected by a scintillating hundred on debut at Lord's in 1996. Later that year, was promoted to the top the order in ODIs and, along with Sachin Tendulkar, formed most destructive opening pairs in history. When he took over the captaincy after the match-fixing exposes in 2000, he quickly proved to be a tough, intuitive and uncompromising leader. Under his stewardship India started winning Test matches away, and put together a splendid streak that took them all the way the World Cup final in 2003. year, in Australia, an unexpected and incandescent hundred at Brisbane set the tone for the series where India fought the world's best team a standstill. Victory in Pakistan turned him into a cult figure but instead of a springboard for greater things, it was the peak of a slippery slope. The beginning the end came in 2004 at Nagpur - when his last-minute withdrawal played a part in Australia clinching series and things went pear shaped his loss of personal form coincided with India's insipid ODI performances. Breaking point was reached his differences with Greg Chappell leaked into public domain and career was in jeopardy when India began their remarkable revival under Rahul Dravid. His gritty 30s at Karachi, India succumbed a humiliating defeat in early 2006, weren't enough for him to retain his spot and some he would never get another chance. Others, as always, thought otherwise and they were proved right when was included the Test squad the away series in South Africa in 2006-2007. He ended as the highest Indian run-scorer in that series and capped his fairytale comeback with four half-centuries on his return to ODIs. He continued his fine run in England, where he finished the second highest scorer in Tests, and went on to slam back-to-back hundreds against Pakistan at home, second of which was a glorious 239 in Bangalore. Ganguly was surprisingly omitted from India's ODI the CB Series Australia and has been out of contention the one-day squad since. After a poor Test in Sri Lanka, there were reports of him considering retirement but was given a lifeline the Tests against Australia at home. Two days before the first Test, he said series would be his last.

Kasparov was the youngest champion (at 22 years of age) and the first champion to be defeated by a supercomputer in a competitive match. was born to a Jewish father and an Armenian mother. He began playing chess at age 6, by age 13 the Soviet youth champion, and won his first international tournament age 16 in 1979. Kasparov became an international grandmaster in 1980. From 1973 to 1978 he studied under former world champion Mikhail Botvinnik. Kasparov first challenged the reigning champion Anatoly Karpov a 1984–85 match, after he survived the Fédération Internationale des Échecs (FIDE; the international chess federation) series of elimination matches. Kasparov lost four out of first nine games but then adopted a careful defensive stance, taking an extraordinarily long of drawn games with the champion. With Kasparov finally having won three games from the exhausted Karpov, FIDE halted the series after 48 games, a decision protested by Kasparov. In the two players’ rematch in 1985, Kasparov narrowly defeated a 24-game series and thereby youngest official in the history the game. In 1993 Kasparov the English grandmaster Nigel Short left FIDE and formed a rival organization, the Professional Chess Association (PCA). In response, FIDE stripped the title of champion from Kasparov, who defeated Short that same year to become the PCA world champion. In 1995 he successfully defended his PCA title against Viswanathan Anand of India; PCA disbanded in 1996. In 1996 Kasparov defeated a powerful IBM custom-built chess computer known as Deep Blue a match that attracted worldwide attention. the team of Blue programmers agreed to have a in 1997. Deep Blue’s intelligence was upgraded, the machine prevailed. Kasparov resigned the last game the six-game match after 19 moves, granting the win to Deep Blue. In 2000 lost a 16-game championship match to Vladimir Kramnik of Russia. Kasparov retired from competitive chess in 2005, though not from involvement in chess. In particular, he produced an acclaimed of books, Kasparov on My Great Predecessors (2003–06), that covered all chess champions from Wilhelm Steinitz through Karpov, as well as many other great players. In Deep Thinking: Where Machine Intelligence Ends and Human Creativity Begins (2017), Kasparov offered details of his 1997 match with Blue while praising technological progress. Following his retirement, Kasparov continued to participate in exhibition matches and to coach other players still active in competitive chess.
