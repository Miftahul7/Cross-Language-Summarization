চিঠিপত্রের আকারে লিখিত। এই বর্ণনাকারীরা উপন্যাসের প্রধান চরিত্রও বটে। যে ঘটনাগুলি উপন্যাসের কোনো চরিত্রই সরাসরি প্রত্যক্ষ করেনি, সেগুলি স্টোকার বর্ণনা করেছেন সংবাদপত্র প্রতিবেদনের আকারে। কাহিনির শুরুতেই সদ্য পাস করা ইংরেজ আইনজীবী জোনাথান হার্কার প্রথমে ট্রেন ও পরে ঘোড়ার গাড়িতে চেপে ট্রানসিলভ্যানিয়া, বুকোভ্যানিও ও মলডাভিয়ার সীমান্তপ্রদেশে অবস্থিত কার্পাথিয়ান পর্বতমালায় কাউন্ট ড্রাকুলার নির্জন পোড়ো দুর্গের পথে যাত্রা করছেন। তার এই যাত্রার উদ্দেশ্য হার্কারের নিয়োগকর্তা ইংল্যান্ডের এক্সেটরের পিটার হকিনসের একটি রিয়্যাল এস্টেট চুক্তি বিষয়ে ড্রাকুলাকে আইনি সহায়তা প্রদান। প্রথমে ড্রাকুলার রাজকীয় চালচলনে বিমোহিত হলেও ক্রমে হার্কার বুঝতে পারেন যে তিনি আসলে এই দুর্গে বন্দী হয়ে পড়েছেন। ড্রাকুলার নৈশজীবনের বিভিন্ন বীভৎস দৃশ্যও তার নজরে আসে। ড্রাকুলা তাকে রাত্রে তার কক্ষের বাইরে যেতে নিষেধ করেছিলেন। তা সত্ত্বেও এক রাত্রে তিনি কক্ষের বাইরে বেরিয়ে তিন সুদর্শন স্ত্রী ভ্যাম্পায়ারের খপ্পরে পড়েন। এরা ছিল ড্রাকুলার বউ। শেষ মুহুর্তে কাউন্ট তাকে রক্ষা করেন। প্রয়োজনীয় আইনি সাহায্য ও ইংল্যান্ড ও লন্ডন সম্পর্কে সম্পূর্ণ জ্ঞানলাভ করার পূর্বে কাউন্ট তাকে হত্যা করতে চাইছিলেন না। তার পরিকল্পনা ছিল লন্ডনের লক্ষ মানুষের মধ্যে গিয়ে উপস্থিত হওয়া। হার্কার কোনো মতে প্রাণ হাতে করে দুর্গ থেকে পালিয়ে আসেন।\n\nএর কিছুকাল পরেই ডিমিটার নামে একটি রাশিয়ান জাহাজ ভারনা থেকে নোঙর তুলে ইংল্যান্ডের হুইটবির উদ্দেশ্যে রওনা হয়ে এক ভয়ানক ঝড়ের কবলে পড়ে। জাহাজের নাবিকেরা সকলেই নিখোঁজ হয়ে যায়। ধরে নেওয়া হয় যে তারা সকলেই মারা পড়েছে। কেবলমাত্র জাহাজের হালের সঙ্গে বাঁধা অবস্থায় ক্যাপ্টেনের মৃতদেহ পাওয়া যায়। ক্যাপ্টেনের নথি থেকে জানা যায় যে যাত্রাকালে জাহাজে কিছু অদ্ভুত ঘটনা ঘটেছিল। তারপর থেকেই জাহাজের মাঝিমাল্লারা একে একে নিখোঁজ হয়ে যেতে থাকে। মনে করা হতে থাকে জাহাজে কোনো অশুভ শক্তির আবির্ভাব ঘটেছে। জাহাজ থেকে একটি বিরাট কুকুরের আকৃতিবিশিষ্ট জানোয়ারকে লাফিয়ে সমুদ্রতীরে নেমে যেতেও দেখা গিয়েছিল। জাহাজের মালের তালিকায় ছিল ট্রানসিলভ্যানিয়া থেকে আসা রুপালি বালি ও \"মৌলড\" (\"mould\") বা গুঁড়ো মাটি।ইংরেজি mould কথাটির অপর অর্থ \"জীবদেহমিশ্রিত মাটি\" অথবা \"কবরের মাটি\"\n\nএরপরই ড্রাকুলা হার্কারের প্রণয়ী উইলহেমিনা \"মিনা\" মুরে ও তার বান্ধবী লুসি ওয়েস্টেনরার সন্ধান পান। একই দিনে লুসি ড. জন সিউয়ার্ড, কুয়েন্সি মরিস ও মাননীয় আর্থার হোমউডের কাছ থেকে বিবাহের প্রস্তাব পান। লুসি সিউয়ার্ড ও মরিসের প্রস্তাব প্রত্যাখ্যান করে হোমউডের প্রস্তাবটি গ্রহণ করেন। এতে অবশ্য কোনো বন্ধুবিচ্ছেদ ঘটে না। সকলের মধ্যেই বন্ধুত্বসম্পর্ক বজায় থাকে। ইতোমধ্যে ড্রাকুলা ও সিউয়ার্ডের রোগী রেনফিল্ডের সাক্ষাৎ ঘটে। রেনফিল্ড লোকটা ছিল পাগল। সে ছোটো থেকে বড়ো আকারের নানারকম পোকামাকড়, মাকড়সা, পাখি আর অন্যান্য জন্তু খেয়ে বেড়াতো তাদের \"জীবনীশক্তি\" শুষে নেওয়ার জন্য। রেনফিল্ড গতিবিধি অনুধাবনকারীর কাজ করে। সে ড্রাকুলার নৈকট্য অনুধাবন করে সেই অনুযায়ী সূত্র যোগাতো।\n\nহঠাৎ করে লুসি সন্দেহজনকভাবে শুকিয়ে যেতে শুরু করে। তার সকল পাণিপ্রার্থীরা চিন্তিত হয়ে পড়েন। সিউয়ার্ড আমস্টারডামে তার প্রবীণ শিক্ষক অধ্যাপক আব্রাহাম ভ্যান হেলসিংকে ডেকে আনান। ভ্যান হেলসিং দেখামাত্র লুসির এই অবস্থার কারণটি বুঝতে পারেন। কিন্তু তিনি কাউকে কিছু বলতে অস্বীকার করেন। কারণ তিনি জানতেন, ভ্যাম্পায়ারের কথা বললে তার প্রতি সিউয়ার্ডের যে আস্থা আছে তা নষ্ট হয়ে যাবে। ভ্যান হেলসিং বিভিন্ন রকম ভাবে ব্লাড ট্রান্সফিউসন করে তাকে সারাবার চেষ্টা করেন। কিন্তু তা ব্যর্থ হয়। সিউয়ার্ডকে একটি চিঠিতে লুসির উপর নজর রাখার নির্দেশ দিয়ে ভ্যান হেলসিং এক রাত্রিতে আমস্টারডামের উদ্দেশ্যে রওনা হন। চিঠিটি ভুল ঠিকানায় গিয়ে পড়ে। সেই রাতেই লুসি আর তার মা-কে একটি নেকড়ে আক্রমণ করে। দুর্বল হৃদয়ের মিসেস ওয়েস্টেনরা ভয়েই মারা যান এবং লুসিও তার অনতিবিলম্বে মারা যান। উল্লেখ্য, ওই নেকড়েটিকে লন্ডনের চিড়িয়াখানা থেকে ড্রাকুলাই ছেড়ে দিয়েছিলেন কিছু কাজ হাসিলের জন্য।\n\nলুসিকে কবর দেওয়া হয়। কিন্তু তারপরই সংবাদপত্রের প্রতিবেদন থেকে জানা যেতে থাকে যে রাতে একটি \"ব্লুফার লেডি\" (ছোটোদের বর্ণনা অনুযায়ী, অর্থাৎ \"সুন্দরী নারী\") ছোটো ছেলেমেয়েদের পিছু নিচ্ছে।Leonard Wolf (2004), The Essential Dracula, Chapter 13, Note 31. \"Bloofer lady\" is explained as baby-talk for \"beautiful lady.\" ভ্যান হেলসিং বুঝতে পারেন যে লুসি একটি ভ্যাম্পায়ারে পরিণত হয়েছে। তিনি সকল বৃত্তান্ত সিউয়ার্ড, লর্ড গডামিং ও মরিসের কাছে প্রকাশ করেন। তাদের সাহায্যে ভ্যান হেলসিং লুসিকে খুঁজে বার করেন এবং লুসির ভ্যাম্পায়ার সত্ত্বা ও আর্থারের মধ্যে একটি বিশ্রী বিবাদের পর তারা লুসির হৃদপিণ্ডে শূল বিদ্ধ করেন, তার মুণ্ডচ্ছেদ করেন ও মুখে গার্লিক ঢেলে দেন।\n\nপ্রায় একই সময় বুদাপেস্ট থেকে সুস্থ হয়ে ফিরে আসেন জোনাথান হার্কার। বুদাপেস্টেই মিনা তার সঙ্গে যোগ দেন ও দুর্গ থেকে পালিয়ে এসে তারা বিবাহ করেন। এরপর জোনাথান ও মিনা দলের সঙ্গে যোগ দেন এবং ড্রাকুলার সঙ্গে মোকাবিলার কথা ভাবতে থাকেন।\n\nড্রাকুলা যখন জানতে পারেন যে ভ্যান হেলসিং ও অন্যান্য তার বিরুদ্ধে ষড়যন্ত্র করছেন, তখন তিনি তাদের সঙ্গে দেখা করে এবং মিনাকে তিন বার দংশন করে প্রতিশোধ নেন। ড্রাকুলা মিনাকে তার রক্ত পান করান। এর পরে দুজনের মধ্যে একটি অতিলৌকিক বন্ধন সৃষ্টি হয়। এর ফলে ড্রাকুলা মিনাকে নিয়ন্ত্রণ করতে শুরু করেন। এর থেকে উদ্ধার পাওয়ার একমাত্র রাস্তা ছিল প্রথমেই ড্রাকুলাকে হত্যা করা। মিনার শিরায় ড্রাকুলার রক্ত বইতে শুরু করলে মিনা ড্রাকুলার নিয়ন্ত্রণাধীন হয়ে পড়ে। সজ্ঞান অবস্থা থেকে সে মাঝে মাঝেই অর্ধ-চৈতন্য অবস্থায় চলে যেতে থাকে, যে অবস্থায় তার সঙ্গে ড্রাকুলার টেলিপ্যাথিক যোগাযোগ স্থাপিত থাকে। কিন্তু এই সংযোগটি তারা ব্যবহার করতে থাকেন ড্রাকুলার গতিবিধি অনুধাবনের জন্য। ভ্যান হেলসিং মিনাকে সম্মোহন করে ড্রাকুলা কোথায় আছে তা জেনে নিতে থাকেন। কিন্তু ড্রাকুলার দুর্গের কাছাকাছি আসার পর থেকে এই সংযোগটি দুর্বল হয়ে যেতে থাকে।\n\nড্রাকুলা ট্রানসিলভ্যানিয়ায় তার দুর্গে ফিরে আসেন। ভ্যান হেলসিং-এর দল তার পিছু নেন। শেষে তারা সূর্যাস্তের পূর্বেই তার সন্ধান খুঁজে বের করে ছুরি দিয়ে তার গলা কেটে ও হৃদপিণ্ডে শূলবিদ্ধ করে তাকে ধ্বংস করেন। ড্রাকুলার দেহ মাটির গুঁড়োয় পরিণত হয়। মিনার উপর থেকে তার প্রভাব নষ্ট হয়ে যায় এবং মিনা মুক্ত হয়। শেষ যুদ্ধে জিপসিরা কুইন্সি মরিসকে ড্রাকুলাকে দুর্গে ফিরিয়ে আনার অভিযোগে ছুরি মেরে হত্যা করেন। অন্যরা জীবিত অবস্থায় ইংল্যান্ডে ফিরে আসেন।\n\nবইয়ের শেষে একটি নোটে জোনাথান ও মিনার বিবাহিত জীবন ও তাদের প্রথম পুত্রসন্তানের সম্পর্কে জানানো হয়। ছেলেটির নাম দলের সকল চার সদস্যের নামানুসারে রাখা হয়েছিল। কিন্তু তাকে তাদের আমেরিকান বন্ধু কুইন্সির নামানুসারে কুইন্সি বলেই ডাকা হত।", "references": []}, {"title": "Introduction", "content": "right|200px|thumb|ব্রাম স্টোকার ড্রাকুলা (ইংরেজি: Dracula) আইরিশ লেখক ব্রাম স্টোকার রচিত একটি উপন্যাস। ১৮৯৭ সালে প্রকাশিত এই

Penguin Classics.", "references": ["War and Peace by Leo Tolstoy, trans Anthony Briggs 1,392pp, Penguin Classics, £16.99 \"As for Tolstoy,\" James Joyce wrote to his brother, when Joyce was 23, \"I disagree with you altogether. Tolstoy is a magnificent writer. He is never dull, never stupid, never tired, never pedantic, never theatrical!\" What did Joyce mean by not being theatrical? \"Then suddenly the most fearful scream - it couldn't be hers, she couldn't have screamed like that - came from inside the room. Prince Andrey ran to the door. The screaming stopped and he heard a different sound, the wail of a baby. 'Why have they taken a baby in there?' Prince Andrey wondered for a split-second.\" That is the untheatrical, impure, confused, comic way of describing a man as he waits for his wife to give birth. Tolstoy's War and Peace, whose unparaphrasable plot covers Russia during the Napoleonic wars, is a 1,400-page exercise in - a treadmill of - irony; and it is gleefully experimental. With War and Peace, Tolstoy introduced two novelistic innovations, both based on his new principle of length, which was part of his constant principle of irony. The first is luxurious detail. There is suddenly space to record deft things such as: \"A doctor in a bloodstained apron came out of the tent, holding a cigar between the thumb and little finger of one of his bloodstained hands to keep the blood off it.\" There are bad jokes, an emperor in trendy narrow shoes, mispronounced place names, dresses that have to be mended just before someone goes out. The second innovation is the way he breaks into the narrative, introducing historical essays. Flaubert and Henry James disliked them, considering them irrelevant and un-novelistic. But they can be exhilarating too: like the details, these essays are ironic. They are exercises in deflation. Such fun with form, however, has not always been obvious from his English translations. In 1889, for example, a man called Huntington Smith (working from a French version) abridged the novel into two sections - one for stories, one for essays - retitled it \"The Physiology of War\", and explained that Tolstoy was significant because he \"had a message to deliver, a message worth hearing, and the world has shown itself ready to hear\". This depressing sentence can stand as an allegory of the things that can go wrong in translation. But things have more often gone right. There are excellent translations by Constance Garnett, Rosemary Edmonds and, my favourite, by Louise and Aylmer Maude, whose version was approved by Tolstoy. And now there is a new translation, by Anthony Briggs, which is accurate and clear; and, in general, faithful. But there are problems with fidelity. Everyone, after all, has different definitions. Tolstoy, says Briggs, in his note on the translation, is \"an easy read for a Russian (and comparatively easy to translate). Stylistic angularities, shocks and surprises are infrequent, and the dialogue in particular is individualised but always natural. It seems most important to ensure in any translation the same kind of smooth reading, and varied but realistic-sounding dialogue.\" I have three reasons for feeling that Tolstoy has been betrayed here. First, this idea that he is an easy read in Russian. Vladimir Nabokov would remind his students that \"simplicity is bunkum. No major writer is simple\", and go on to show how Tolstoy's style is made up of \"creative repetitions\" - \"he gropes, he stalls, he toys, he Tolstoys with words\". For instance, Russian allows a gap between an adjective and its noun, and Tolstoy loved to elongate that fact. So in the final chapter, when Natasha is in the middle of a happy ending, Tolstoy describes her (literally) like this: \"And a joyful, and at the same time pathetic, asking forgiveness for her joy, expression, settled on Natasha's face.\" This is not smooth Russian, but deliberate complication. In Briggs's translation, it reads: \"And Natasha's face had shone with happiness, though it also had a pathetic look as if to apologise for any happiness.\" It is not that English offers him many ways of imitating Tolstoy's weird syntax, but that is no reason then to make out that nothing has been lost. It is no reason not to try. \"Have you noticed Tolstoy's language?\" asked Chekhov. \"Enormous periods, sentences piled one on top of another. Don't think that it happens by chance or that it's a shortcoming. It's art, and it only comes after hard work.\" Secondly, this idea that a translation should be happily smooth. I agree with Milan Kundera: \"Partisans of 'flowing' translation often object to my translators: 'That's not the way to say it in German (in English, in Spanish, etc.)!' I reply: 'It's not the way to say it in Czech either!'\" And thirdly, there is the dialogue. The three great previous translators of War and Peace were all educated women. Briggs is impatient with them, on the grounds that their language could not be equal to the brute earthiness of the soldiers' dialogue on battlefields. But it is not obvious that Briggs is so earthy either. \"'You all right, Petrov?' inquired one. 'We gave it to 'em hot, men. That'll keep 'em quiet,' another said. 'Couldn't see nothing. They were hitting their own men! Couldn't see nothing for the dark, mates. Anything to drink?'\" How much better is this than dialogue which Briggs dislikes: \"I say, fellow-countrymen, will they set us down here or take us on to Moscow?\" No, this novel is spikier than it now looks. While Moscow collapses, Pierre Besukhov is trying to predict the future, using a weird key which combines numbers with the French alphabet. Napoleon adds up to 666. Besukhov then tries to find Napoleon's numerical equal. Having failed with the Emperor Alexander, and the Russian nation, Pierre thinks, naturally, of himself: he doesn't work either. Finally, after adding in his nationality in French - russe - and then misspelling it, Pierre gets it right: \"Dropping the e again (quite unjustifiably) Pierre got the answer he was after in the phrase l'russe Besuhof - exactly 666!\" L'russe. If you needed an emblem of the novel, an un-French word - thrussian - made up by a French-speaking member of the Russian aristocracy would be it. And yet, in this translation, the loopiness of Pierre's bad French is mildly lost, because Tolstoy's sporadic French ambience has been cut out. It provides, therefore, a stray, enforced moment of polyphony. It is a small stylistic moment, but everything in this novel is small. Because War and Peace is a great novel not because Tolstoy's characters worry about God and death and nations, but because they make up weird words. Its subject is not grandiose: it is chance. And the only way to show this is minutely. Tolstoy is the greatest miniaturist in the history of the novel. He is economical. This outlandish, wonderful novel - which survives all of its impossible, necessary translations, including this thorough but imperfect one - is a masterpiece of reduction, and has style. · Adam Thirlwell's novel Politics is published by Vintage.

In Briggs's translation, it reads: \"And Natasha's face had shone with happiness, though it also had a pathetic look as if to apologise for any happiness.\" It is not that English offers him many ways of imitating Tolstoy's weird syntax, but that is no reason then to make out that nothing has been lost. It is no reason not to try. \"Have you noticed Tolstoy's language?\" asked Chekhov. \"Enormous periods, sentences piled one on top of another. Don't think that it happens by chance or that it's a shortcoming. It's art, and it only comes after hard work.\"Secondly, this idea that a translation should be happily smooth. I agree with Milan Kundera: \"Partisans of 'flowing' translation often object to my translators: 'That's not the way to say it in German (in English, in Spanish, etc.)!' I reply: 'It's not the way to say it in Czech either!'\"And thirdly, there is the dialogue. The three great previous translators of War and Peace were all educated women. Briggs is impatient with them, on the grounds that their language could not be equal to the brute earthiness of the soldiers' dialogue on battlefields. But it is not obvious that Briggs is so earthy either. \"'You all right, Petrov?' inquired one. 'We gave it to 'em hot, men. That'll keep 'em quiet,' another said. 'Couldn't see nothing. They were hitting their own men! Couldn't see nothing for the dark, mates. Anything to drink?'\" How much better is this than dialogue which Briggs dislikes: \"I say, fellow-countrymen, will they set us down here or take us on to Moscow?\"No, this novel is spikier than it now looks. While Moscow collapses, Pierre Besukhov is trying to predict the future, using a weird key which combines numbers with the French alphabet. Napoleon adds up to 666. Besukhov then tries to find Napoleon's numerical equal. Having failed with the Emperor Alexander, and the Russian nation, Pierre thinks, naturally, of himself: he doesn't work either. Finally, after adding in his nationality in French - russe - and then misspelling it, Pierre gets it right: \"Dropping the e again (quite unjustifiably) Pierre got the answer he was after in the phrase l'russe Besuhof - exactly 666!\"L'russe. If you needed an emblem of the novel, an un-French word - thrussian - made up by a French-speaking member of the Russian aristocracy would be it. And yet, in this translation, the loopiness of Pierre's bad French is mildly lost, because Tolstoy's sporadic French ambience has been cut out. It provides, therefore, a stray, enforced moment of polyphony.It is a small stylistic moment, but everything in this novel is small. Because War and Peace is a great novel not because Tolstoy's characters worry about God and death and nations, but because they make up weird words. Its subject is not grandiose: it is chance. And the only way to show this is minutely. Tolstoy is the greatest miniaturist in the history of the novel. He is economical. This outlandish, wonderful novel - which survives all of its impossible, necessary translations, including this thorough but imperfect one - is a masterpiece of reduction, and has style.· Adam Thirlwell's novel Politics is published by Vintage.To order War and Peace for £15.99 with free UK p&p call Guardian book service on 0870 836 0875 or go to theguardian.com/bookshopTopicsBooksClassicsLeo TolstoyreviewsReuse this content Advertisement US editionUS editionUK editionAustralian editionInternational edition The Guardian - Back to home The Guardian: news website of the year Show More Show More Books Books Buy War and Peace at the Guardian bookshop Buy War and Peace at the Guardian bookshop Buy War and Peace at the Guardian bookshop Buy War and Peace at the Guardian bookshop Topics Most popular Books Back to top "]}]}

But it is not called Robinson Crusoe. It was written by a wise old Muslim from Andalusia and is the third most translated text from Arabic after the Koran and the Arabian Nights. It is called Hayy ibn Yaqzan or \"Alive, Son of Awake\", and it was a sensation among intellectuals in Daniel Defoe's day. As has happened before during times of tension between Islam and the west, it is again emerging from the shadows and that is a matter for celebration, whether in New York or Baghdad. The book's author, Ibn Tufayl, was vizier to the 12th-century Caliph Abu Yaqub, but his restless mind took him into speculative fields more often frequented by revolutionaries. In an age when faith was essentially compulsory, he stood for reason and the noble Hellenic tradition of putting everything to the test. His creation, Hayy - an onomatopoeic word with a lovely lift on the second \"y\" - is reason incarnate; in seven sequences of seven years, he puzzles out everything from astronomy to zoology. Charmingly, Tufayl has him baffled at not having horns like the island's gazelles, or struggling with his skirt of leaves, which keep withering and falling off. But all the time, the philosopher is in the background, saying \"Don't take it on trust. Think.\" Appropriately for a teacher, the vizier is known to history not for Hayy, but for a lesson in Marrakech with tremendous consequences for European thought. In the winter of 1169, he and the Caliph were joined by a fellow Andalusian, Ibn Rushd, for whom the two older men had a task; to Rushd's alarm, the Commander of the Faithful began asking him forbidden philosophical questions. Rushd stuttered aghast over whether the world was created in a single divine act or - potentially a capital offence to claim - complexities like eternal matter might have been involved. But the Caliph and Tufayl launched into the issue with gusto, moaning that they were too old to tackle such riddles of \"the Ancients\", Aristotle and Plato. So began the great work of Averroes (Rushd's westernised name), which led to Europe's first Renaissance as his commentaries on the Greeks, translated from Arabic, returned the philosophers' lost works to the west. He is Dante's \"Famed Commentator\" in the Divine Comedy and the only brown face in Raphael's School of Athens. But Tufayl? No. Three poems and the 70 pages of Hayy are all that survive of his work and that was not enough for Parnassus. He caused his own small medieval stir, especially among Jewish thinkers prominent in the great translation \"factory\" run in Toledo by Archbishop Raymond. The light that shone from Tufayl illuminates Maimonides' Guide of the Perplexed. But then it passed into obscurity, until an Oxford don went shopping in Aleppo in 1653. The souk must have loved Edward Pococke, professor of Arabic and a famously genial enthusiast for the Muslim world, who came home burdened with souvenirs. Planting a Syrian cedar cone at his Berkshire vicarage and a Syrian fig in Christchurch, he handed his son, also Edward and another Arabic scholar, an age-mottled folio of neat calligraphy. It was Hayy ibn Yaqzan. Now in the Bodleian, the manuscript was copied in Alexandria in 1303 by an unknown scribe, probably Jewish, as the script is annotated in Hebrew. Pococke Junior's translation was published in 1671 and there was an immediate stir. The Enlightenment was in full swing and the book, sub-titled \"The Self-Taught Philosopher\", addressed the notion of a tabula rasa, an innocent mind developing through its own powers, which was absorbing John Locke. Locke refers eagerly to a meeting in London to discuss \"this novelty\" and three English translations followed. Spinoza pressed successfully for a Dutch translation, Leibnitz enthused about the book, which went into German twice, and Pococke's agent wrote from Paris: \"I delivered a copy to the Sorbonne for which they were very thankful, being much delighted with it.\" Then came Defoe, for whom the story married marvellously with the memoir of Alexander Selkirk, the real-life Crusoe. From Robinson's early capture by Moors to the seldom-read sequel \"Robinson Crusoe's Vision of the Angelic World\", Tufayl's footprints mark the great classic. Hayy is a different character from Crusoe but in a way that adds to his story's potency today. If the book was ultimately a lexicon for Using Your Head, its attraction for the practical, restlessly innovative west might not be shared by the more contemplative east. But in its highest manifestation, Hayy's reason leads him to personal awareness of God (or what Tufayl calls, with a philosopher's precision, the Necessarily Existent Being.) This is its great appeal for readers in the Muslim world where - although eclipsed as regularly as in the west - it is a hallowed Sufi text. Tufayl's motives are lost to us; but there is no doubt about his commitment to reason even if - perhaps as a veil to hide behind from heretic-hunters - he accepts that it is not for everyone. When Hayy leaves his island with Absal, his equivalent of Friday, to proselytise to the wider world, his preaching is a fiasco. His incomprehension that anyone could chop off a man's hands for theft threatens social order. The two \"ineffectual angels\", as one translation nicely describes them, return to the island of gazelles and content themselves with personal salvation until \"life's one certainty came to them\". The book is also an undoubted rebuke to anyone who debates fundamental issues with excessive conviction that they are right. Hayy's island life endlessly teaches him tolerance; he uses only what he needs for survival. He harvests or kills at times of the year when species can reproduce. He lives and lets live. This philosophy chimes with a vital age-group today. In an online forum run by Stanford university, a young American recalls a bedtime story of a desert-island girl raised by dolphins to be tolerant and kind. Another writes: \"I guess Tufayl wants to show parallels among people even if they haven't been exposed to other cultures.\" A third, archetypally American, comments: \"Isn't that special?\" The same thread runs through the latest English version of Hayy, a long overdue adaptation of the story for children conceived as a National Curriculum course by the Ismaili Aga Khan Foundation.

সালের ৩০ অক্টোবর। তাঁর আদিনিবাস নীলফামারী জেলায় ডোমার উপজেলার খাটুরিয়া গ্রামে। রংপুর শহরের মুন্সিপাড়ায় ছিল তাঁর বাবার বাড়ি। বাবার নাম মোহাম্মদ আলী। তিনি পেশায় উকিল ছিলেন। শরীফ ইমামের দুই বোন, এক ভাই।

থেকে ১৯৪২ সালে প্রথম বিভাগে ম্যাট্রিক পাস করেন। তারপর রংপুর কারমাইকেল কলেজে বিজ্ঞান বিভাগে ভর্তি হন এবং কলেজে পড়ার সময় জাহানারা বেগমের সঙ্গে পরিচয় হয়। ১৯৮৮ সালের ডিসেম্বর মাসে নিপুণ ম্যাগাজিনের ১৫

ইমামের সঙ্গে বিবাহবন্ধনে আবদ্ধ হন। তাঁদের দুই পুত্রসন্তান শাফী ইমাম রুমী ও সাইফ ইমাম জামী। ১৯৫০ সালে শরীফ ইমাম ঢাকায় সিএন্ডবিতে ডিজাইন বিভাগে যোগদান করেছিলেন। পরে সরকারি চাকরি ছেড়ে দিয়ে দি

দেশপ্রেমিক মানুষ। ভাষা আন্দোলনের সময় যেদিন হরতাল পালিত হতো, সেদিন তিনি কোনো না কোনো অজুহাতে অফিসে যাওয়া বন্ধ করে হরতাল সমর্থন করতেন। ১৯৭১ সালে রুমী যুদ্ধে চলে গেলে ইমাম পরিবারের ভূমিকাও হয়ে পড়ে আরও সক্রিয়। শরীফ ইমাম ও তাঁর বন্ধু সাজেদুর রহমান খান টাকা সংগ্রহ করে অল্প অল্প করে মুক্তিযোদ্ধাদের জন্য পাঠাতেন। বিভিন্ন প্রয়োজনে মুক্তিযোদ্ধারা শরীফ ইমামের ‘কণিকা’ বাড়িতে আসা-যাওয়া করতেন। জুন মাসের শেষের দিকে দুই নম্বর সেক্টর কমান্ডার মেজর খালেদ মোশাররফের একটি চিঠি নিয়ে শাহাদাত চৌধুরী ও হাবিবুল আলম আসেন শরীফ ইমামের বাড়িতে। পাকিস্তানি হানাদার বাহিনীর চলাচল ব্যাহত করার উদ্দেশ্যে খালেদ মোশাররফ তাঁর কাছে বাংলাদেশের ব্রিজ ও কালভার্টের ব্যাপারে তথ্য চেয়ে পাঠান। শরীফ ইমাম ঘোর অমানিশার মধ্যেও দেশ স্বাধীন হওয়ার ব্যাপারে ছিলেন প্রচণ্ড আশাবাদী। তিনি এতটাই দেশপ্রেমিক ছিলেন যে স্বাধীনতার পর একটি যুদ্ধবিধ্বস্ত দেশের অর্থনৈতিক অবস্থা চিন্তা করে ব্রিজের ঠিক কোন কোন পয়েন্টে এক্সপ্লসিভ বেঁধে ওড়ালে ব্রিজ ভাঙবে অথচ কম ক্ষতি হবে অর্থাত্ দেশ স্বাধীন হওয়ার পর সহজে মেরামত করা যাবে, সেভাবে বিস্তারিত তথ্য দিতেন মুক্তিযোদ্ধাদের। ১৯৭১ সালের ২৯ আগস্ট রুমী ও পরিবারের অন্য সদস্যে সঙ্গে শরীফ ইমামকেও পাকিস্তানি হানাদার বাহিনী বাসা থেকে ধরে নিয়ে যায়। পরবর্তীকালে পাকিস্তানি হানাদার বাহিনী শরীফ ইমামকে অমানুষিক শারীরিক ও মানসিক নির্যাতন করে আহত অবস্থায় ছেড়ে দেয়। রুমীকে উদ্ধার করার জন্য শরীফ ইমামের বন্ধু বাকা ও ফকির সাহেব মার্সি পিটিশন করার কথা বললেও প্রখর আত্মসম্মানবোধসম্পন্ন শরীফ ইমাম তাতে রাজি হননি। পরিণতিতে হয়েছেন পুত্রহারা। স্তব্ধ ও পাষাণের মতো চেহরায় শরীফ ইমাম প্রাণপ্রিয় পুত্রের কথা চিন্তা করতে করতে এবং চরম অপমানের যন্ত্রণা সহ্য করে মুক্তিযুদ্ধের জন্য কাজ করে গিয়েছিলেন। তাঁর একরোখা মনোভাব পুঞ্জীভূত হয়ে উঠেছিল মুক্তিযোদ্ধাদের জন্য গোপনে সাহায্য প্রস্তুতির মধ্য দিয়ে। দিনে দিনে তাঁর জীবনীশক্তি ক্ষয় হয়ে যাচ্ছিল পাকিস্তানি আর্মির বন্দিশিবিরে তিন দিন তিন রাতের অমানুষিক নির্যাতনের জের ধরে। তাই যে স্বাধীনতা দেখার জন্য তিনি এত উদগ্রীব হয়ে অপেক্ষা করছিলেন, সেই স্বাধীনতা দেখে যেতে পারলেন না। স্বাধীনতার মাত্র তিন দিন আগে তাঁর হূত্স্পন্দন বন্ধ হয়ে গেল। এভাবেই এই নীরব কর্মী, যথার্থ মুক্তিযুদ্ধের সহযোগী, সবার আড়ালে নিঃশব্দে চলে গেলেন। আমরা তাঁদের কথা কখনোই ভুলতে পারি না। মন্তব্য প্রদানের জন্য সাইনইন করুন © সর্বস্বত্ব স্বত্বাধিকার সংরক্ষিত প্রথম আলো ১৯৯৮ - ২০১৪ সম্পাদক ও প্রকাশক: মতিউর রহমান সিএ ভবন, ১০০

Square at the centre of Dhaka in Bangladesh has been filled with hundreds of thousands of protesters. What has brought them out in such numbers is the conclusion of one of the first of the war crimes trials. An Islamist collaborator with Pakistani perpetrators of the 1971 genocide which accompanied the nation's independence, Abdul Quader Mollah, was found guilty of war crimes. However, he was given a life sentence rather than the death penalty that Bangladesh's laws permit. It is shocking to see young, well-intentioned people demanding the death penalty. What drives them is the knowledge that a change of government to a more Islamist-friendly party will mean that Mollah's life sentence is commuted to a couple of years. It might seem unusual that young people, for the most part, are so passionate about events that happened long before they were born. But the genocide inflicted by Pakistan on what was then East Pakistan between March and December 1971 was one of the worst of the century. If it is now little known in the west, it remains something no Bengali can forget. No one knows how many people were killed – probably between 300,000 and 3 million; hundreds of thousands of women were raped by Pakistani troops. Pakistan still denies all culpability: the current Bangladesh trials are only of collaborators. But another reason for the ongoing anger and passion about these events, and the determination to bring the perpetrators to justice, is a book published in 1986 in Bangladesh. Jahanara Imam published her diary of the period between March and December 1971 under the title Ekattorer Dinguli (\"Days of '71\"). It was an immediate bestseller in Bangladesh, and has continued to be read by everyone, sometimes under its English title, Of Blood and Fire (the translator was Mustafizur Rahman). Imam, despite suffering from terminal mouth cancer, fronted a major campaign to bring the war criminals to justice in 1992, and has gone on being a national symbol of justice and wisdom. Her photograph, blown up into a banner, presides over the Shabagh Square protests. Of Blood and Fire is an extraordinarily powerful and affecting book. Just as the Holocaust needed a Diary of Anne Frank that brought the numbing total of deaths down to an individual, human case, so the Bangladeshi massacres are brought down to the feelings of a mother for her son. Imam was a highly educated, professional Bengali woman. She had been a notably successful headteacher. In 1971, she and her family – her husband, Sharif, and her teenage sons, Rumi and Jami – were in no doubt that the Bengalis needed their own homeland. The Pakistanis were openly racist; they regarded with contempt and had often tried to suppress the rich Bengali culture; they had no intention of allowing the Bengalis' leader, Sheikh Mujib, to take up the position that was rightfully his after he won a national general election. Jahanara Imam was flying a black flag and the flag of the Bengali Home (\"Bangla Desh\") from her rooftop when the protests were met with an effective declaration of war. The diary's magic resides in its combination of issues of huge political importance with small domestic concerns. Kitty, their American lodger, has to go – no one trusts Americans any more. As curfews are imposed, and more and more young firebrands start turning up at their house to argue deep into the night, Jahanara worries about where to get food to feed them. Can she trust the domestic servants? When neighbours pop in and ask to use their phone, how can she hide the young freedom fighter who is taking refuge with her? (She moves a cupboard to form a screen, is dissatisfied with the ugly appearance of its back, manages to buy some attractive fabric to cover it. It is quite a little saga.) The violent events happen just out of view. The chattering visitors – Bengalis always say they love to talk, and now they have something to talk about – bring news of successful assaults. They talk about how lucky it is that Bengal is having one of the heaviest monsoons in memory – the freedom fighters are used to floods, but the Pakistanis come from a dry country, and will struggle. And then Rumi, Jahanara's son, goes off to do his duty. Rumi is Jahanara's great love, but she bites back what she wants to say. She knows he has to go, even though she knows that he is slightly absurd, full of the passions of an 18-year old, and is running a terrible risk. He returns, bearded and exhausted. Delighted, she wants to photograph him before he goes to be shaved, but he is embarrassed at his appearance, and won't let her. And he wants to be so grown-up. He and his friends carry out a successful assault on the Pakistanis, shooting and killing soldiers from the back window of a black Morris Oxford and then giving the pursuers the slip. The whole street of Dhanmondi gentry celebrates. But then there is a knock on the door. It is the oppressors, led by a Captain Quayyum, \"looking like a student, pale, slim and with a soft voice\". Her husband and sons are taken away. Two return, with harrowing tales of torture. Rumi never does. We never learn his fate. We can well imagine the worst, as Jahanara does. There is a dreadful near-comedy of Rumi's absence, as Jahanara, in desperation, consults a religious wise man, Pagla Pir. He has nothing to say except that Rumi, he divines, is alive and well. Jahanara doubts more and more, and then it slowly dawns that Pagla Pir may be in the pay of the Pakistanis, extracting information about prisoners from desperate women. At the end of the war, it is all too much. Sharif dies of a heart attack. Rumi is gone. Her only son left, Jami, is presented to Major Haider of the new Bangladeshi state to serve as best he can. She is left alone. Of Blood and Fire is a transfixingly powerful book that does not dwell on horrors, but does not avert its eyes, either. It has never been published in the UK (it's available from the University Press Limited), but anyone who reads it will be filled, as the young are now in Shahbagh Square, by the sense of immense injustice beautifully expressed, and of great human warmth through all suffering. It is, literally, a book to found a nation on. Philip Hensher's novel about the Bangladesh war of independence, Scenes from Early Life, is published by Fourth Estate.

জ্যোতির্বিজ্ঞানের গবেষণার ইতিহাস, এরিস্টটল এবং টলেমির ধারণা সহ আলোচনা করেছিলেন। এরিস্টটল, তাঁর সময়ের অন্যান্য অনেক লোকের মতো নয়, পৃথিবীটি গোলাকার বলে মনে করেছিলেন। তিনি চন্দ্রগ্রহণ পর্যবেক্ষণ করে এই সিদ্ধান্তে পৌঁছেছিলেন, যা তিনি মনে করেছিলেন পৃথিবীর বৃত্তাকার ছায়ার ফলে এবং উত্তর দিকে আরও পর্যবেক্ষকদের দৃষ্টিকোণ থেকে উত্তর তারাটির উচ্চতা বৃদ্ধি বৃদ্ধি পর্যবেক্ষণ করে। অ্যারিস্টটল আরও ভেবেছিলেন যে সূর্য ও তারাগুলি পৃথিবীর চারপাশে নিখুঁত চেনাশোনাগুলিতে গিয়েছিল, \"রহস্যবাদী কারণে\" । দ্বিতীয় শতাব্দীর গ্রীক জ্যোতির্বিদ টলেমিও মহাবিশ্বে সূর্য ও নক্ষত্রগুলির অবস্থানের বিষয়ে চিন্তাভাবনা করেছিলেন এবং একটি গ্রহীয় মডেল তৈরি করেছিলেন যা এরিস্টটলের চিন্তাকে আরও বিশদে বিশদ দিয়েছিল।\n\nআজ, এটি জানা গেল যে বিপরীতটি সত্য: পৃথিবী সূর্যের চারদিকে চলে  তারা এবং সূর্যের অবস্থান সম্পর্কে অ্যারিস্টটোলিয়ান এবং টলেমাইক ধারণাগুলি ১৫০৯ সালে অসম্মতি জানানো হয়েছিল। পৃথিবী সূর্যের চারদিকে ঘোরে এমন একটি বিশদ যুক্তি উপস্থাপনকারী প্রথম ব্যক্তি ছিলেন ১৫১৪ সালে পোলিশ পুরোহিত নিকোলাস কোপার্নিকাস। প্রায় এক শতাব্দী পরে গ্যালিলিও গ্যালিলি, একজন ইতালীয় বিজ্ঞানী এবং জোহানেস কেপলার নামক এক জার্মান বিজ্ঞানী কীভাবে কিছু গ্রহের চাঁদ আকাশে সরিয়ে নিয়েছেন এবং কোপার্নিকাসের চিন্তাকে বৈধ করার জন্য তাদের পর্যবেক্ষণগুলি ব্যবহার করেছিলেন তা অধ্যয়ন করেছিলেন।\n\nপর্যবেক্ষণগুলি মাপসই করার জন্য, কেপলার একটি বৃত্তাকার পরিবর্তে একটি উপবৃত্তাকার কক্ষপথের মডেল প্রস্তাব করেছিলেন। প্রিন্সিপিয়া ম্যাথমেটিকা ​​গ্রাভিটি সম্পর্কিত তাঁর ১৬৮৭ সালে গ্রন্থে আইজাক নিউটন কোপারনিকাসের ধারণাকে আরও সমর্থন করার জন্য জটিল গণিত ব্যবহার করেছিলেন। নিউটনের মডেলটির অর্থ হ'ল সূর্যের মতো তারাও স্থির ছিল না, বরং দূর থেকে চলন্ত বস্তু ছিল। তবুও, নিউটন বিশ্বাস করেছিলেন যে মহাবিশ্বটি অসীম সংখ্যক তারা দ্বারা গঠিত যা কম-বেশি স্থির ছিল। জার্মান দার্শনিক হেনরিচ ওলবার্স সহ তাঁর সমসাময়িক অনেকেই একমত নন।\n\nমহাবিশ্বের উৎস শতাব্দী ধরে অধ্যয়ন এবং বিতর্কের আরও একটি দুর্দান্ত বিষয়কে উপস্থাপন করেছিল। অ্যারিস্টটলের মতো প্রাথমিক দার্শনিকরা ভেবেছিলেন যে মহাবিশ্ব চিরকালই রয়েছে, আর সেন্ট অগাস্টিনের মতো ধর্মতত্ত্ববিদরা বিশ্বাস করেছিলেন যে এটি একটি নির্দিষ্ট সময়ে তৈরি হয়েছিল। সেন্ট অগাস্টিনও বিশ্বাস করতেন যে সময়টি একটি ধারণা ছিল যা মহাবিশ্বের সৃষ্টির সাথে জন্ম নিয়েছিল। আরও এক হাজার বছরেরও বেশি পরে, জার্মান দার্শনিক ইমমানুয়েল ক্যান্ট ভেবেছিলেন যে সময়টি চিরতরে ফিরে যায়।\n\n১৯২৯ সালে, জ্যোতির্বিদ এডউইন হাবল আবিষ্কার করেছিলেন যে ছায়াপথগুলি একে অপরের থেকে দূরে সরে যাচ্ছে। ফলস্বরূপ, একটি সময় ছিল, দশ থেকে বিশ বিলিয়ন বছর আগে, যখন তারা সকলেই একক একা অত্যন্ত ঘন জায়গায় ছিল। এই আবিষ্কারটি বিজ্ঞান প্রদেশের মধ্যে মহাবিশ্বের সূচনার ধারণা নিয়ে এসেছিল। আজ, বিজ্ঞানীরা মহাবিশ্বের কার্যকারিতা বর্ণনা করার জন্য দুটি আংশিক তত্ত্ব, আলবার্ট আইনস্টাইনের সাধারণ আপেক্ষিকতা এবং কোয়ান্টাম মেকানিক্স ব্যবহার করেন। বিজ্ঞানীরা এখনও একটি সম্পূর্ণ একীভূত তত্ত্বের সন্ধান করছেন যা মহাবিশ্বের সমস্ত কিছু বর্ণনা করবে। হকিং বিশ্বাস করে যে একটি সম্পূর্ণ একীভূত তত্ত্বের আবিষ্কার আমাদের প্রজাতির বেঁচে থাকতে সহায়তা করতে পারে না, এমনকি আমাদের জীবনযাত্রাকেও প্রভাবিত করতে পারে না, তবে জ্ঞানের প্রতি মানবতার গভীর আকাঙ্ক্ষা আমাদের ক্রমাগত অনুসন্ধানের পক্ষে ন্যায়সঙ্গত এবং আমাদের লক্ষ্য কিছুই নয় আমরা যে ইউনিভার্সে বাস করি তার সম্পূর্ণ বর্ণনার চেয়ে কম।\n\nস্থান এবং সময়\nস্টিফেন হকিং নিউটনীয় তত্ত্বের অনুসরণে পরম মহাকাশের অ্যারিস্টটল তত্ত্বটি কীভাবে শেষ হয়ে গিয়েছিল সে সম্পর্কে আলোচনা করেছেন যে যদি কোনও পর্যবেক্ষক বিশ্রামের সময় ঘটনাটি দেখেন বা যদি তিনি একই গতিতে গতি পান তবে 'বিশ্রাম' এবং 'গতি' একই অবস্থা হতে পারে  ঘটনা. সুতরাং, 'বিশ্রাম' মানক অবস্থান হতে পারে না। তদুপরি, গ্যালিলিও গ্যালিলি অ্যারিস্টটল তত্ত্বকেও অস্বীকার করেছেন যে ভারী দেহগুলি কেবলমাত্র তাদের ভরগুলির কারণে হালকা প্রাণীর চেয়ে আরও দ্রুত পতিত হয়। তিনি পরীক্ষামূলকভাবে এটি বিভিন্ন ওজনের বস্তুগুলি স্লাইড করে প্রমাণ করেছেন এবং এমনকী এই সিদ্ধান্তেও পৌঁছেছেন যে এই উভয় বস্তু একই হারে নেমে আসবে এবং যদি কোনও বাহ্যিক শক্তি তাদের উপর কাজ না করে তবে একই সময়ে নিচে পৌঁছে যাবে।\n\nঅ্যারিস্টটল এবং নিউটন পরম সময়কে বিশ্বাস করেছিলেন। তারা বিশ্বাস করেছিল যে যদি কোনও ইভেন্ট দুটি ভিন্ন ঘড়ি ব্যবহারের গতিতে পৃথকভাবে পরিমাপ করা হয় তবে ব্যবহৃত ঘড়িগুলি সমন্বয়সাধ্য হয়ে উঠলে তাদের একই সময়ে একমত হতে হবে, যা এখন অবধি আমরা জানি যে এটি নয়। তবে আলোটি সীমাবদ্ধ গতির সাথে ভ্রমণ করার বিষয়টি ডেনিশ বিজ্ঞানী ওলে রামারের দ্বারা বৃহস্পতির পর্যবেক্ষণ এবং এর অন্যতম চাঁদ আইও দ্বারা ব্যাখ্যা করেছিলেন। তিনি পর্যবেক্ষণ করেছিলেন যে আইও কখনও কখনও তাত্পর্য এবং কখনও কখনও পরে যখন এটি বৃহস্পতির চারদিকে ঘুরত কারণ পৃথিবী এবং বৃহস্পতির মধ্যবর্তী দূরত্ব প্রতিবার পরিবর্তিত হয় কারণ তাদের সূর্যের প্রদক্ষিণের গতিগুলির কারণে।\n\nআলোর আসল প্রচারটি জেমস ক্লার্ক ম্যাক্সওয়েল প্রকাশ করেছিলেন যিনি সিদ্ধান্ত নিয়েছিলেন যে আলো নির্দিষ্ট গতির সাথে ভ্রমণ করে। পরে, অনেকে যুক্তি দিয়েছিলেন যে আলোকে অবশ্যই ইথার নামক একটি অনুমান তরল পদার্থের মধ্য দিয়ে ভ্রমণ করতে হবে, যা মাইকেলসন – মুরলে পরীক্ষার দ্বারা অস্বীকৃত হয়েছিল। আইনস্টাইন এবং হেনরি পইনকারি পরবর্তীতে যুক্তি দিয়েছিলেন যে এথারের দরকার নেই তবে শর্ত থাকে যে কাউকে পরম সময় ত্যাগ করতে হবে। আপেক্ষিকতার বিশেষ তত্ত্বটি এর উপর ভিত্তি করে তৈরি করা হয় যে আলো পর্যবেক্ষকের গতি যাই হোক না কেন একটি সীমাবদ্ধ গতির সাথে ভ্রমণ করে। তদুপরি, আলোর গতি চূড়ান্ত গতি হিসাবে ধরে নেওয়া হয়।\n\nভর এবং শক্তি বিখ্যাত সমীকরণ   দ্বারাও সম্পর্কিত এবং তাই আলোর গতিতে পেতে অসীম শক্তির প্রয়োজন হবে আলোর গতি ব্যবহার করে একটি মিটার সংজ্ঞায়নের একটি নতুন উপায়ও বিকাশিত। হালকা শঙ্কু, একটি স্পেসটাইম গ্রাফিকাল উপস্থাপনা যা কোন ইভেন্টগুলিকে অনুমোদিত এবং কোনটি অতীত এবং ভবিষ্যতের আলো শঙ্কুগুলির ভিত্তিতে নয় তা সীমাবদ্ধ করে ব্যবহার করে \"ইভেন্টগুলি\" বর্ণিত হতে পারে। নতুন 4-মাত্রাগুলিও বর্ণিত হয়েছে, যখন কেউ 3 D থেকে 4 D বা 3D থেকে 2D থেকে রেফারেন্স পরিবর্তন করে তখন পথটি কতটা আলাদা দেখা যায়।\n\nসম্পর্কিত থিওরি অফ রিলেটিভিটি ব্যাখ্যা করে যে কীভাবে আলোর রশ্মির পথটি 'মাধ্যাকর্ষণ' দ্বারা প্রভাবিত হয়, আইনস্টাইনের মতে নিউটনের মতের বিপরীতে এটি কেবল একটি মায়া। এটি স্পেসটাইম বক্রতা, যেখানে আলো 4D তে সরল পথে চলে তবে 3D-তে বাঁক হিসাবে দেখা যায়। এই সরলরেখার পথগুলি জিওডেসিক। টুইন প্যারাডক্স, অভিন্ন যমজদের সাথে জড়িত বিশেষ আপেক্ষিকতার একটি গবেষণা পরীক্ষা, বিবেচনা করে যে তারা যদি একে অপরের তুলনামূলকভাবে আলাদা গতিতে চলে যায় বা এমনকি এমন জায়গাগুলিতে যেখানে স্পেসটাইম বক্রতা পৃথক হয় তবে আলাদাভাবে বয়স হতে পারে। বিশেষ আপেক্ষিকতা স্থান এবং সময়ের ক্ষেত্রগুলির উপর ভিত্তি করে যেখানে ইভেন্টগুলি ঘটে থাকে, অন্যদিকে সাধারণ আপেক্ষিকতা গতিশীল যেখানে বল স্পেসটাইম বক্ররেখা পরিবর্তন করতে পারে এবং যা বিস্তৃত ইউনিভার্সকে জন্ম দেয়। হকিং এবং রজার পেনরোজ এটি নিয়ে কাজ করেছিলেন এবং পরবর্তীতে সাধারণ আপেক্ষিকতা ব্যবহার করে প্রমাণিত করেছিলেন যে মহাবিশ্বের যদি কোনও সূচনা হয় তবে তার অবশ্যই শেষ হতে হবে।\n\nসম্প্রসারণ মহাবিশ্ব\nএই অধ্যায়ে হকিং প্রথমে বর্ণনা করেছেন যে পদার্থবিদ ও জ্যোতির্বিজ্ঞানীরা পৃথিবী থেকে তারাগুলির আপেক্ষিক দূরত্ব গণনা করেছিলেন। আঠারো শতকে স্যার উইলিয়াম হার্শেল রাতের আকাশে অনেক তারার অবস্থান এবং দূরত্বের বিষয়টি নিশ্চিত করেছিলেন। ১৯২৪ সালে, এডউইন হাবল তারার উজ্জ্বলতা ব্যবহার করে দূরত্ব পরিমাপ করার একটি পদ্ধতি আবিষ্কার করেছিলেন। আলোকিততা, উজ্জ্বলতা এবং দূরত্ব একটি সাধারণ গাণিতিক সূত্রের সাথে সম্পর্কিত। এই সমস্ত ব্যবহার করে, তিনি মোট নয়টি পৃথক গ্যালাক্সির দূরত্বগুলি মোটামুটি গণনা করেছিলেন। আমরা বিস্তীর্ণ নক্ষত্র সমেত অন্যান্য ছায়াপথের মতো একটি সর্পিল ছায়াপথে বাস করি।\n\nতারকারা আমাদের থেকে অনেক দূরে, তাই আমরা কেবল তাদের একটি বৈশিষ্ট্য, তাদের আলো পর্যবেক্ষণ করি। এই আলো যখন প্রিজমের মধ্য দিয়ে যায় তখন এটি একটি বর্ণালীকে জন্ম দেয়। প্রতিটি নক্ষত্রের নিজস্ব বর্ণালী থাকে এবং যেহেতু প্রতিটি উপাদানটির নিজস্ব অনন্য বর্ণালী থাকে, তাই আমরা কোনও তারার সংমিশ্রণটি জানতে পারি। তারার তাপমাত্রা জানতে আমরা তাপীয় বর্ণালী ব্যবহার করি। ১৯২০ সালে, যখন বিজ্ঞানীরা বিভিন্ন তারাগুলির বর্ণালী পরীক্ষা করছিলেন, তারা দেখতে পান যে তারা বর্ণালীটির কয়েকটি বৈশিষ্ট্যযুক্ত রেখা বর্ণালীটির লাল প্রান্তে স্থানান্তরিত হয়েছিল। এই ঘটনার প্রভাবগুলি ডপলার প্রভাব দ্বারা দেওয়া হয়েছিল এবং এটি স্পষ্ট ছিল যে কিছু তারকারা আমাদের থেকে দূরে সরে যাচ্ছেন।\n\nধারণা করা হয়েছিল যেহেতু কিছু তারা লাল স্থানান্তরিত, তাই কিছু তারা নীল শিফটও হবে। যখন পাওয়া গেল, তাদের কোনওটিই নীল স্থানান্তরিত হয়নি। হাবল আবিষ্কার করেছেন যে রেডশিফ্টের পরিমাণ আপেক্ষিক দূরত্বের সাথে সরাসরি আনুপাতিক। সুতরাং, এটি পরিষ্কার ছিল যে মহাবিশ্বটি প্রসারিত হচ্ছে। এটি সত্ত্বেও, ২০তম শতাব্দী পর্যন্ত স্থির ইউনিভার্সের ধারণা অব্যাহত ছিল। আইনস্টাইন একটি স্থির ইউনিভার্স সম্পর্কে এতটাই নিশ্চিত ছিলেন যে তিনি 'মহাজাগতিক ধ্রুবক' বিকাশ করেছিলেন এবং পূর্ববর্তী দাবিটি ধরে রাখতে 'মহাকর্ষবিরোধী' বাহিনী চালু করেছিলেন। তদুপরি, অনেক জ্যোতির্বিদও সাধারণ আপেক্ষিকতার মুখের মূল্য এড়িয়ে যাওয়ার চেষ্টা করেছিলেন এবং রাশিয়ান পদার্থবিজ্ঞানী আলেকজান্ডার ফ্রেডম্যান তার উল্লেখযোগ্য ব্যতিক্রম সহ স্থির ইউনিভার্সের সাথে আটকে ছিলেন।\n\nফ্রিডম্যান দুটি খুব সাধারণ অনুমান করেছিলেন: মহাবিশ্ব প্রতিটি দিকেই একরকম, অর্থাৎ সমকামিতা, এবং আমরা যেখানেই দেখি না কেন এটি সত্য হবে, অর্থাৎ আইসোট্রপি। তার ফলাফলগুলি দেখিয়েছিল যে মহাবিশ্ব অচল। তার অনুমানগুলি পরে প্রমাণিত হয়েছিল যখন বেল ল্যাবসের দুটি পদার্থবিদ, আরনো পেনজিয়াস এবং রবার্ট উইলসন কেবল আকাশের এক বিশেষ অংশ থেকে নয় সমস্ত জায়গা থেকে এবং প্রায় একই পরিমাণে অতিরিক্ত মাইক্রোওয়েভ বিকিরণ শব্দ পেয়েছিলেন। এভাবে ফ্রিডম্যানের প্রথম অনুমান সত্য প্রমাণিত হয়েছিল।\n\nপ্রায় একই সময়ে, রবার্ট এইচ ডিক এবং জিম পিলসও মাইক্রোওয়েভ বিকিরণে কাজ করছিলেন। তারা যুক্তি দিয়েছিল যে তাদের পটভূমি মাইক্রোওয়েভ বিকিরণ হিসাবে প্রাথমিক ইউনিভার্সের আভা দেখতে সক্ষম হওয়া উচিত। উইলসন এবং পেনজিয়াস এরই মধ্যে এটি করেছিলেন, সুতরাং ১৯৭৮ সালে তাদের নোবেল পুরস্কার দেওয়া হয়েছিল। এছাড়াও, মহাবিশ্বে আমাদের স্থান ব্যতিক্রমী নয়, তাই আমাদের মহাবিশ্বকে স্থানের অন্য কোনও অংশ থেকে একই হিসাবে দেখতে পাওয়া উচিত, যা ফ্রিডম্যানের প্রমাণ করে দ্বিতীয় অনুমান। হাওয়ার্ড রবার্টসন এবং আর্থার ওয়াকার দ্বারা একই ধরনের মডেল তৈরি না হওয়া পর্যন্ত তাঁর কাজ বেশিরভাগ ক্ষেত্রেই অজানা ছিল।\n\nফ্রিডম্যানের মডেলটি মহাবিশ্বের তিনটি ভিন্ন ধরনের মডেল জন্ম দেয়। প্রথমত, মহাবিশ্ব নির্দিষ্ট সময়ের জন্য প্রসারিত হবে এবং যদি সম্প্রসারণের হারটি মহাবিশ্বের ঘনত্বের চেয়ে কম হয় (মহাকর্ষীয় আকর্ষণ বাড়ে), এটি শেষপর্যন্ত পরবর্তী পর্যায়ে মহাবিশ্বের পতনের দিকে পরিচালিত করবে। দ্বিতীয়ত, মহাবিশ্বটি প্রসারিত হবে এবং কিছু সময়, যদি মহাবিশ্বের সম্প্রসারণের হার এবং ঘনত্ব সমান হয়, এটি ধীরে ধীরে প্রসারিত হবে এবং অসীম সময়ে থামবে, কিছুটা স্থির ইউনিভার্সের দিকে পরিচালিত করবে। তৃতীয়ত, মহাবিশ্বের সম্প্রসারণের হারের ভারসাম্য রক্ষার জন্য ভার্সনের ঘনত্ব সমালোচনামূলক পরিমাণের চেয়ে কম হলে মহাবিশ্ব চিরকাল প্রসারিত হতে থাকবে।\n\nপ্রথম মডেলটি মহাবিশ্বের স্থানটি বক্ররেখার জন্য চিত্রিত করে যা কিছুটা পৃথিবীর মতো কাঠামো। দ্বিতীয় মডেলটিতে স্থানটি একটি সমতল কাঠামোতে নিয়ে যায় এবং তৃতীয় মডেলের ফলাফল নেতিবাচক বক্রতা বা জিন আকারের হয়। এমনকি যদি আমরা গণনা করি তবে বর্তমান সম্প্রসারণের হারটি অন্ধকার পদার্থ এবং সমস্ত নক্ষত্রের জনসাধারণ সহ মহাবিশ্বের সমালোচনামূলক ঘনত্বের চেয়ে বেশি। প্রথম মডেলটিতে মহাবিশ্বের সূচনা ছিল অসীম ঘনত্বের স্থান এবং 'একবাক্যতা' নামে পরিচিত শূন্য ভলিউমের এক বৃহত ঠাণ্ডা হিসাবে, এটি এমন একটি পয়েন্ট যেখানে আপেক্ষিকতার সাধারণ থিওরি (ফ্রেডম্যানের সমাধানগুলি এর উপর ভিত্তি করে )ও ভেঙে যায়।\n\nসময়ের শুরুর এই ধারণাটি অনেক ধর্মীয় বিশ্বাসের পরিপন্থী ছিল, তাই বিগ ব্যাং তত্ত্বকে সামাল দেওয়ার জন্য একটি নতুন তত্ত্ব চালু করা হয়েছিল, হারমান বন্ডি, টমাস গোল্ড এবং ফ্রেড হোয়েলের \"স্টেডি স্টেট থিওরি\"। এর ভবিষ্যদ্বাণীগুলি বর্তমান ইউনিভার্স কাঠামোর সাথেও মেলে। তবে সত্য যে আমাদের নিকটবর্তী রেডিও তরঙ্গ সূত্রগুলি সুদূর ইউনিভার্সের তুলনায় অনেক কম ছিল এবং বর্তমানের তুলনায় আরও অনেক রেডিও উৎস ছিল, এর ফলে এই তত্ত্বটি ব্যর্থ হয়েছিল এবং প্রত্যেকে অবশেষে বিগ ব্যাং তত্ত্বকে সমর্থন করেছিল।\n\nএভজেনি লিফশিটস এবং আইজাক মার্কোভিচ খালাত্নিকভ বিগ ব্যাং তত্ত্বটি এড়ানোর চেষ্টা করেছিলেন কিন্তু ব্যর্থও হয়েছিলেন। রজার পেনরোজ হালকা শঙ্কু এবং সাধারণ আপেক্ষিকতা ব্যবহার করে প্রমাণিত করেছিল যে একটি ধসে পড়া নক্ষত্রটি শূন্য আকারের এবং অন্ধকারের ঘনত্ব এবং বক্রতা একটি কালো হোল নামে পরিচিত একটি অঞ্চলে পরিণত হতে পারে। হকিং এবং পেনরোজ একসাথে প্রমাণ করেছিলেন যে মহাবিশ্বের এককত্ব থেকে উদ্ভূত হওয়া উচিত ছিল, যা কোয়ান্টামের প্রভাবগুলি বিবেচনায় নেওয়ার পরে হকিং নিজেই এটি অস্বীকার করেছিলেন।\n\nঅনিশ্চয়তা নীতি\nঅনিশ্চয়তার নীতিটি বলে যে একটি কণার গতি এবং অবস্থান একই সাথে খুঁজে পাওয়া যায় না। কোন কণা কোথায় তা খুঁজে পেতে বিজ্ঞানীরা কণায় আলো জ্বলে। যদি উচ্চ ফ্রিকোয়েন্সি আলো ব্যবহার করা হয় তবে আলোটি আরও সঠিকভাবে অবস্থানটি সন্ধান করতে পারে তবে কণার গতি অজানা (কারণ আলো কণার গতি পরিবর্তন করবে)। যদি কম ফ্রিকোয়েন্সি আলো ব্যবহার করা হয়, হালকা গতি আরও নির্ভুলভাবে খুঁজে পেতে পারে তবে কণার অবস্থান অজানা হতে পারে। অনিশ্চয়তার নীতিটি এমন একটি তত্ত্বের ধারণাটিকে অস্বীকার করেছিল যা হতাশাবোধমূলক ছিল, বা এমন কিছু যা ভবিষ্যতে সমস্ত কিছুর পূর্বাভাস দেয়।\n\nহালকা কীভাবে আচরণ করে সে সম্পর্কেও এই অধ্যায়ে আরও আলোচনা করা হয়েছে। কিছু তত্ত্ব বলে যে হালকা সত্যই তরঙ্গ দ্বারা তৈরি হওয়া সত্ত্বেও কণার মতো কাজ করে; একটি তত্ত্ব যা বলে যে এটি প্লাঙ্কের কোয়ান্টাম অনুমান। একটি ভিন্ন তত্ত্ব আরও বলে যে হালকা তরঙ্গগুলি কণার মতোও কাজ করে; এমন একটি তত্ত্ব যা বলে যে এটি হাইজেনবার্গের অনিশ্চিত নীতি।\n\nহালকা তরঙ্গে ক্রেস্ট এবং ট্রাট রয়েছে। একটি তরঙ্গের সর্বোচ্চ পয়েন্ট হ'ল ক্রেস্ট এবং তরঙ্গের সর্বনিম্ন অংশটি গর্ত। কখনও কখনও এই তরঙ্গের একেরও বেশি একে অপরের সাথে হস্তক্ষেপ করতে পারে - ক্রেস্টস এবং ট্রুজগুলি একসাথে থাকে। একে হালকা হস্তক্ষেপ বলে। হালকা তরঙ্গ যখন একে অপরের সাথে হস্তক্ষেপ করে, এটি অনেকগুলি রঙ তৈরি করতে পারে। এর উদাহরণ হ'ল সাবান বুদবুদগুলির রঙ।\nপ্রাথমিক কণা এবং প্রকৃতির বাহিনী\nকোয়ার্কস এবং অন্যান্য প্রাথমিক কণাগুলি এই অধ্যায়ের বিষয়।\nকোয়ার্কস খুব ছোট জিনিস যা আমরা দেখি (বিষয়) সমস্ত কিছু তৈরি করে। কোয়ার্কের ছয়টি পৃথক \"স্বাদ\" রয়েছে: উপরে, নিচে, অদ্ভুত, কবজ, নিচে এবং শীর্ষে। কোয়ার্কের তিনটি \"রঙ\" থাকে: লাল, সবুজ এবং নীল। এ্যান্টিয়ার্কসও রয়েছে, যা নিয়মিত কোয়ারকের বিপরীত। মোট, এখানে ১৮ টি বিভিন্ন ধরনের নিয়মিত কোয়ার্ক এবং ১৮ টি বিভিন্ন ধরনের অ্যান্টিকোয়ার্ক রয়েছে। কোয়ার্কস \"বিল্ডিং ব্লকস অব ম্যাটার্স\" হিসাবে পরিচিত কারণ এগুলি এখনও সবচেয়ে ছোট জিনিস যা আবিষ্কার করেছে যা মহাবিশ্বে সমস্ত বিষয় তৈরি করে।\n\nসমস্ত কণার (উদাহরণস্বরূপ, কোয়ার্ক) স্পিন বলে কিছু রয়েছে। কণার স্পিন আমাদের দেখায় যে কোনও কণা বিভিন্ন দিক থেকে দেখতে কেমন লাগে। উদাহরণস্বরূপ, স্পিন ০ এর একটি কণা প্রতিটি দিক থেকে একই দেখায়। স্পিন ১ এর একটি কণা প্রতিটি দিকে আলাদা দেখায় যতক্ষণ না কণা পুরোপুরি কাটা হয় (360 ডিগ্রি)। হকিংয়ের স্পিন ১ এর একটি কণার উদাহরণটি একটি তীর। দুটি স্পিনের একটি কণাকে দেখতে একইরকম অর্ধেক (বা ১৮০ ডিগ্রি) ঘুরিয়ে দেওয়া দরকার।\n\nবইটিতে দেওয়া উদাহরণটি একটি দ্বি-মাথাযুক্ত তীরের। মহাবিশ্বে দুটি কণার গ্রুপ রয়েছে: ১/২ এর স্পিনযুক্ত কণা এবং ০,১ বা ২ এর স্পিনযুক্ত কণা এই সমস্ত কণা পাওলি বর্জন নীতি অনুসরণ করে। পাওলির বর্জন নীতি (১৯২৫ সালে অস্ট্রিয়ান পদার্থবিদ ওল্ফগ্যাং পাওলি সূচিত) বলে যে কণাগুলি একই জায়গায় হতে পারে না বা একই গতিতে পারে না। যদি পলির বর্জনের নীতিটি না থাকে, তবে মহাবিশ্বের সমস্ত কিছুই প্রায় একই রকম এবং ঘন \"স্যুপ\" এর মতো দেখাবে।\n\n০, ১, বা ২ এর স্পিনযুক্ত কণা একটি কণা থেকে অন্য কণায় চলে আসে। এই কণার কয়েকটি উদাহরণ ভার্চুয়াল গ্র্যাভিটন এবং ভার্চুয়াল ফোটন। ভার্চুয়াল গ্রাভিটনের ২ টি স্পিন থাকে এবং তারা মাধ্যাকর্ষণ শক্তিটিকে উপস্থাপন করে। এর অর্থ হ'ল মহাকর্ষ যখন দুটি জিনিসকে প্রভাবিত করে, তখন গ্র্যাভিটন দুটি জিনিস থেকে আগত হয়। ভার্চুয়াল ফোটনের ১ টি স্পিন থাকে এবং বৈদ্যুতিক চৌম্বকীয় শক্তিগুলি (বা এমন শক্তি যা পরমাণুকে এক সাথে রাখে) উপস্থাপন করে।\n\nমাধ্যাকর্ষণ শক্তি এবং তড়িৎ চৌম্বকীয় শক্তি ছাড়াও দুর্বল এবং শক্তিশালী পারমাণবিক শক্তি রয়েছে। দুর্বল পারমাণবিক শক্তি হ'ল এমন শক্তি যেগুলি তেজস্ক্রিয়তার কারণ ঘটায় বা যখন পদার্থ শক্তি নির্গত করে। দুর্বল পারমাণবিক শক্তি ১/২ এর স্পিন দিয়ে কণায় কাজ করে। শক্তিশালী পারমাণবিক শক্তি হ'ল এমন শক্তি যা কোয়ার্কগুলিকে নিউট্রন এবং প্রোটনকে একসাথে রাখে এবং প্রোটন এবং নিউট্রনকে পরমাণুর সাথে রাখে। শক্তিশালী পারমাণবিক শক্তি বহন করে এমন কণাটি একটি গ্লুয়ান বলে মনে করা হয়। গ্লুনটি একটি স্পিনের কণা ১। গ্লুয়ান প্রোটন এবং নিউট্রন গঠনের জন্য কোয়ার্কগুলি একসাথে ধারণ করে। তবে, গ্লুয়ানটি কেবল তিনটি ভিন্ন রঙের কোয়ার্ক একসাথে রাখে। এটি শেষ পণ্যটির কোনও রঙ নেই। একে কারাবাস বলা হয়।\n\nকিছু বিজ্ঞানী এমন তত্ত্ব তৈরির চেষ্টা করেছিলেন যা বৈদ্যুতিন চৌম্বক শক্তি, দুর্বল পারমাণবিক শক্তি এবং শক্তিশালী পারমাণবিক শক্তিকে একত্রিত করে। এই তত্ত্বকে গ্র্যান্ড ইউনিফাইড থিওরি (বা একটি জিইটি) বলা হয়। এই তত্ত্বটি এই শক্তিকে এক বৃহত একীভূত উপায়ে বা তত্ত্বের সাথে ব্যাখ্যা করার চেষ্টা করে।\n\nকৃষ্ণগহ্বর \nএই অধ্যায়ে ব্ল্যাক হোল সম্পর্কে আরও ব্যাখ্যা করা হয়েছে।\n\nহকিং বুঝতে পেরেছিল যে একটি ব্ল্যাকহোলের ইভেন্ট দিগন্ত কেবল আরও বড় হতে পারে, আরও ছোট নয়। যখনই কোনও কিছু ব্ল্যাকহোলের মধ্যে পড়ে তখন একটি ব্ল্যাকহোলের ইভেন্ট দিগন্তের ক্ষেত্রটি বড় হয়ে যায়। তিনি আরও বুঝতে পেরেছিলেন যে যখন দুটি ব্ল্যাক হোল সংযুক্ত হয়, তখন নতুন ইভেন্ট দিগন্তের আকার দুটি মূল ব্ল্যাক হোলের ইভেন্ট দিগন্তের যোগফলের চেয়ে বড় বা সমান হয়। এর অর্থ হ'ল ব্ল্যাকহোলের ইভেন্ট দিগন্ত কখনই ছোট হতে পারে না।\n\nডিসঅর্ডার, এন্ট্রপি নামেও পরিচিত, ব্ল্যাক হোলের সাথে সম্পর্কিত। একটি বৈজ্ঞানিক আইন আছে যা এন্ট্রপির সাথে করতে হবে। এই আইনকে থার্মোডিনামিকসের দ্বিতীয় আইন বলা হয় এবং এটি বলে যে এনট্রপি (বা ব্যাধি) সর্বদা একটি বিচ্ছিন্ন সিস্টেমে বৃদ্ধি পাবে (উদাহরণস্বরূপ, ইউনিভার্স)। ব্ল্যাকহোলের এনট্রপির পরিমাণ এবং ব্ল্যাক হোলের ইভেন্ট দিগন্তের আকারের মধ্যকার সম্পর্কটি প্রথমে একজন গবেষণা শিক্ষার্থী (জ্যাকব বেকেনস্টাইন) দ্বারা চিন্তা করেছিলেন এবং হকিং প্রমাণিত করেছিলেন, যার গণনা অনুসারে ব্ল্যাক হোলগুলি বিকিরণ নির্গত করে। এটি অদ্ভুত ছিল, কারণ এটি ইতিমধ্যে বলা হয়েছিল যে কোনও কোনও ব্ল্যাকহোলের ইভেন্ট দিগন্ত থেকে বাঁচতে পারে না।\n\n\"ভার্চুয়াল কণাগুলি\" জোড়াগুলির চিন্তা করার সময় এই সমস্যার সমাধান হয়েছিল। এক জোড়া কণা ব্ল্যাকহোলের মধ্যে পড়ে অন্যটি পালাতে পারত। এটি দেখে মনে হবে যে ব্ল্যাকহোলটি কণা নির্গত করছে। এই ধারণাটি প্রথমে অদ্ভুত বলে মনে হয়েছিল, তবে কিছুক্ষণের পরে অনেকে এটি গ্রহণ করেছিলেন।\nthumb|right\nকৃষ্ণগহ্বর\nএই অধ্যায়ে ব্ল্যাক হোল সম্পর্কে আরও ব্যাখ্যা করা হয়েছে।\n\nহকিং বুঝতে পেরেছিল যে একটি ব্ল্যাকহোলের ইভেন্ট দিগন্ত কেবল আরও বড় হতে পারে, আরও ছোট নয়। যখনই কোনও কিছু ব্ল্যাকহোলের মধ্যে পড়ে তখন একটি ব্ল্যাকহোলের ইভেন্ট দিগন্তের ক্ষেত্রটি বড় হয়ে যায়। তিনি আরও বুঝতে পেরেছিলেন যে যখন দুটি ব্ল্যাক হোল সংযুক্ত হয়, তখন নতুন ইভেন্ট দিগন্তের আকার দুটি মূল ব্ল্যাক হোলের ইভেন্ট দিগন্তের যোগফলের চেয়ে বড় বা সমান হয়। এর অর্থ হ'ল ব্ল্যাকহোলের ইভেন্ট দিগন্ত কখনই ছোট হতে পারে না।\n\nডিসঅর্ডার, এন্ট্রপি নামেও পরিচিত, ব্ল্যাক হোলের সাথে সম্পর্কিত। একটি বৈজ্ঞানিক আইন আছে যা এন্ট্রপির সাথে করতে হবে। এই আইনকে তাপগতিবিদ্যার দ্বিতীয় সূত্র বলা হয় এবং এটি বলে যে এনট্রপি (বা ব্যাধি) সর্বদা একটি বিচ্ছিন্ন সিস্টেমে বৃদ্ধি পাবে (উদাহরণস্বরূপ, ইউনিভার্স)। ব্ল্যাকহোলের এনট্রপির পরিমাণ এবং ব্ল্যাক হোলের ইভেন্ট দিগন্তের আকারের মধ্যকার সম্পর্কটি প্রথমে একজন গবেষক শিক্ষার্থী (জ্যাকব বেকেনস্টাইন) দ্বারা চিন্তা করেছিলেন এবং

(2005). Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (in English). London: Bloomsbury/New York City: Scholastic, et al. p. 503. UK /U.S. .Rowling, J. K. (2000). Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (in English). London: Bloomsbury, et al. p.566. UK . বছরের শেষ দিকে সেভেরাস স্নেইপ প্রফেসর ডাম্বলডোরকে হত্যা করে। বইয়ের শেষে, হ্যারি পরবর্তী বছর হগওয়ার্টসে ফিরে না আসার সিদ্ধান্ত নেয় এবং হরক্রাক্সগুলোকে খুঁজে বের করে ধ্বংস করার প্রতিজ্ঞা করে। মূল কাহিনী ডাম্বলডোরের মৃত্যুর পর লর্ড ভলডেমর্ট ক্ষমতা দখলের সকল আয়োজন সম্পন্ন করে এবং জাদু মন্ত্রণালয় দখল করে। হ্যারি, রন ও হারমায়োনি ভোলডেমর্টের অবশিষ্ট তিনটি হরক্রাক্স খুঁজে বের করে ধ্বংস কারার জন্য হগওয়ার্টস স্কুলে ফিরে না আসার সিদ্ধান্ত নেয়। তাদের কাছে হরক্রাক্স বিষয়ক তেমন কোন তথ্য না থাকলেও, তারা ধারণা করে যে বাকী তিনটি হরক্রাক্স হচ্ছে হগওয়ার্টসের দুই প্রতিষ্ঠাতা হেলগা হাফলপাফ ও রোয়েনা র‌্যাভেনক্লর দুইটি বস্তু এবং ভোল্ডেমর্টের সাপ নাগিনী। হাফলপাফ ও র‌্যাভেনক্লর বস্তু দুইটির অবস্থান অজানা এবং সাপটি ভোল্ডেমর্ট তার কাছে সুরক্ষিত করে রেখেছে। হরক্রাক্স খোঁজা শুরু করার পর তারা ধীরে ধীরে ডাম্বলডোরের অতীত ইতিহাস এবং স্নেইপের প্রকৃত উদ্দেশ্য সম্পর্কে জানতে পারে। হ্যারি, রন ও হারমায়োনি ভোল্ডেমার্টের হরক্রাক্সগুলোর মধ্যে সর্বপ্রথম সালাজার স্লিদারিনের লকেট হরক্রাক্সটি জাদু মন্ত্রণালয় থেকে উদ্ধার করে। তারা গড্রিক গ্রিফিন্ডরের তলোয়ারটিও উদ্ধার করে। এই তলোয়ারটি স্বল্পসংখ্যক কয়েকটি বস্তুর মধ্যে অন্যতম যা হরক্রাক্স ধ্বংস করতে সক্ষম। তারপর তারা তলোয়ারটি দ্বারা লকেটটি ধ্বংস করে। তাদের এই যাত্রায় তারা একটি রহস্যময় প্রতীকের সাথে পরিচিত হয়। জেনোফিলিয়াস লাভগুড নামের একজন অদ্ভুত জাদুকর তাদের জানায় যে, এই প্রতীকটি আসলে ডেথলি হ্যালোস এর প্র্তীক। ডেথলি হ্যালোস বলতে তিনটি রহস্যময় বস্তুকে বোঝায়। এগুলো হল- দ্য রিসারেকশান স্টোন বা পুনর্জন্মী পাথর অর্থাৎ একটি পাথর যা মৃতকে জীবিত করতে পারে, দ্য এল্ডার ওয়ান্ড বা একটি অপরাজেয় জাদুদন্ড এবং দ্য ইনভিজিবিলিটি ক্লোক বা একটি প্রকৃত অদৃশ্য হওয়ার আলখাল্লা। হ্যারি জানতে পারে যে ভোল্ডেমর্ট এল্ডার ওয়ান্ডটি খুঁজছে। কিন্তু তারা সিদ্ধান্ত নেয় যে, হরক্রাক্সগুলো খুঁজে বের করা এল্ডার ওয়ান্ডটির চেয়েও জরুরি। তারা গ্রিংগটস জাদুর ব্যাংকে বেল্লাট্রিক্স লেস্ট্র্যাঞ্জ এর ভল্ট ভেঙ্গে প্রবেশ করে এবং হেলগা হাফলপাফের কাপ হরক্রাক্সটি উদ্ধার করে। এসময় হ্যারি জানতে পারে যে আরেকটি হরক্রাক্স হগওয়ার্টসে লুকানো আছে, এবং হ্যারি, রন ও হারমায়োনি হগওয়ার্টসে প্রবেশ করে। তারা সেখানে রোয়েনা র‌্যাভেনক্লর ডায়াডেম হরক্রাক্সটি খুঁজে পায় এবং উভয় হরক্রাক্স ধ্বংস করে। এই বইটি শেষ হয় ব্যাটল অফ হগওয়ার্টস বা হগওয়ার্টসের যুদ্ধ এর মাধ্যমে। হ্যারি, রন ও হারমায়োনি এবং অন্যান্য ছাত্রছাত্রী ও জাদুকর সম্প্রদায়ের সদস্যরা ভোল্ডেমর্টের উত্থানের বিরোধিতা করে এবং ভোল্ডেমর্ট, তার ডেথ ইটার ও অন্যান্য জাদুর প্রাণীদের হাত থেকে হগওয়ার্টসকে রক্ষা করে। বেশ কয়েকটি প্রধান চরিত্র যুদ্ধের প্রাথমিক ধাক্কায় নিহত হয়। হ্যারি আবিষ্কার করে যে, ভোল্ডেমর্ট যখন হ্যারিকে শিশু অবস্থায় আক্রমণ করেছিল, তখন ভোল্ডেমর্ট অনিচ্ছাকৃতভাবে হ্যারিকে একটি হরক্রাক্সে পরিণত করে এবং ভোল্ডেমর্টকে ধ্বংস করতে হলে হ্যারিকেও মারা যেতে হবে। হ্যারি ভোল্ডেমর্টের কাছে আত্মসমর্পণ করে। ভোল্ডেমর্ট হ্যারির উপর কিলিং কার্স বা মৃত্যুশাপ ছুড়ে যা হ্যারিকে জীবন ও মৃত্যুর মাঝামাঝি একটি স্থানে প্রেরণ করে। সেখানে হ্যারির অ্যালবাস ডাম্বলডোর এর সাথে দেখা হয় এবং তিনি তার কাছে ব্যাখ্যা করে বলেন যে, যেহেতু ভোল্ডেমর্ট তার পুনর্জন্মের সময় হ্যারির রক্ত ব্যবহার করেছিল, তাই হ্যারি ভোল্ডেমর্টের যে কোন প্রকার ক্ষতির হাত থেকে সুরক্ষিত। এবং কিলিং কার্সের ফলে হ্যারির মধ্যে থাকা ভোল্ডেমর্টের হরক্রাক্সটি ধ্বংস হয়েছে কিন্তু হ্যারি ইচ্ছা করলে তার দেহে ফিরে যেতে পারবে। তখন, হ্যারি তার দেহে ফিরে আসে এবং যুদ্ধ পুনরায় শুরু হয়। এরপর নেভিল লংবটম নাগিনীকে হত্যার মাধ্যমে সর্বশেষ হরক্রাক্সটি ধ্বংস করলে, হ্যারি ভোল্ডেমর্টকে চূড়ান্তভাবে পরাজিত ও ধ্বংস করতে সক্ষম হয়। এপিলগ এপিলগটিতে ভোল্ডেমর্টের মৃত্যুর উনিশ বছর পরের কিংস ক্রস স্টেশনের একটি ঘটনা বর্ণিত হয়েছে। হ্যারি ও জিনি তাদের দুই ছেলে জেমস সিভিয়াস ও অ্যালবাস সেভেরাসকে হগওয়ার্টসে পাঠাতে আসে। তাদের সাথে তাদের মেয়ে লিলি লুনাও ছিল। রন ও হারমায়োনিও তাদের মেয়ে রোজ ও ছেলে হুগোকে নিয়ে সেখানে আসে।", "references": []}, {"title": "রাউলিং এর সংযোজনা", "content": "150px‎|thumb|left|ডেথলি হ্যালোস বইয়ের প্রচ্ছদ ডেথলি হ্যালোস বইটি

Today show Rowling: I wanted to kill parentsRowling's regret: Mom didn't know about HarryFinished 'Potter'? Rowling explains what happens nextStop your sobbing! More Potter to comePhotos: TODAY goes to Scotland Your photos of Potter celebrationsCheck out the Harry Potter look alikes!More Harry Potter news and features Spoiler alert: This story reveals some key plot points in the final Harry Potter book. So if you've haven't finished the book, J.K. Rowling asks that you not read this story. If you found the epilogue of “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows” rather vague, then J.K. Rowling achieved her goal. The author was shooting for “nebulous,” something “poetic.” She wanted the readers to feel as if they were looking at Platform 9¾ through the mist, unable to make out exactly who was there and who was not. “I do, of course, have that information for you, should you require it,” she told TODAY’s Meredith Vieira rather coyly in her first interview since fans got their hands on the final book. Ummm … yes, please! Rowling said her original epilogue was “a lot more detailed,” including the name of every child born to the Weasley clan in the past 19 years. (Victoire, who was snogging Teddy — Lupin and Tonks’ son — is Bill and Fleur’s eldest.) “But it didn’t work very well as a piece of writing,” Rowling said. “It felt very much that I had crowbarred in every bit of information I could … In a novel you have to resist the urge to tell everything.” But now that the seventh and final novel is in the hands of her adoring public, Rowling no longer has to hold back any information about Harry Potter from her fans. And when 14 fans crowded around her in Edinburgh Castle in Scotland earlier this week as part of TODAY’s interview, Rowling was more than willing to share her thoughts about what Harry and his friends are up to now. Harry, Ron and Hermione We know that Harry marries Ginny and has three kids, essentially, as Rowling explains, creating the family and the peace and calm he never had as a child. As for his occupation, Harry, along with Ron, is working at the Auror Department at the Ministry of Magic. After all these years, Harry is now the department head. “Harry and Ron utterly revolutionized the Auror Department,” Rowling said. “They are now the experts. It doesn’t matter how old they are or what else they’ve done.” Meanwhile, Hermione, Ron’s wife, is “pretty high up” in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, despite laughing at the idea of becoming a lawyer in “Deathly Hallows.” “I would imagine that her brainpower and her knowledge of how the Dark Arts operate would really give her a sound grounding,” Rowling said. Harry, Ron and Hermione don’t join the same Ministry of Magic they had been at odds with for years; they revolutionize it and the ministry evolves into a “really good place to be.” “They made a new world,” Rowling said. The wizarding naturalistLuna Lovegood, the eccentric Ravenclaw who was fascinated with Crumple-Horned Snorkacks and Umgubular Slashkilters, continues to march to the beat of her own drum. “I think that Luna is now traveling the world looking for various mad creatures,” Rowling said. “She’s a naturalist, whatever the wizarding equivalent of that is.” Luna comes to see the truth about her father, eventually acknowledging there are some creatures that don’t exist. “But I do think that she’s so open-minded and just an incredible person that she probably would be uncovering things that no one’s ever seen before,” Rowling said. Luna and Neville Longbottom? It’s possible Luna has also found love with another member of the D.A. When she was first asked about the possibility of Luna hooking up with Neville Longbottom several years ago, Rowling’s response was “Definitely not.” But as time passed and she watched her characters mature, Rowling started to “feel a bit of a pull” between the unlikely pair. Ultimately, Rowling left the question of their relationship open at the end of the book because doing otherwise “felt too neat.” Mr. and Mrs. Longbottom: “The damage is done.” There is no chance, however, that Neville’s parents, who were tortured into madness by Bellatrix Lestrange, ever left St. Mungo’s Hospital for Magical Maladies. “I know people really wanted some hope for that, and I can quite see why because, in a way, what happens to Neville’s parents is even worse than what happened to Harry’s parents,” Rowling said. “The damage that is done, in some cases with very dark magic, is done permanently.” Photos by Andrew Kandel for TODAYshow.com Rowling said Neville finds happiness in his grandmother’s acceptance of him as a gifted wizard and as the new herbology professor at Hogwarts. The fate of Hogwarts Nineteen years after the Battle of Hogwarts, the school for witchcraft and wizardry is led by an entirely new headmaster (“McGonagall was really getting on a bit”) as well as a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. That position is now as safe as the other teaching posts at Hogwarts, since Voldemort’s death broke the jinx that kept a Defense Against the Dark Arts professor from remaining for more than a year. While Rowling didn’t clarify whether Harry, Ron and Hermione ever return to school to finish their seventh year, she did say she could see Harry popping up every now and again to give the “odd talk” on Defense Against the Dark Arts. More details to come? Rowling said she may eventually reveal more details in a Harry Potter encyclopedia, but even then, it will never be enough to satisfy the most ardent of her fans. “I’m dealing with a level of obsession in some of my fans that will not rest until they know the middle names of Harry’s great-great-grandparents,” she said. Not that she’s discouraging the Potter devotion! “I love it,” she said. “I’m all for that.” Wild About HarryBlog: J.K.

She took audience questions and was asked if Dumbledore found \"true love\". \"Dumbledore is gay,\" she said, adding he was smitten with rival Gellert Grindelwald, who he beat in a battle between good and bad wizards long ago. The audience gasped, then applauded. \"I would have told you earlier if I knew it would make you so happy,\" she said. \"Falling in love can blind us to an extent,\" she added, saying Dumbledore was \"horribly, terribly let down\" and his love for Grindelwald was his \"great tragedy\". \"Oh, my god,\" Rowling, 42, concluded with a laugh, \"the fan fiction\". Rowling said her books are a \"prolonged argument for tolerance\" Fan sites have long speculated on Dumbledore's sexuality as he was known for having a mysterious, troubled past. Rowling told the audience that while working on the planned sixth Potter film, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, she saw the script carried a reference to a girl who was once of interest to Dumbledore. She said she ensured director David Yates was made aware of the truth about her character. Gay rights campaigner Peter Tatchell welcomed the news about Dumbledore and said: \"It's good that children's literature includes the reality of gay people, since we exist in every society. \"But I am disappointed that she did not make Dumbledore's sexuality explicit in the Harry Potter book. Making it obvious would have sent a much more powerful message of understanding and acceptance.\" And a spokesman for gay rights group Stonewall added: \"It's great that JK has said this. It shows that there's no limit to what gay and lesbian people can do, even being a wizard headmaster.\" Daniel Radcliffe plays Harry Potter in the films Rowling also did a brief reading from the seventh book in her best-selling series, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, as part of her Open Book Tour of the US - her first there for seven years. She said she regarded her novels as a \"prolonged argument for tolerance\" and urged her fans to \"question authority\". But she added that not everyone likes her work. Christian groups have alleged the books promote witchcraft. The author said her revelation about Dumbledore would give them one more reason. The seventh Potter book broke sales records on both sides of the Atlantic when it was published in July, selling 11 million copies in 24 hours. The fifth film adaptation of the series, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix was released this summer. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is due for release late next year.

It is a comic love story set in Bath about a young reader who must learn how to separate fantasy from reality. Miss Austen sold the novel (then entitled Susan) to a publisher in 1803, and the work was advertised but never published. She bought it back many years later, and her brother Henry Austen published the novel as Northanger Abbey after her death in 1817. Sense and Sensibility was the first of Jane Austen's novels to be published. She began to write it sometime around 1797, and she worked on it for many years before its publication in 1811. The title page said that it was written \"By a Lady\", and only her immediate family knew that Jane Austen was the author. Impetuous Marianne Dashwood tumbles into a fairytale romance that goes sour, and her practical older sister Elinor copes with the family's financial problems while hiding her own frustrated romantic hopes. The book was a success, and it even earned a profit! This means that at this time, great slots like Texas Tea, Monopoly Slots and Wheel of Fortune are unavailable to Canadian players. Pride and Prejudice was first written in the late 1700's, then rewritten in 1811-1812 and finally published in early 1813. It is probably the most-read of all of Jane Austen's novels and is a popular favorite among many. Originally entitled First Impressions, the novel deals with the misjudgments that often occur at the beginning of an acquaintance and how those misjudgments can change as individuals learn more about each other. Mansfield Park was written between February, 1811 and the summer of 1813. It was the third novel Jane Austen had published and it first appeared on May 4, 1814. During her lifetime, it was attributed only to \"The author of Sense and Sensibility and Pride and Prejudice\", and the author's identity was unknown beyond her family and friends. It is Jane Austen's most complex novel and deals with many different themes, from the education of children, to the differences between appearances and reality. The version of the novel housed here at Austen.com is slightly annotated. Lovers' Vows: This is the play that the Bertrams wish to enact in the first volume of Mansfield Park. In addition to the text of the play, a synopsis is provided here, as well as a short analysis explaining some of the objections to the play within the novel and a cast list. Emma was written in 1814-1815, and while Jane Austen was writing it, it was suggested to her by a member of the Prince Regents' household that she dedicate it to His Royal Highness. Austen took the suggestion as it was intended--as a command--and Emma was thus dedicated, but the dedication itself is rather slyly worded. Emma deals with a young woman's maturation into adulthood and the trouble she gets herself into along the way. The version of the novel housed here at Austen.com is slightly annotated. Persuasion was written in 1815-1816, while Jane Austen was suffering from her fatal illness. She was still working on some revisions at the time of her death in 1817. The novel was published posthumously by her brother, Henry Austen. Persuasion is a novel of second chances, expectations of society, and the constancy of love. You can also read the preface which Henry wrote telling the world of his sister's authorship, life, and untimely death: A Biographical Notice of the Author. Jane Austen's works from her childhood are full of enthusiasm, humor, and very creative spelling. We do not host the texts of the Juvenilia or her uncompleted works at Austen.com.

May 7, 2009, 13:13 GMT It is a truth universally acknowledged that fans of the 1995 A&E and BBC co-production of Pride and Prejudice will be very pleased with this latest incarnation of the beloved mini-series. Painstakingly converted to hi-def and presented in Blu-ray format enhanced with a collection of new featurettes, this set belongs in the collections of fans and Jane Austen enthusiasts. When Pride and Prejudice came to television as a six episode mini-series in the mid 90s, it was an instant hit and helped to spur on Austen-Mania that exists even today. A combination of good actors such as Colin Firth playing the proud Mr. Darcy, and Jennifer Ehle as the feisty Elizabeth Bennet and careful attention to scenery, costume and daily living details of Regency England, make this production a stunning complement to Jane Austens words. It set the bar for authenticity and attention to authors intent when re-creating the past with television dramas. Pride and Prejudice is the favorite Jane Austen novel of many, and has been dramatized a number of times. Each production has its merits and flaws. For many this is the best, because of careful screenwriting, genius in cast selecting, and a sense of it being real, that it is possible to peek in on the Bennet family as they squabble, or on the Bingley sisters as they find fault with the neighbors to impress Mr. Darcy. By the end of the story, one feels as if these are friends or acquaintances, and that the action continues on in life. As much as they love this production, fans have long been dissatisfied with available reproductions of the series, the earlier being too red in tone, and the later having a washed out appearance in an attempt to rectify the color mistakes. This new Blu-ray has perfect color, and a wonderful appearance. Other reviewers have spoken of a graininess in the picture reproduction, and I really think this depends a lot on your set up and on your personal taste. The resident scientist and I cant agree on what looks clear on any production or player, so what may be grainy looking to one might be sharp to the other. In any event I did not find anything objectionable in the quality and reproduction of the picture, and it is much better than what we have had to view. This Blu-ray is presented in a two disc set with a playing time of five hours and twenty three minutes for the series. There are some really nice specials added to the set, and my only complaint would be that the short featurette from the DVD Special Edition of a few years ago was not included. However, there is Lasting Impressions where interviews with cast and crew investigate the popularity of both the novel and the series, as well as how characters were developed from Jane Austens words and the actors particular take on them. In An Impromptu Walkabout with Adrian Lukis and Lucy Briers, these two cast members Wickham and Mary Bennet give recollections of filming and memories of production as they tour a setting. Turning Point discusses how this production of Pride and Prejudice and how its attention to details changed how historical dramas were made. Finally the featurette Uncovering the Technical Restoration Process is the revelation of the journey it has taken for the production to be restored. Using the 16mm film negative as a starting point, Pride and Prejudice has been converted frame by frame into an incredible HD format. This conversion took much time and many talents, and viewers will enjoy seeing how the transformation took place. Pride and Prejudice [Blu-ray] is now available at Amazon.

MEDIEVAL ISLAMIC PERIOD Following the cultural shock and the crisis of identity that occurred in the first century after the fall of the Sasanids, the urban literati of Persian origin began to reconstruct the cultural idea of Iran within the Islamic society. A modified version of the pre-modern, Sasanid ethno-national identity, this new cultural identity does not bear much resemblance to the modern notions of political and “civic-national identity” (for definitions, see i, above; for the Sasanid period, see ii, above). The emergence of a new form of Persian as the literary language of Iran, as well as a gradual revival of Iranian traditional history, helped buttress the new Iranian cultural identity. The Persian cultural revival, beginning in the early Abbasid Caliphate, accelerated during the reign of Iranian regional dynasties and laid the foundation of Iranian cultural identity for centuries to come (see IRAN iii. TRADITIONAL HISTORY). This manner of revival and reconstruction of the Iranian identity was unparalleled among the other ancient cultural areas that were incorporated into the Islamic world. Thus, while Syria and Egypt lost their languages under the hegemony of Arabic, Iran survived as the main cultural area in the emerging Islamic empire that maintained its distinct linguistic and cultural identity (see, e.g., Frye, pp. 1-6). A number of authors have recently questioned the revival and reconstruction of Iranian identity in the Islamic period. They contend that the idea of Iran and the continuity of its dynastic history is a modern construct, ‘invented’ by western Orientalists in the 18th and 19th centuries. Even the name “Iran,” they argue, had been rarely used in classical Persian literature, and its frequent use in the Šāh-nāma referred to the pre-Islamic era and not to its contemporary existence (Vaziri, 1993; Fragner, 1999). Such interpretations of Iranian identity seem to have been influenced by Eurocentric notions of national identity, drawn from Western civic-territorial experiences of nationhood and nationalism. Pre-modern, non-Western nations do not fit easily into this ethnocentric Western paradigm. The idea of nationhood in societies of Asia is often derived from fictive genealogical and territorial origins and vernacular culture and religion, whereas Western ideas of nationhood have been historically based on the specific boundaries, the development of legal-rational communities, and civic cultures (see Smith, 2004, pp. 132-34; see also i, above). The present entry examines the revival of Iranian identity and repeated construction in Persian literature of its pre-modern ethno-national historiography from the 9th to the 18th century, long before the emergence of Western nationalism or ‘Orientalism.’ Iranian identity and the pattern of the use of the term “Iran” in Persian literature evolved in four main phases in the medieval Islamic era: a revival phase under the Persian regional dynasties; a rather complex phase under the Saljuqs, a resurgence phase under the Mongols and Timurids; and finally, the formation of a hybrid Iranian-Shiʿite identity under the Safavids. IRANIAN IDENTITY IN THE EARLY ISLAMIC PERIOD The resistance movements. The initial Persian response to the Arab domination seems to have manifested itself in various sectarian movements against the Umayyad rule either through participating in the Kharejite revolts or in the Shiʿite movements (see IRAN ix/2.1. The Advent of Islam in Iran). Influenced by pre-Islamic religious ideas, specially Mazdakism, Persian peasants and artisans took part in a series of rebellions against the Arab domination during the early Abbasid era, including those of Behā-fariḏ (q.v.), Sonbāḏ the Magian, Ostādsis, Moqannaʿ, Bābak, and Māziār (see Sadighi, 1937; Yarshater, 1983b). There is some uncertainty, however, regarding the extent to which “national,” or more accurately “ethnic” sentiments, were involved in these revolts. According to some historians, a strong “national” sentiment or even resurrection (rastāḵiz) was at the core of these rebellious movements (see, e.g., Zarrinkub, 1957, pp. 207-66). On the other hand, M. Rekaya sees these movements as last-ditch efforts by members of the old elite to hold on to their privileges and devoid of any “national” sentiments (Rekaya, 1973, 1974). Taking a historicizing perspective, H. A. R. Gibb, sees these anti-Arab and anti-Islamic movements as manifestations of Persian resistance “if nationalism is too strong or misleading a term” (Gibb, p. 66; see also Minorsky, 1955, p. 243). Regardless of motivations, it is plausible to assume that the participants in these movements were inspired by various elements of pre-Islamic Persian cultural heritage. The revival of the cultural idea of Iran in the context of the Islamic civilization, however, occurred primarily through the efforts of the Persian literati in the early part of the Abbasid Caliphate and under the rule of Persian regional dynasties. Iranian regional dynasties. The rise of the Abbasid Caliphate in the mid-8th century—with strong Persian support—helped to bring about the downfall of the Umayyad rule with its policy of Arab supremacy (see Agha, 2003). The shift of the center of the Islamic empire from Syria to Iraq, the central province of the Sasanid empire bearing the rich legacy of Persian and Persianized Aramaean cultures, contributed further to the revival of Iranian identity (see Yarshater, 1998, pp. 54-74; see also Moḥammadi Malāyeri). Furthermore, the rise of de facto autonomous Iranian dynasties during the 9th and 10th centuries—in Khorasan (Taherids, 820-872, and Saffarids, 868-903), Central Asia (Samanids, 914-999), and the Caspian region, central, southern, and western Iran (Ziyarids, Kakuyids, and Buyids [q.v.], 932-1056)—contributed significantly to the revival of Persian cultural heritage (see Frye, pp. 186-212). The desire of these dynasties to identify themselves as “Iranians” was manifested in their invented genealogies, which described them as descendents of pre-Islamic kings, and legends as well as the use of the title of šāhanšāh by the Buyid rulers (Tāriḵ-e Sistān, pp. 200-202; Minorsky, 1955, pp. 244-45; Amedroz, 1905, pp. 393-99; Stern, 1971, p. 538; Bosworth, 1973, pp. 51-62; Madelung, 1969, pp. 168-83). These dynasties provided the Persian literati with the opportunity to revive the idea of Iran. Persian literati. As an influential stratum in Iran’s social hierarchy in the Islamic society, the Persian literati or the “men of the pen” (ahl-e qalam), consisted of bureaucrats—including viziers, scribes (dabirs), and accountants (mostawfis)—men of letters and poets, historians and geographers, philosophers and Islamic theologians, jurists, and scholars of traditional sciences. Dabirs (q.v.), who had survived as a distinct social class after the Arab conquest of Persia, constituted the core of the emerging Persian literati and civilian administration (see DIVĀN iv). They played a significant role in the transmission of pre-Islamic bureaucratic skills and lifestyles under the Arab caliphs and later under Iranian local dynasties and the Turkish potentates. In effect, they provided the social base for the institution of the vizierate. The vizier was the head of the supreme divān, and as such was the head of the government’s bureaucracy. A common feature of medieval society was the existence of influential bureaucratic families of Persian origin, such as the Jeyhānis, the Balʿamis (qq.v.) and ʿOtbis under the Samanids, the family of Neẓām-al-Molk in the Saljuq period, and, the Jovaynis (q.v.) and the family of Rašid-al-Din Fażl-Allāh under the Il-khanids (see DABIR ii; Klausner, pp. 37-81). The dehqāns (q.v.) also helped the reconstruction of Persian culture from pre-Islamic to the Islamic period. As regional landed gentry, dehqāns administered local affairs and collected taxes during the late Sasanid era. In the early Islamic period, dehqāns played a significant part in the transmission of stories from the Iranian epic, Šāh-nāma, Iranian traditional history, and romances of pre-Islamic Iran (see also Tafazzoli, 2000). Persian literati performed their task by contributing to the formation of the administrative apparatus of the Abbasid empire on the Sasanid model, translation of major works of traditional history and ethics from Middle Persian into Arabic and production of Persian recension of them, reconstruction of Persian genealogies for the Iranian regional dynasties, and initiation and promotion of the šoʿubiya literary movement. The šoʿubiya movement. Those members of Persian literati and a number of Arab poets and prose writers, who were active in the šoʿubiya controversy during the 9th and 10th centuries, contributed significantly to the rise of Persian literature and the revival of Iranian cultural identity. Over time, the key term of the Qorʾanic verse 49:13, characterized as the divine order for the equality of all peoples (šoʿub) within Islam, was used to refer to a diffuse literary movement known as šoʿubiya. The Persian literati used the verse to claim equality with, or supremacy to, the Arab aristocracy. The contrast between the glorious, pre-Islamic Persian civilization and the primitive and unsophisticated tribal lifestyle of the Arab Bedouins is the main theme of the šoʿubi literature, which generally satirizes Arabs for their diet of snakes, mice, lizards, and camel milk. Some of the šoʿubis went so far as to deny any virtue in the Arab culture or even in Islam. A vivid example of the claim for Persian superiority may be seen in a poem by Ebrāhim b. Mamšāḏ of Isfahan, a panegyric written for the Saffarid, Yaʿqub b. Layṯ: “I am the son of the noble descendants of Jam, and the inheritance of the kings of Persia has fallen to my lot. … I am reviving their glory, which has been lost and effaced by the length of time. … Say then to all sons of Hashem: Return to your country in the Hejaz, to eat lizards and to graze your sheep. … For I shall mount the throne of kings, by the help of the edge of my sword and the point of my pen” (cited in Yaqut, Eršād al-arīb, pp. 322-23; English tr. from Stern, 1971, pp. 541-42). The šoʿubiya controversy may be seen as a vivid manifestation of the revival of Iranian ethnic pride and the cultural identity of the time, a variant of pre-modern ethno-nationalism (for a nationalistic interpretation of the movement, see; Homāʾi; Ṣafā, Adabiyāt I, 3rd ed., 1959, pp. 25-29; Zarrinkub, 2004, pp. 296-301; as well as Ignaz Goldziher, 1889, tr. 1966, pp. 137-200; and Samuel Stern, p. 545; for modernist denial of a nationalistic element in the movement, see G. Lecomte, p. xiii; and Fragner, 1999, pp. 16-18; for a balanced, historicizing view, see, Gibb, 1953; and Mottahedeh, 1976). Reexamining the meaning of šoʿub in the Qorʿān commentaries, Mottahedeh has argued convincingly that the meaning of šaʿb in many Persian commentaries, and other sources, does not refer to a large confederacy of genealogically arranged tribes or qabāʾel, but to the territorial identification of non-Arab social groups. In this reading of the text, šoʿub clearly refers to Persians and other non-Arabs, who were for the most part sedentary peoples, identifying themselves with a locality. Iranian identity was, therefore, reconstructed mainly on the basis of a territorially oriented view of the origin of the Iranian peoples: those who lived in any part of the Iranian territory (Irānzamin or Irānšahr) and thus had presumably descended from fictive Iranian ancestors and shared a common Persian culture. This broad basis for the post-Islamic construction of Iranian identity seems to have survived until modern times, providing the foundation for the construction of a distinct Iranian “national identity.” The šoʿubiya literary movement not only signified the revival of Iranian ethnic pride, but also became a motivating force for preservation and dissemination of Iran’s traditional history and cultural heritage with the aid of the emerging Persian literary language. Persian literature and the revival of Iranian identity. It is widely acknowledged that the rise of the Persian literature during the 9th-11th centuries significantly helped the reconstruction of a distinct Iranian cultural identity during the medieval Islamic era. Evolved from dari (q.v.), a vernacular of the eastern regions, the new literature soon developed from a simple, popular folk poetry to the language of the court and the bureaucracy, producing a stylistically refined and sophisticated poetry. Iran, for the first time in her long history, had a cultivated, standardized literary language that became a medium of communication widely accepted by all peoples within its boundaries. It expanded from Khorasan and Transoxania to the central, southern, and western regions and eventually became the lingua franca of the chancery and literati of most Islamic dynasties (see IRAN viii. PERSIAN LITERATURE; see also Lazard; Wickens; Richter-Bernburg). The desire to preserve the ethno-national history of Iran, as depicted in ḵʷadāy-nāmaqs, may have been a motive for the Persian literati to promote a written literature in the late Sasanid period as well as New Persian literature in the early Islamic era. It was in these critical periods that the construction of Iranian identity by rearrangement of Persian mythologies, legendry narratives, and factual history took place: “A clear concept of Persian identity permeates the traditional history—a concept that may have originated in the Achaemenid period, but was definitely embraced by the Sasanids, who by calling themselves ‘kings of Iran and non Iran (an-ērān)’ clearly distinguished their own nation from the rest” (IRAN iii. TRADITIONAL HISTORY, p. 300). The arranged “nationalistic spirit of Sasanid tradition,” as Ehsan Yarshater has noted, intended to promote ethnic pride leading to a sense of pre-modern “national identity” for Iranian people. He makes a clear distinction between a belief in the ‘primordial’ origin of Iranian people and Iran’s factual history. What is implied by his analysis is that it was the primordial feature of these myths and symbols, rather than the truth of their historical narratives, that provided the Iranian people with a sense of common origin as a pre-modern “nation.” These symbols and myths had long been used as ‘border guardians’ for preserving the cultural identity of Iranians against the inroads of non-Iranians (anērān), including the Turanians, and the Hephthalites (q.v.). Preserved and disseminated by the šāh-nāmas, these historical memories laid the foundation of Iranian cultural identity as preserved in classical Persian literature. The first part of Ferdowsi’s (q.v.) Šāh-nāma reveals the roots of Iranian identity in ancient mythology. Ahura Mazda created the first man and the first king who laid the foundation of Iranian origin. It was the Kayanid Faridun (see FAREˈəDUN) who divided the world into three parts with peoples of distinct ethnic characters and identities. Examining the basic characters of his three sons, Faridun assigned them to rule over the people of similar characters. Iran, occupying the middle clime, the best part of the world, was assigned to Iraj (q.v.), while Rum (Greece and Rome), on Iran’s western flank, was assigned to Salm, and Turān and China, on the eastern flank, were assigned to Tur. Salm, the king of Rum, is the prototype of the wise, patient ruler. Tur, the king of “Turān and Čin” (i.e., Central Asia) is characterized as being impatient, courageous, and passionate. Iraj, the king of Iran, partakes of both these traits in his character. He is wise, patient, and prudent yet able to act swiftly and boldly if warranted (Šāh-nāma, ed. Khaleghi I, pp. 104-55; for further discussion of Iranian ethnic character, see Ashraf, 1994). Rooted deeply in Persian cosmology and cosmogony (q.v.), an important element of Iranian identity is the notion that Iran is destined to be buffeted forever by its external enemies, who, out of jealousy and fear, conspire continually against the kingdom and its people. The enemies of Iran, be they the wise Westerners or the fearless people of the East, are linked to the evil forces of Ahriman. Iran itself, came into being at the same time as anērān (“non-Iran” or “anti-Iran”). During the reign of the Kayanids a war breaks out among the three parts of the world, with the conflict between Iran and Turān reaching a new height. Alexander invades Iran, overthrows the Kayanids, and on the advice of his mentor, Aristotle, concocts the second major conspiracy against Iran by dividing the country into several regions, leading to the rule of local princes and governors (moluk al-ṭawāyef ). This is done in the hope of obviating the Persian threat against the West (Greek and Roman world; for Aristotle’s letter to Alexander, see Stern, 1970, pp. 25-34). Even worse is his pillaging of Persian cultural treasures of sacred knowledge, philosophy, science, and technology, some of which are translated while the original versions are destroyed. As a result, the translation of Greek works to Persian during the late Sasanid era and to Arabic during the early Islamic period may be seen as returning the Persian repertoire of knowledge back into the hands of their original possessors (see Bailey, p. 155; Ebn al-Nadim, p. 300; Mojmal al-tawāriḵ wa’l-qeṣasá, p. 10; see also Gutas, pp. 34-52). Many of the myths surrounding these events, as they appear in the Šāh-nāma, were of Sasanid origin, during whose reign political and religious authority become fused and the comprehensive idea of Iran was constructed (see IRAN iii. TRADITIONAL HISTORY; see also Gnoli, 1988; and ii, above). The idea of fusing Zoroastrian and Abrahamic traditions through creating genealogical links between Persian kings and Biblical prophets, or even merging them into one as reflections of the same entity, as conceived, inter alia, by Ṭabari (d. 923), Balʿami (q.v.; d. 963), and Gardizi (q.v.; d. 1050) led to legitimizing the roots of Iranian identity in Islamic society. The motivation behind forming this idea may be attributed to a scholarly obsession to forge a symbiosis of fecund and powerful systems of beliefs that happened to co-exist at the same time in the same cultural milieu, or to the lack of knowledge of pre-Parthian factual history, or to a genuine desire for legitimization of Persian roots—which seems to be the case for Gardizi and the translators of Ṭabari’s Tafsir—or an amalgam of all these factors. Yet, regardless of motivation, the dissemination of this idea helped to legitimize the roots of Iranian identity for the devout Persian Muslims for the later centuries. Treating the history of children of Abraham and ancient Persians synchronously, Ṭabari suggests that the Persians believe Kayomarṯ (see GAYŌMARD) was Adam and Hušang-e Pišdād (see HOŠANG), Kayomarṯ’s grandson and successor, was the first man to rule over the seven regions of the earth. In fact, according to some Persian legends, Hušang was the son of Adam and Eve. The story of Solomon is followed by the story of mythical Persian kings. In his rendition of Ṭabari’s history, Balʿami quotes contradictory legends and beliefs about the creation of man and society in order to demonstrate the evolution of the Iranian and Arab wings of the Islamic civilization. Iranian and Abrahamic myths are brought together to form a unified body of mythology (Ṭabari, I, pp. 100 ff.; Balʿami, pp. 112-17). Other Islamic historians, including Maqdesi (Moqaddasi; d. 1004) and Masʿudi (d. ca. 956), also attempted to reconcile and synchronize the Persian and Abrahamic traditions. In the course of the intermingling of “Arab and Persian” aristocracy, one may note the emergence of a Persianized Islamic geographical notion that the region comprising the land of Persia and Arabia was selected by God as the center of the three climes (q.v.; kešvars) of the earth and were inhabited by the noblest of peoples. Thus, genealogies of both Persian and Arab nobility were honored in the new territory. In Gardizi’s words, “And God created different peoples as the land including Mecca, Medina, Ḥejāz, Yemen, Iraq, Khorasan, Nimruz and parts of Šām (Syria) are known in Persian as Iran.” He further adds, that “from the beginning of the world until now [its] people have been respected and have been masters of all around them and none has been taken as slave by other lands. … the people of this mid-clime of the world are wiser, more courageous and more generous than others and their neighbors are inferior to them in all these respects” (see Gardizi, Zayn al-aḵbār, p. 255). Also implied in Gardizi’s conception of identity is the notion that territorial ties represent genealogical origins (for an informative survey of traditional cartography and the conception of borders and partitions in Islamic societies, see Hartley and Woodward, I/1.). Still a novel idea to unify the Persian and Abrahamic traditions was conceived by translators of Ṭabari’s Tafsir (exegesis of the Qurʾan) from Arabic to Persian. In an introduction to the translation they noted, “He [The Almighty God] said, ‘I have never sent a messenger except one conversant in the language of his people and a language comprehensible to them.’ Furthermore, the Persian language was known from the earliest times and from the time of Adam until the era of Ishmael the prophet all divine messengers and all rulers on earth spoke in Persian. The first person to speak in the Arabic tongue was Ishmael the prophet; and our Prophet came from amongst the Arabs and the Qurʾan was sent down to him in Arabic; but here in this region the language is Persian, and the rulers here are of Persian descent” (tr. of Ṭabari’s Tafsir, 1960, p. 5). The existence of a distinct cultural conception of being Iranian (Irāniyat) is most dramatically demonstrated in the trial of Afšin (q.v.) in 840. He was the hereditary ruler of Ošrusana and the commander who defeated Bābak’s (q.v.) 20-year-long rebellion to save the Abbasids. Afšin, who was accused of propagating Iranian ethno-national sentiment, said, “Didn’t I communicate to you [i.e., those who testified against him] my inner secrets and tell you about the concept of Persian national consciousness (al aʿjamiyya) and my sympathies for it and for its exponents?” (Ṭabari, tr., XXXIII, p. 189). This episode clearly reveals not only the presence of a distinct awareness of Iranian cultural identity and the people who actively propagated it, but also of the existence of a concept (al-aʿjamiya or Irāniyat) to convey it. To examine some of the ways in which the idea of Iran and its pre-modern ethno-national history has found expression in Persian literature, we shall briefly survey in the following sections the territorial and ethnic vocabulary of the concept of “Iran” and its related terms, as well as the frequency and pattern of its usage in Persian literature during several periods of Iran’s history over a millennium, stretching from the 9th-10th to the 19th century. Territorial and ethnic vocabulary for Iran. Territorial notions of “Iran,” are reflected in such terms as irānšahr, irānzamin, or Fors, the arabicized form of Pārs/Fārs (Persia). The ethnic notion of “Iranian” is denoted by the Persian words Pārsi or Irāni, and the Arabic term ahl al-fors (inhabitants of Persia) or ʿAjam, referring to non-Arabs, but primarily to Persians as in molk-e ʿAjam (Persian kingdom) or moluk-e ʿAjam (Persian kings). The term Tāzik/Tājik found currency as a term referring to Persian people during the period of Turkic domination. The Persian term kešvar (country) was used in pre-modern times to denote both the clime (e.g., haft kešvar [q.v.] “seven climes”) and the dynastic realm or kingdom. The latter usage of the term only rarely conveyed the meaning of “country” in medieval historiography. The most common equivalent of kešvar was the Arabic mamlakat from the root malaka, meaning “to own or to rule” (e.g., malek “king” and mālek “owner”). Mamlakat was often used in Persian historiography for territorially defined kingdoms or dynastic realms and its constituent provinces, e.g., mamlakat-e Irān or mamālek-e Irān or mamālek-e maḥrusa-ye Irān “protected kingdom of Iran” (during the Mongol era and thereafter), mamlakat-e Ḵorāsān or Fārs or Kermān (see below). The Arabic terms welāyat and eyālat until recently referred to provinces. The old terms waṭan (Ar.) or mihan (Pers.) were used in classical Persian literature to refer predominantly to a person’s place of birth and habitation. One’s place of birth and residence was considered as the object of one’s love, admiration, and devotion (see Ashraf, 1993, pp. 159-64; 1994. pp. 521-50; Lambton, 1978, pp. 785-90). The term “Iran,” has stood for the kingdom of Iranian dynasties and the homeland of the Iranian people since the mythical foundation of the country by Faridun. Irānšahr (see ĒRĀNŠAHR), a Sasanid concept, conveys the meaning of the kingdom of the rulers of Iran. These territorial conceptions of Iran were, in particular, significant for identification of Iranian people, who were more concerned with their territorial ties, than Arabs, who were primarily identified with their lineage. It is important to note that the term “Iran” constitutes only one of the elements that define Iranian identity in its ethnic, cultural, and territorial totality. This may be seen in such monumental works as Bayhaqi’s History, ʿOnsor-al-Maʿāli’s Qābus-nāma, Neẓām-al-Molk’s Siāsat-nāma, Neẓāmi’s Haft peykar and Ḵosrow o Širin, Hafez’s (q.v.) Divān, and Saʿdi’s Bustān and Golestān. These works, while rarely mentioning “Iran,” present the various aspects of Persian cultural heritage and historical memories, including myths and legends, worldviews and moral values, mores and norms of social behavior, principles of political legitimacy and social relations, as well as imagined genealogical origins of the Iranian people. Yet, the survey of the frequency and pattern of the usage of “Iran” and its derivatives in Persian literature must be taken into account in the context of claims by those authors who base much of their argument on the rarity of the occurrence of the usage of the word “Iran” in Persian literature in contradistinction to its frequent application in modern times, a radical innovation that they attribute to the writings of 18th and 19th century Orientalists who passed this legacy to the Pahlavi state, which in turn bolstered and institutionalized it through legislation in 1935 by changing the official name of the country from Persia to Iran (Vaziri, 1993; Fragner, 1999). These frequencies are driven from the indexes of selected historical writings. In interpreting them, however, caution must be exercised, since the criteria used by various indexers and the precision of their efforts may vary considerably from work to work. They are, nevertheless, suggestive of the pattern of the usage of the terms in each period. To simplify the findings of the survey the frequency of the use of the term “Iran” in each period is presented in terms of the average number of terms appeared in each of the historical works of that era. The remaining part of this section will describe the frequency and pattern of usage of the term “Iran” in Persian literature under the Iranian regional dynasties, during whose rule the pre-modern ethno-national history of Iran was revived and the foundation of Iranian cultural identity was reconfirmed. These same frequencies and patterns of usage in literatures of the Saljuqid, Il-khanid-Timurid, and Safavid eras will be treated in the sections that follow. The usage of the term “Iran” in the early Persian literature. The period between the birth of literary Persian poetry in the late 9th century and the composition of the Šāh-nāma by Ferdowsi in the late 10th century marks the flourishing of the usage of “Iran” in the emerging Persian prose and poetry. A unique feature of this period is the creation of a corpus of Iranian epic literature and romances dealing with pre-Islamic Iran, using the pre-Islamic notion of Iran and its related terms (see Ṣafā, 1984, pp. 160-342). References to Irān and Irānzamin, its myths and legends, its kings and notables (gozinān-e Irān) begin to appear in a number of books of kings, including Masʿudi Marvazi’s Šāh-nāma (ca. 912), Abu Manṣuriδ Šāh-nāma (ca. 960; although we only have fragments in the form of a preface), and Daqiqi’s (q.v.; d. 976) 1,000 lines narrating the reign of Goštasp that were used by Ferdowsi (see Qazvini, 1953, pp. 5-90). It is, however, in Ferdowsi’s Šāh-nāma (d. 1019 or 1025), that the Iranian worldview and its mythological and legendary history, as well as its later factual history (Parthian and Sasanid periods) is presented with utmost eloquence; in it the name “Iran” and its related terms are used 720 times and “Iranians” 350 times. A group of Persian literati, who wrote in Arabic during the formative period of Islamic historiography, began to introduce specifically Persian themes and frequently referred to “Iran” and “Iranian” (or in its Arabicized form, Fors or ʿAjam) in the context of Iranian traditional history. Beginning with the pioneering and influential translation of the Ḵʷadāy-nāmag from Pahlavi into Arabic by Ebn al-Moqaffaʿ (q.v.; d. 757; as well as a number of other translations), Persian literati continued to elaborate on the pre-Islamic traditional history of Iran. Notable among them were Ebn Qotayba’s (q.v.; d. 889) various works, including ʿOyun al-aḵbār, referring on various occasions to the Persian history and cultural heritage; Dinavari (d. 895), who dedicates a large part of his Aḵbār al-ṭewāl to the narratives of pre-Islamic Iran; Ṭabari (d. 923), who devotes a book of his monumental History to similar topics; Ḥamza Eṣfahāni (d. 962), who, with deep pride and passion for Iran (taʿaṣṣob al-fors), dedicates a large part of his Seni moluk al-arż to the narratives of pre-Islamic Iranian kings. Other historical works of the same category include Ebn Meskawayh’s (q.v.; d. 1030) Tajāreb al-omam and Tahḏib al-aḵbār, Ṯaʿālebi’s (d. 1038) Ḡorar aḵbār moluk al-fors, and Biruni’s (d. 1048) Āṯār al-bāq-iya. It was within this tradition that a number of prominent Arab historians too, wrote extensively on Iran’s history, including Maqdesi’s (d. 945) Ketāb al-badʾ wa’l-taʾriḵ, Masʿudi’s (d. 956) Moruj al-ḏahab and Ketāb al-tanbih wa’l-ešrāf, and Yaʿqubi’s (d. 987) Taʾrikò. Mention must also be made of such influential works in Persian as Bal-ʿami’s (d. 962) redaction of Ṭabari’s history, which marks the beginning of Persian historiography, and Gardizi’s (d. 1050) Zayn al-aḵbār, whose concentration on Iran was extensive (for discussion on Persian historiography of this period, see Daniel, 1990, pp. 282-321; and Meisami, 2000, pp. 348-74). On average, on 76 occasions the term Irān and related concepts were used in each of the above historical works (including Ṭabari’s Tārikò with 292 cases, and an average of 55 references without counting his work). The significance of these works lies, not only in their frequent use of the terms Irān and Irānšahr, or Fors and ʿAjam but in the institutionalization in Islamic historiography of the traditional history of Iran as a major chapter in the history of the ancient world. Their narrative of Iran’s ancient history was repeatedly copied and presented in the later periods. As noted, the term “Iran” in these works refers to various aspects of Iran’s traditional history in the pre-Islamic era. Such references, however, helped establish the idea of the territorial and genealogical origin of the Iranian people, which provided the foundation of Iranian cultural identity in the subsequent centuries. Another factor in the survival of Iran’s ethno-national history may be the widespread reading and reciting of the Šāh-nāma by storytellers whose audiences included individuals from all walks of life. The focus of the Persian epic literature and historical writings of this period was mainly on pre-Islamic Iran, referring for the most part to the historical notion of Iran in the pre-Islamic era rather than to the contemporary living reality of Iran after the Islamic conquest. Contemporary notions of “Iran” began to emerge in this period when the pioneers of Persian poetry started to use the term in reference, albeit symbolically, to contemporary events. Such references to the contemporary Iranian kings, kingdoms, rulers, commanders, sages, and lands are found in several divāns of Persian poetry from this period. For example, Rudaki (d. 941), calls a Saffarid governor of Sistān a nobleman of the Sasanid stock and “pride of Iran” (mafḵar-e Irān), which implies a sense of continuity in Iranian identity from the Sasanid to the Samanid era (Tārik-e Sistān, pp. 319-20). Abu Šakur Balḵi (in Āfarin-nāma [947]; cited by Sajjādi, p. 751), refers to the “sage of Iran.” Furthermore, reference to the contemporary conception of “Iran” flourished under the early Ghaznavids. The Ghaznavid transitional phase. During the early Ghaznavid period, which marks the beginnings of Turkic domination, the cultural life and literary tradition of the Samanids continued. The early Ghaznavids were raised as slave soldiers in the Samanid military institution and spent a period of their character formation within the rich cultural ambience of the Persian court (Bosworth, p. 61). It was in this atmosphere that Persian literati invented genealogies to connect the Ghaznavids to the Sasanids. According to a genealogy cited by Juzjāni, Sebüktigin, through six generation from his father, was the descendant of Yazdgerd III’s daughter (see Bosworth, p. 61). This genealogical invention is similar to the efforts by Persians to cast the fourth Shiʿite Imam as the maternal grandson of the last Sasanid king Yazdgerd III by supportive genealogies (see further below). As a result, there are references to “Iran” as a contemporary entity in the poetry of this period. A prominent poet of this period, Farroḵi Sistāni (d. 1030), mentions “Iran” over 30 times in his Divān, referring to Sultan Maḥmud and his sons as šah-e Irān (and Turān) and ḵosrow-e Irān, and also makes references to irānšahr and irānzamin (Divān, ed. Dabirsiāqi, index); ʿOnṣori (d. 1040), refers to the “Iranian king” (šāh-e Irān, ḵosrow-e Irān), “Iranian kingdom\" (kešvar-e Irān), and “Iranian lands” (irānzamin and zamin-e irānšahr; Divān, ed. Dabirsiāqi, Index); Manučehri (d. 1041), refers to “Iran” and “Turān” and ḵosrow-e Irān. References to “Iran” are also found in the divāns of Abu Ḥanifa Eskāfi (d. 1041) as well as in Asadi Ṭusi’s Divān (d. 1073). Asʿad Gorgāni’s Vis o Rāmin (ca. 1072, Index) refers to “Iran” on 25 occasions (for surveys of references to “Iran” in Persian classical poetry, see Sajjādi, pp. 749-59; Matini, pp. 243-68; Šafiʿi Kadkani, pp. 1-26). Two novel developments under Sultan Maḥmud significantly helped the foundation of Persian hegemony. The first was the converting of all chancery records and correspondences from Arabic to Persian by the order of Maḥmud’s first vizier, Abu’l-Ḥasan Esfarāʾeni (q.v.). Although his successor, Aḥmad b. Ḥasan Maymandi (q.v.), restored Arabic, Esfarāʾeni’s practice marked the beginning of the establishment of Persian as the literary language of the chancery in the courts of the Turkish and Mongol dynasties in Iran, Central Asia, Muslim India, and Anatolia in the coming centuries. Furthermore, Sultan Maḥmud’s conquest of India marked the beginning of Persian influence in the subcontinent (see INDIA ii). Although the hierarchical notion of “Turk and Tāzik,” which became prevalent under the Ghaznavids, dealt a blow to the use of the term “Iran,” the increasing hegemony of Persian language helped elevate Iran’s cultural heritage and its expression in the Persian literature of this period. Bayhaqi, for example, identified himself as a “Tāzik,” but used the term very rarely; his matchless History contains a wealth of Persian cultural memories, descriptions of the festivals of nowruz and mehregān, court grandeur and etiquette, as well as the Persian modes of social and political relations. In a telling passage on the occasion of the coronation of the Saljuqid, Sultan Ṭoḡrel, Bayhaqi states that when “the audience hall appeared devoid of all splendor and glitter,” Judge Ṣāʿed addresses the Sultan, “May the lord’s life be long! Take note that this is Sultan Masʿud’s throne that you are sitting on…. Such unforeseeable events do happen and one cannot know what further happenings will emerge from the Unseen.” The Sultan replies, “We are new to this land, and as strangers, unacquainted with the manners and customs of the Tāziks [Persian]” (cited from, History of Bayhaqi, annotated tr. with introd. by C. E. Bosworth and M. Ashtiany, forthcoming). This passage shows how the Ghaznavids were known for their familiarity, as well as sympathy, with Persian customs and how the rising Saljuq sultans were ignorant of Persian cultural heritage. It also signifies how a member of the religious ranks of Persian literati was concerned with the Persian style of court etiquette and ceremony. IRANIAN IDENTITY DURING THE SALJUQIDS Iranian identity underwent a period of complex mutations with mixed consequences under the Saljuqids. In this period, the decline of Persian epic and the less frequent usage of the term “Iran” in Persian poetry and historiography coincided with the flourishing of Persian literature and spread of Persian hegemony in Islamic societies. Turkic dynasties were for the most part military states bent on war and conquest and imposed an exogenous rule over their Persian subjects. However, the Persian literati took control over many organs of the state administration and from such positions of influence reintroduced their Persian cultural heritage. With the Turkic rise to power, the ‘sword’ and the ‘pen,’ which had been reunified in the Persian hands during the Iranian regional dynasties, were once again separated. The sword and the pen symbolically represented two pillars of the sovereignty of the ruling classes: “military class” and “administrative class” respectively (it should be noted here that the military contingents of Persian origin continued to function, but as a secondary force on command). Thus, the rise of the Turkic slaves and tribes to power in the 11th-12th centuries led to a new binary division of “Turk and Tāzik/Tājik” and less frequent usage of “Iran” in Persian historical and literary works of this period (for a useful survey of the usage of Tāzik/Tājik in Persian literature, see Dabirsiāqi, 1991). The long period of Turkish rule in Iran could itself be divided into a number of distinct periods in terms of Iranian identity: the Ghaznavid transitional period with the continuity of Samanid tradition (see above); the Saljuq period, marking a complex situation for Iranian identity; the Mongol and Timurid phase, during which the name “Iran” was used for the dynastic realm and a pre-modern ethno-national history of Iranian dynasties was arranged; and the period from the Safavids to the end of the Qajars, when a clear Iranian-Shiʿite identity, based on an amalgamation of Turk and Fārs elements, emerged. It is interesting to note that the Persian literati invented complete genealogies to connect both the first and the last Turkic dynasties that ruled Iran to the pre-Islamic dynasties: the Ghaznavids and the Qajars (see below). The complex phase under the Saljuqs. Although the great Saljuqs reunified Iran for the first time since the Arab conquest of Persia, the use of the term “Iran” to denote the dynastic realm was not encouraged. This can be attributed to further Islamization of Iranian society and institutionalization of the Islamic state with a universalistic outlook. In fact, the Saljuqs founded a religio-political system by combining the temporal authority of the sultan with the symbolic religious authority of the caliph. Neẓām-al-Molk played a pivotal role in the establishment of Islamic orthodoxy and universalism as an integral part of the Saljuqid state (Bondāri Eṣfahāni, pp. 66-67). The Neżāmiya schools, which were created at his behest, contributed to the interconnection between the state and religious establishments and helped strengthen the status of civil administration and men of the pen vis-à-vis the men of the sword in the Islamic state. The literati of Persian origin, who were trained in both Persian literary tradition and Islamic law at these schools, continued to serve as bureaucratic agents in various Islamic governments in the ensuing centuries and were responsible for spreading the Persian language and culture throughout the Islamic world (see also Klausner, 1973; Lambton, 1980, pp. 203-82). There was a decline in the usage of “Iran” in Persian historiography (see, Ṣafā, 1984, pp. 154-59; 1977, pp. 126-44, 158-60), with only few references, made to “Iran” or even “Tāzik” in the works of such historians of this period as Bondāri Eṣfahāni’s (d. 1100) Tāriḵ-e selsela-ye Saljuqi, and Nasavi’s (d. 1253) Sirat-e Jalāl-al-Din Minkoberni. The latter (pp. 47, 75) refers to “Iran” on two occasions: the first regarding Goštāsp (q.v.), king of Iran, and the second regarding Neẓām-al-Molk, the grand vizier (dastur) of Iran and Turān. Esfazāri’s Rawżāt al-jannāt fi awṣāf madinat al-Herāt (p. 162) also has one reference to Neẓām-al-Molk as the grand vizier of mamālek-e Irān. The decline of Persian epic literature and its eventual replacement by Islamic epics or a synthesis of Iranian and Islamic myths and legends must be considered as another distinct feature of this period. This synthesis pre-figures post-Mongol and Safavid developments. Thus, although the ʿAli-nāma contains both an implicit and explicit rejection of purely Iranian epics, the genre of pand-nāma anthologies, which quoted didactic lines from the Šāh-nāma side by side with moral dicta from Imam ʿAli, are emblematic of this forthcoming fusion. The decline in the number of references to “Iran” in this period is also evident in Persian poetry, as seen in the divāns of Sanāʾi and Anvari. An illustration of the zealous, anti-Iranian Islamic attitude may be seen in the poems of Amir-Moʿezzi (d. 1147) and Sayf-al-Din Farḡāni (q.v.; d. early 14th century). Unaware of the meaning and cultural significance of myths and legends, Amir-Moʿezzi accuses Ferdowsi of lying and wild exaggerations in his treatment of Rostam (Divān-e Amir Moʿezzi, p. 286). By contrast, the poet Saʿdi, quite conscious of the social functions of myths, wrote: “The exploits of the champion Rostam and the brazen-bodied Esfandiār are narrated in fable in order to make rulers and kings realize that this world itself is a memento and a legacy derived from many people from the past” (Kolliyāt, p. 724). Farḡāni, went so far, on the other hand, as to say that the soil and water of Iran are not suitable for a Muslim’s prayer, because the Sasanid kings had rendered it najess, i.e., ritually impure (Divān, p. 31). Yet, even in this period, one finds works of Persian epic, such as Irānšāh’s Kuš-nāma and Bahman-nāma (ca. 1117), that make frequent references to “Iran,” nearly 160 times in the former case and over 100 times in the latter (see Matini, p. 259). “Iran” is also mentioned in such important historical works as Ebn Esfandiār’s (d. 1217, q.v.) Tariḵ-e Ṭabarestān, referring to “Iran” on six occasions and to Tāzik on 11 occasions. Mojmal al-tawāriḵ wa’l-qeṣasá (ca. 1126), refers to “Iran” on 29 occasions; Moḥamamd b. ʿAli Rāvandi’s (d. 1238) Rātḥat al-ṣodur mentions ʿAjam in 17 cases; and Ebn Balḵi’s Fārs-nāma (early 12th century) also refers to pre-Islamic Iran, its sovereigns, and foundation of cities on various occasions. Although overt references to “Iran” are relatively rare in this period, abundant mention of its manifestations can be seen in Persian literature. ʿOnsor-al-Maʿāli, well versed in Persian cultural heritage, authored Qābus-nāma, a rare handbook of cultural values and norms of social behavior in almost all major aspects of Persian everyday life. There is, however, no mention of “Iran” or “Tāzik” in this book, making merely six references to “ʿAjam” instead. Neżām-al-Molk (d. 1092) in his influential work Siāsat-nāma simply refers to Persians as Tāziks, while making numerous references to Persian political and cultural heritage in narrating anecdotes and collective memories relating to Iran. In his collection of ‘advices’ from 75 kings, prophets, caliphs, and sages, Ẓahiri Samarqandi presents advices of 38 Iranian mythological, legendary, and historical figures from Jamšid to Sultan Sanjar (mostly from pre-Islamic times), 30 Arab caliphs, and seven Greek, Indian, and Chinese figures. Considering Jamšid as the founder of civilization, he begins the work with a long treatment of his contributions and advices. Similarly, Saʿdi and Hafez—though of later period—who make few references to “Iran” or “ʿAjam” or “Tāzik” in their prose or poetry make many references to the Iranian repertoire of myths and legends as well as Persian ideas, values, mores, and modes of conduct. In the same vein, Neẓāmi, while rarely using the term “Iran,” eternalizes the romances of pre-Islamic Iran in his Ḵamsa (five maṯnavis). It was also in the Saljuq era that Persian established itself as a literary language, not only on a par with Arabic, but more important than Arabic in certain genres, including mystical poetry (for the role of mystical literature in reconstruction of Iranian ethnic identity, see Meskoob, 1992). Furthermore, it was in this period that Persian, as the first lingua franca, began to spread in medieval Islamic civilization as a trans-regional means of communication of chancery and literati. In the course of time, ‘Perian hegemony’ established itself in the Ottoman empire, Central Asia, the Mughal empire in India, and South-East Asia (for the notion of “Persian hegemony,” see i, above). THE IDEA OF “IRAN” UNDER THE MONGOLS AND TIMURIDS The fall of the Abbasid Caliphate, the symbolic guardians of Islamic universalism, in the 13th century, accompanied by a shift from religious orthodoxy to relative religious tolerance and the unification of the Iranian plateau under the Il-khanids, signaled a new era in the history of Iranian identity. These developments provided the Persian literati with a new opportunity to rearrange the ethno-national history of Iran and reinstate—for the first time since the fall of the Sasanid empire—the usage of Iran and Irānzamin as appellation for their dynastic realm. Also contributing to the new concept of Iran, its global location, and its place in history was the emergence of genuinely “universal” and “world” histories with divisions into different regions describing the mores and manners of the different civilizations, such as the Indians or the Franks (Europeans). It is in this vein that Rašid-al-Din’s Jāmeʿ al-tawāriḵ is often referred to as the first “world history,” reflecting the Mongol conception of universal rule and world domination. This new historical outlook was prompted by the Mongols’ sweeping advances, east and west, into Europe and elsewhere, combined with their own innate curiosity about different religions. The prominent historians of this period frequently referred to Iran and Irānzamin both as historical notions and as contemporaneous entities. Rašid-al-Din Fażl-Allāh (d. 1318) refers repeatedly to “Iran” in his monumental work Jāmeʿ al-tawārik, as well as in his Tāriḵ-e mobārak-e Ḡāzāni and Sawāneḥ al-afkār. He also makes a number of references to the country of Iran (kešvar-e Iran). This appears to be one of the first instances of the usage of the concept of country (kešvar) to denote the contemporary kingdom of Iran. On another occasion, he refers to the borders of Iran as extending from the Āmuya river to the Jhelum river in northern India (Āb-e Javn) in the east, and from Byzantium (Rum) to Egypt in the west (pp. 46, 73, 147). Other references to Iran include “Peoples of Iran” (ahāli-e or ḵalāyeq-e Irānzamin), “provinces of Iran” (mamālek-e Irānzamin), “Khan of Irānzamin,” and “sovereigns of Iran” (moluk-e Iran). Influenced by the new conception of the “world,” Rašid-al-Din, like many other historians and geographers, mentions Iran, Turān, Farang, Egypt and Morocco (Maḡreb), Byzantium (Rum), India, and China in referring to the kingdoms of the time, signifying a distinct identity for Iran among major countries of the world (for a pioneering survey of resurgence of the use of the term “Iran” during the Mongol period, see Krawulski, 1978, pp. 11-17). Other historical works, including Banākati’s (q.v.; d. 1330) Tāriḵ-e Banākati, Šabānkāraʾi’s Majmaʿ al-ansāb (1333), Naḵjavāni’s (d. 1336) Dastūr al-kāteb, Ḥamd-Allāh Mostawfi’s (d. 1349) Tāriḵ-e gozida; and ʿAbd-al-Razzāq Samarqandi’s (d. 1371) Maṭlaʿ-e saʿdayn wa majmaʿ-e baḥrayn make frequent references to Iran and its related terms. Describing a battle in which Sultan Üljeytu barely defeats his adversaries, Samarqandi exclaims that “if it were not due to God’s benevolence nothing would have remained of the kingdom of Iran but name” (p. 43); On another occasion he outlines the borders of the Abu Saʿidi kingdom from Oxus to Euphrates and underlines that “Irānšahr consists of the cities lying between the two borders” (p. 121). Other historical works that make numerous references to “Iran” include Ḥāfeẓ-e Abru’s (d. 1417) Zobdat al-tawārikò and Joḡrāfiā, Tāj-al-Din Ḥasan Yazdi’s (d. 1453) Jāmeʿ al-tawāriḵ-e Ḥasani, and Mir Moḥammad b. Sayyed Borhān-al-Din Ḵᵛāvand-šāh’s (Mirḵᵛānd; d. 1497), Rawżat al-ṣafā. Finally, it is noteworthy that, in a surviving collection of chancery correspondence between rulers of Iran and neighboring kingdoms from the early Timurid to the early Safavid periods, 19 references can be found to the contemporary notions of Iran, Irānzamin, kešvar-e Irān (country of Iran, p. 690), šāhanšāh-e Irān (king of kings of Iran), aḥwāl-e Irān (conditions of Iran), moluk-e Irān (rulers of Iran), mamālek-e Irān (provinces of Iran), šahriār-e diār-e ʿAjam (the ruler of Iran), sepahsālār-e Irān (military commander of Iran), and Irān o Turān (see Navāʾi, 1977, Index). On average, on 42 occasions the term Iran and related concepts were used in each of the above historical works of this period, referring to both pre-Islamic and Islamic eras. Reconstruction of pre-modern national history. The significance of the historiography and historical geography of this era is not limited to the frequent usage of “Iran” and related terms or even the reinstatement of the term Irānzamin. It extends to the reconstruction of new conception of Iran’s “pre-modern ehtno-national history” in terms of a continuum of dynastic histories from the primordial mythological era to the Mongol period. This mode of presentation of Iran’s history, linking the traditional history of Iran, as reconstructed by the Sasanid literati, to the early Safavid period was a novel phenomenon. This sequence of the dynastic history of Irānzamin was constructed for the first time by Qāżi Nāṣer-al-Din ʿOmar Bayżāwi (q.v.; d. 1316) in his concise (95 pages), yet significant and influential, history of Iran, Neẓām al-tawārikò (The arrangement of history). Bayżāwi was a prominent figure in the religious wing of the Persian literati, who served as the chief justice (qāżi al-qożāt) of Fārs province in the early Il-khanid era and made a number of well-known contributions in Arabic to Islamic jurisprudence, Islamic philosophy, and Arabic grammar. His only work in Persian was his arrangement of the ethno-national history of Iran. In his own words, “I have connected the sequence of governors and kings of Iran—which extends from the Euphrates to the Oxus, or rather from the Arab lands to the borders of Khojand—from Adam to the present day. I have divided it into four parts and written it in Persian so that its benefits might be more widespread” (tr. in Melville, p. 76). As Charles Melville (p. 70) has suggested, Bayżāwi’s rearrangement of Iran’s history from ancient times to the Mongol era “had a rather clear political agenda” and that “he was supported by people at the highest level of the court.” Although a number of later historians, including Rašid-al-Din and Banākati, frequently cited Neẓām al-tawārik and adopted its reordering of Iran’s history, it appears that Bayżāwi’s rearrangement of Iran’s ethno-national history into “four periods” was followed in a more systematic and substantively expanded version by Ḥamd-Allāh Mostawfi (q.v.; d. 1349) in his influential work Tāriḵ-e gozida. Mostawfi elaborates on the dynasties that ruled Iran in four sections (bābs): first, the pre-Islamic dynasties of the Pišdādids, the Kayānids, the Moluk al-ṭawāyef (Arsacids), and the Sasanids; second, the Umayyad rule in Iran; third, the Abbasid rule in Iran; and fourth, the dynasties that ruled Iran since the early Islamic era. These dynasties were: the Saffarids and the Samanids, who ruled a part of Iran; the Ghaznavids, who ruled most of Iran in their initial 30 years; the Ghurids; the Daylamites and the Buyids; the Saljuqs, some of whom ruled over all of Iran and some over only parts of Iran; the Ḵʷārazmšāhs; the Atābakān (q.v.) of Fārs and Syria; the Ismāʿilis of Iran and Egypt; the Qarāḵatāys of Ker-mān; the Atābakān of Lorestān; and, finally, the Mongol dynasty. As Table 1 illustrates, Bayżāwi devotes over three-fourths of his work to kings of Persia, whereas Mostawfi allocates only one-half of his history to them. It is important to note that, although Mostawfi devotes a larger portion of his history to the Umayyad and Abbasid caliphs, he consciously covers them in terms of their “rule in Iran” and not in the world of Islam in general: moddat-e molkešān be Irān (p. 10). A unique feature of the contributions of Bayżāwi and Mostawfi is their exclusive focus on Iran’s history from the creation of man and society in Iran to the Mongol era, which sets their work apart from Jovayni’s Jahāngošāy, exclusively a history of the Mongols, or Rašid-al-Din’s Jāmeʿ al-tawārikò, a comprehensive world history from its beginning through the Mongol era. The influence and popularity of both Bayżāwi’s and Mostawfi’s rearrangement of the history of Iran is indicated by the large number of surviving manuscripts of their works from the 13th to the 19th centuries, 58 and 95 respectively (compared to other popular works such as Banākati’s with 31, Juzjāni’s with 23, and Šabānkāraʾi’s with 13 surviving manuscripts). Of Bayżāwi’s work, 27 copies were produced in the Safavid period and 14 during the Qajar era (see Melville, Tables 1 and 2, pp. 73-74). It seems plausible, therefore, that a proportionately large number of manuscripts of Mostawfi’s work may also have been produced during the Safavid and Qajar periods. Indeed, Mostawfi’s influence seems to have surpassed that of Bayżāwi’s, as he is cited in later historical works more frequently. For example, Mirḵᵛānd in Tāriḵ-e rawżat al-sÂafā refers to Mostawfi on 16 occasions and to Bayżāwi in only 8 cases, and Ḵᵛāndamir in Ḥabib al-siar refers to Mostawfi on 56 occasions and to Bayżāwi on only 3 occasions. It was through the popularity of these works that the new, fourfold paradigm of Iran’s history, which displays a more ethno-nationalistic spirit, enjoyed a prolonged success in Persian historiography in the ensuing centuries. Another important feature of this mode of reconstruction of the dynastic history of Iran is a clear geographical awareness of Iran or Irānzamin both in its totality and its constituent parts, combining the historical depth of the idea of “Iran” with its geographical breadth. Mostawfi’s significant contribution to the pre-modern “ethno-national history of Iran” is supplemented by his geography, Nozhat al-qolub. The latter work’s importance derives from its treatment of the contemporary geographical notion of Iran, as well as its boundaries and provinces. Prefacing his work with a description of the two holy sites of Mecca and Medina, outside of Iran’s boundaries, Mostawfi begins his treatment of Iran by discussing different views on the foundation of Iran by Iraj (q.v.) and its place in the world’s seven climes. He suggests that all commentators (Greeks, Indians, and Persians) agree that Iran, located at the center of the inhabited world, is its best part, harking back to the old Sasanid notion of Irānšahr. According to Mostawfi, the boundaries of Irānzamin stretch from the Sind river (in India) to Ḵᵛārazm and Transoxania in the east to Byzantium and Syria in the west. Being aware of the depth and breadth of the historical geography of Iran, Mostawfi reiterates that he is treating only those outer lands that are located on the frontiers of the kingdom of Iran, although “some, at times, have been under the sway of the sovereigns of Iran, and even in these parts some cities have been in fact founded by the sovereigns of Iran” (tr. Le Strange, pp. 23-24). Mostawfi describes the provinces of Iran in 20 chapters, beginning with Iraq (ʿErāq-e Arab) or “the heart of Irānšahr,” and ʿErāq-e ʿAjam (western provinces), followed by Arrān and Muḡān, Šervān, Georgia, Byzantium, Armenia, Rabiʿa, Kurdistan, Khuzestan, Fārs and the Persian Gulf, Šabānkāra, Kermān, Mokrān and Hormuz, the province between Kermān and Qohestān (present day Baluchistan), Nimruz, Khorasan, Māzandarān, Qumes and Ṭabarestān, and finally, Jilānāt (Gilan). This mode of conceptualizing Iran’s history and geography has been followed by other historians since the 13th century. THE “IRANIAN-SHIʿITE” IDENTITY UNDER THE SAFAVIDS Iran regained its political unity and was given a new distinct religious identity under the Safavids. Shiʿism became the official state religion and henceforth played an important role in the reconstruction of a new ethno-religious identity for the Iranian people. Furthermore, the rise of the Safavid empire coincided with the rise of the Ottoman empire in West Asia and North Africa, the Mughal empire in India, and the Uzbek empire in Central Asia, all adhering to Sunnite Islam. The formation of these political entities helped create a distinct Iranian-Shiʿite political identity among these polities. It also helped to expand the hegemony of Persian language in much of the Islamic world. Persian literature was produced from Anatolia to Central Asia and the Indian subcontinent (see Golčin-Maʿāni, Bā kārvān-e Hend). Under the Safavids, a number of important measures were taken to blend religious and ethno-national traditions, while closely following the historiography of the Mongol-Timurid era (for a survey of Safavid historiography and its connection with Timurids, see Quinn, 2000, pp. 28, 49-50, 52). “Iran” in Safavid historiography. Ḡiāṯ-al-Din Ḵᵛānda-mir (d. 1524), the first prominent Safavid historian, was one of the last historians of the Il-khanid-Timurid era and the grandson of Mir Moḥamamd Mirḵᵛānd, author of the influential history, Rawżat al-sÂafā. In preparing his general history, Ḥabib al-siar fi aḵbār afrād al-bašar, Ḵᵛāndamir followed the style of Rawżat al-sÂafā and that of such popular historical works as Neẓām al-tawārikò and Tāriḵ-e gozida (see above). The frequency of the usage of Iran, Irānzamin and related terms in the three volumes of Ḥabib al-siar (completed in 1524) reveals the evolution in the usage of these terms in the Islamic era. The frequency is relatively high in volume I, with 28 references to events of the pre-Islamic period; it drops sharply to 12 in volume II, treating the history of the Islamic period up to the Mongol era; and it leaps to 69 references in volume III, dealing with the Il-khanid-Timurid, and early Safavid periods. Other representative works of this period also make frequent references to “Iran,” including ʿĀlamārā-ye Šāh Esmāʿil, ʿĀlamārā-ye Šah Ṭahmāsp, Ḥasan Beg Rumlu’s (d. 1577) Aḥsan al-tawāriḵ, Ebn Karbalāʾi’s (d. 1589) Rawżāt al-jenān, Malekšāh Ḥosayn Sistāni’s (d. 1619) Eḥyāʾ al-moluk, Mollā ʿAb-al-Nabi Faḵr-al-Zamāni’s Taḏkera-ye meyḵāna (1619); Eskander Beg Rumlu’s (d. 1629) Aḥsan al-tawāriḵ; Wāleh Eṣfahāni’s (d. 1648) Ḵold-e barin, Naṣiri’s (d. 1698) Dastur-e šahriārān. Finally, Moḥammad Mofid Bāfqi (d. 1679), in addition to making numerous references to “Iran” and “ʿAjam” in his Jāmeʿ-e Mofidi (q.v.), refers to distinct borders of Iran and its neighbors, India, Turān, and Byzantium as well as the influx of people from those lands to Iran. In a number of cases, he describes the nostalgia of those Iranians who migrated to India but were later compelled to return by their love for their homeland (ḥobb al-waṭan; see below). He makes a number of insightful comments about Iranian identity and various features of the lands of Iran in his historical geography of Iran, Moḵtaṣar-e Mofid. Adopting the model of Mostawfi’s Nozhat al-qolub, he makes some 20 references to Iran, Irānzamin, and Irānšahr, as well as the borders of Iran’s territory, in the introduction to his work. He makes numerous references, furthermore, to Persian mythological and legendary figures in the traditional history of Iran as founders of a large number of cities in Yazd, Iraq, Fārs, Azerbaijan, and other parts of Iran. Finally, he provides readers with a useful list of Iranian islands in the Persian Gulf and the Sea of Oman. On average, on 62 occasions the term Iran and related concepts were used in each of the above historical works of the Safavid era. It is also noteworthy that, from the beginnings of relations between Iran and the West in this period, the Iranian officials tended to consider their distinctive culture and civilization to be unique and superior to all others, including the Western countries (for a survey of the superiority trait among Iranians of the Safavid era, see Matthee, 1998). Religion and ethno-national identity. Contrary to the views of those who deny the role of religion in the formation of ethno-national identities, it may be noted that in most European societies local churches played an important part in creating and maintaining a sense of national identity, particularly at times of social and political crisis. Eric Hobsbawm argues that, although religion may appear as a rival to nationalism in attracting people’s loyalties, in actual fact it has acted as a catalyst for nationalism both in pre-modern and modern times. As examples of this process he cites the contributions made by Zoroastrianism in the formation of the Iranian ethno-national identification in the Sasanid era and the role played by Shiʿism at the time of the Safavids (Hobsbawm, pp. 69, 137). The evidence pointing to the symbiosis of Persian and Shiʿite traditions includes the use of combined Shiʿite and Iranian titles by the Safavid shahs, the dissemination of the genealogy for the Imams as maternal descendants of the last Sasanid king, invention of the tradition of ḥobb al-waṭan mena’l-imān, and dissemination of various traditions attributed to the Imams providing religious legitimacy to the observance of the Persian New Year and its accompanying rites. The Safavid kings called themselves, among other appellations, the “dog of the shrine of ʿAli” (kalb-e āstān-e ʿAli), while assuming the title of Šāhanšāh (the king of kings) of Iran. It must be remembered that the title of the king of Iran was also used by Āq Quyunlu rulers (the direct predecessors of the Safavids) who presented themselves as successors to the glorious mythical kings of ancient Persia (Faridun, Jamšid, and Kaykāvus). Even Ottoman sultans, when addressing the Āq Quyunlu and Safavid kings, used such titles as the “king of Iranian lands” or the “sultan of the lands of Iran” or “the king of kings of Iran, the lord of the Persians” or the “holders of the glory of Jamšid and the vision of Faridun and the wisdom of Dārā.” They addressed Shah Esmaʿil as: “the king of Persian lands and the heir to Jamšid and Kay-ḵosrow” (Navāʾi, pp. 578, 700-702, 707). During Shah ʿAbbās’s reign (q.v.) the transformation is complete and Shiʿite Iran comes to face the two adjacent Sunni powers: the Ottoman Empire to the west and the Kingdom of Uzbeks to the east. The maternal Iranian origin of the Imams. With the spread of Shiʿism in Iran, the idea of the maternal linkage of the Imams with Sasanid stock (real or imagined) was disseminated. The Persian Shiʿites are proud of the lineage of the Imams as maternal descendants of Yazdegerd III, the last Sasanid king. According to tradition, the fourth Shiʿite Imam (ʿAli b. Ḥosayn, Ḥażrat-e Sajjād), is reported to have said: “I am proud to descend from the lineage of my father, Imam Ḥosayn, coming from Qorayš, the noblest of Arab tribes, as I am of the lineage of my mother, princess Šahrbānu, descended from Persian stock, whom the Prophet himself called the noblest of non-Arab peoples” (Dehḵodā, III, p. 1537; Qomi, p. 196; Ebn al-Balḵi, p. 4). The marriage of the Persian princess with the third Imam has been described as having taken place at a dramatic audience of ʿOmar, the second caliph, at which a princess, the daughter of Yazdegerd III, is presented among the booties of the Arab army. At the critical moment when ʿOmar orders the selling of the princess into the slave market, Imam ʿAli appears on the scene and opposes the verdict on the grounds of a Prophetic tradition that forbids “the sale of the royal offspring in Islam.” When Imam ʿAli prevails, he leaves her to the patronage of Salmān Fārsi (a legendary Persian companion of the Prophet) to arrange for her marriage to a man of her choice. Šahrbānu chooses to marry Imam Ḥosayn and gives birth to the fourth Shiʿite Imam. In this imaginary narrative, all Imams from the fourth to the twelfth (the Mahdi, the Lord of the Age) are maternal descendents of the last Sasanid king (see, ʿOnṣor-al-Ma ʿāli, Qābus-nāma, pp. 137-38). Considering that the Safavids had also invented a genealogy linking their lineage to the Imams, belief in this narrative also signifies the Persian genealogical roots of the Safavids. The love of homeland. On a number of occasions in the Safavid period—apparently for the first time—the notion of waṭan and the love for it were extended from the love of birthplace and residence to Iran. Šafiʿi Kadkani argues, for example, that the Hadith of ḥobb al-waṭan mena’l-imān might have been invented by Persians, who were more concerned with territorial ties, than Arabs, who were primarily identified with their lineage. Šafiʿi argues that Jāḥeẓ did not refer to the tradition in his comprehensive treatment of the subject, al-Ḥanin ela’l-awṭān; it is rarely found in Sunnite Hadith collections; and the main references to it could be found in Moḥammad Bāqer Majlesi’s Beḥār al-anwār and Shaikh ʿAbbās Qomi’s Safinat al-beḥār (Šafiʿi Kadkani, p. 12). Moḥammad Mofid Bāfqi, a contemporary of Majlesi, in his Jāmeʿ-e Mofidi reports that when a prominent statesman, Mirzā Moḥammad Amin, had been serving as the vizier of the Qotbshahids of Deccan (q.v), he became nostalgic and returned to Iran for the love of his homeland (ḥobb-e waṭan and ārezu-ye āmadan-e be Irān). Other examples include a certain Mirzā Esḥāq Beg and Captain Āqā Aḥmad, who migrated to India and later returned to Iran, or that of Mofid himself, who decided to return to Iran from India in accordance with the Hadith of ḥobb al-waṭan mena’l-imān, in spite of the comfort and hospitality extended to him in Šāh Jahānābād (Jāmeʿ … , III, 1, pp. 92, 453, 475, 804). Still another case is the poet, Nawʿi Ḵabušāni (d. 1610), who, becoming nostalgic during his long residence in the court of the Indian king, Akbar, laments in a moving poem that “my tears flow to cleanse the land of Iran” (cited in Šafiʿ Kadkani, p. 5). Commemorations of Nowruz and ʿĀšurā. Commemorations of historic events in pre-modern societies served as the central vehicle for connecting collective memory with ethnic or ethno-national identification. Placing commemorations of seminal cultural events in their historical setting is an indication that the two distinct yet related ethno-national and religious events, Nowruz and ʿĀšurā (celebrations of New Year’s day for 13 days and the martyrdom of Imam Ḥosayn, the third Shiʿite Imam, for 10 days), are of utmost significance in the reconstruction of Iranian identity under the Safavids. Initiated in Baghdad in the year 963 by order of the Buyid ruler, Moʿezz-al-Dawla, the commemoration of ʿĀšurā (q.v.) was added to the celebrations of Nowruz and Mehragān. When Āšurā coincided with the other two celebrations, the ethno-national festivals were observed on the next day; this scenario occurred in the year 398/1008, when Āšurā coincided with Mehragān (see Faqihi, pp. 466-67). These dual commemorations became well established under the Safavids and together laid the foundations for the “Iranian-Shiʿite” identity for over 500 years. The commemoration of the martyrdom of Imam Ḥosayn has many similarities to that of the martyrdom of Siāvuš (Sug-e Siāvuš) in pre-Islamic Persian mythology, which was commemorated in Soghdiana and Chorasmia until the early Islamic era and in some villages in Kuhgiluya even until recent times. Given that the two rites display a number of basic common features, some writers have suggested that ʿAšurā may have gradually substituted the mourning for Siāvuš over time (see Meskoob, Sug-e Siāvuš, pp. 80-89). In fact, the similarities of the two commemorations may partially explain the pervasive popularity of Āšurā among Persians. As Yarshater (1979, pp. 88-94) concludes in his comparison of the two rituals: “The martyrdom of Hussein and his kin found a ready ground in Persian tradition in order to develop into an inspiring and elaborate mourning drama. It inherited the major feature of a long-standing practice which had deep roots in the Persian soul.” While Āšurā inherited basic features of the ritual of Siāvuš, Nowruz found religious legitimization by invention of a number of traditions attributed to Shiʿite Imams from the Buyid to the Safavid periods. The historical narratives concerning the celebration of Nowruz indicate that, despite the objection of zealous Islamic universalists, Persians at large continued to celebrate Nowruz from the advent of Islam to the present time. The length, the joyful collective mood, and the grandeur of Nowruz celebrations in Iran and many parts of Central Asia is unparalleled in comparison to all of the religious and ethno-national festivals in other Islamic societies (see ČAHĀRŠANBASURI; HAFTSIN; NOWRUZ ii. ISLAMIC PERIOD). The contested, yet mutually supportive nature of the two distinct commemorations of Nowruz and ʿĀšurā has made observance of the Persian New Year the subject of longstanding controversy in Shʿite jurisprudence. This controversy between those who espouse Nowruz’s legitimacy and those who condemn it as a pagan and un-Islamic practice in Iran may be traced to the Buyid period. When Shiʿism was formally declared the state religion under the Safavids and the observance of both Nowruz and ʿĀšurā formed the two major wings of state festivals, a revised and expanded version of the book on Nowruz and the Persian calendar was prepared and incorporated (as a volume of some 90 pages in a set of 110 volumes) into the encyclopedic collection of Shiʿite traditions, Behār al-anwār by Mollā Moḥammd Bāqer Majlesi, the major religious figure in the Safavid state. Of various traditions presented in Behār al-anwār on the celebration of Nowruz, two stand out as of central importance: one attributed to Imam Jaʿfar al-Ṣādeq (q.v.), sanctifying the celebration, and the other attributed to Imam Musā al-Kāẓem, condemning it as un-Islamic. Behār narrates the story of a certain Moʿallā b. Ḵonays, who pays a visit to Imam Ṣādeq on Nowruz. Explaining the significance of Nowruz, as “the day of the primal covenant with mankind, the day of the first rising of the sun, and the day of various other events in the lives of the prophets concluding with the defeat of the antichrist Dajjāl by the Qāʾem,” the Imam maintains that it is “one of our days [i.e., holy days] and one of the days of our Shiʿa, which the Persians have kept, although you [presumably the Arabs] have tried t o suppress it” (Majlesi, Behār al-anwār LIX, p. 92, as tr. and cited by Walbridge, p. 83). The adversaries of Nowruz rely on a tradition attributed to Imam Musā al-Kāẓem, when the Caliph al-Manṣur called upon him regarding the legitimacy of the observance of Nowruz, and he replied: “I have examined the traditions of my grandfather, the Messenger of God, and found nothing about this holiday. It is a Persian custom that Islam has destroyed” (Behār, loc. cit., as tr. and cited by Walbridge, p. 83). While suggesting that this tradition has been frequently attributed to Imam al-Ṣādeq in numerous sources, Majlesi, in a scholarly manner, leaves the door open for the readers to decide the issue for themselves. Also of importance in the controversy is the fact that, since the time of Shaikh al-Ṭāʾefa Ṭusi, one of the founding fathers of Shʿite law in the 11th century, the obligatory fast and prayer of Nowruz has become a part of Shiʿite law, but the date of Nowruz has been the subject of continued controversy. Furthermore, Shaikh ʿAbbās Qomi, in his influential modern collection of Shiʿite prayers, Mafātiḥ al-jenān, talks in support of the tradition attributed to Imam al-Ṣādeq to sanctify the celebration of Nowruz: “On the day of Nowruz wash [perform ablution] and dress in your cleanest clothes …” (as cited by Walbridge, pp. 89-90). The pervasive celebration of Nowruz among people from all walks of life may also be observed by comparing it to the other main Islamic festivals, with the exception of Āšura. The celebration of Nowruz surpasses the two main Islamic festivals: the festival of fast-breaking (ʿId-e Feṭr), during the holiday that follows the completion of the holy month of fasting (Ramażān), and the festival of sacrifice (ʿId-e Qorbān or al-Ażḥā). The significance of Nowruz is further indicated by its special place in the chronicles of Safavid historians, featuring detailed descriptions of the grandeur of Nowruz festivities, even when it coincided with ʿĀšurā. Nowruz festivities on 21 March 1611 occurred on Friday, 6 Mo-ḥarram 1020, the day on which Shiʿites commemorate the martyrdom of Imam Ḥosayn. Shah ʿAbbās honored both days, mourning on the day of ʿĀšurā and celebrating Nowruz on the following day. The grandeur of the celebration of Nowruz 1611 is well illustrated in the chronicle Āla-mārā-ye ʿAbbāsi: “The Shah then ordered a great feast to be prepared in the Bāḡ-e Naqš-e Jahān to which all classes of society were invited. … Each group was allotted its own particular place in the park, and gold tents and canopies of silk and Chinese brocade were set up. Booths, embellished in curious remarkable ways and illuminated with lamps, were erected in front of each group. Pages plied the assembled gathering with cheering draughts, and the merrymaking went on for several days” (tr. Savory, 1978, p. 1037). CONCLUSION Transcending local, regional, as well as kinship and tribal horizons, a relatively coherent historical and cultural conception of Iranian identity was developed in the long pre-modern history of Iran. The identity of Iranians was largely drawn from their territorial ties. They were identified, for the most part, with their places of birth or residence, which were in turn located in the lands of Iran or kingdom of Iran (irānšahr, irānzamin, molk-e Irān, mamlekat-e Irān, kešvar-e Irān). They assumed that their ties to the historical conception of the lands of Iran were also manifestations of their common imagined ancestry, deeply rooted in Persian mythologies and traditional history. Even the Persianized ruling Turkic and Mongol men of the sword presented themselves as the heirs of Persian kings and amirs in a continuum from primordial times to the end of the Qajar period, and as such they were considered to be Iranian. Belief in Iran’s cultural distinctiveness, commemoration of the national festival of Nowruz, dissemination of the idea of “Iran” through naqqāli and Šāh-nāma ḵᵛāni to the masses, and the popularity of Persian poetry among people from all walks of life continued to serve as the foundation of Iranian cultural identity in modern times. It is interesting to note that the glorification of pre-Islamic Iranian history and culture recurred in the Safavid period, with many imaginative linguistic inventions, with the Āḏar Keyvāni religious and literary movement (q.v.), a pseudo-Zoroastrian sect (see also DABESTĀN-E MAḎĀHEB; DASĀTIR; for its influence during the 19th century, see Tavakoli-Targhi, 2001, pp. 86-95). Following this movement in the 19th century, a Qajar prince, Jalāl-al-Din Mirzā, identifying himself as being of Persian stock, prepared the first textbook of Iran’s pre-modern ethno-national history from the time of creation to the mid-19th century. It was within this broad framework of historical awareness and cultural consciousness that Iranian identity entered the age of nationalism of the 19th and 20th centuries (see iv, below).

Raja Soma[3] is worshipped by the priest and is made to thrive by the power of his Mantras. As such, the Devas, whose favourite food is the juice of the Soma plant offered in oblation by the priest, are always kind to him and bestow his desired boons. Thus strengthened by divine grace, he defies all human opposition; for what can the power of mortals do against that of the gods? Even the king, the centre of all earthly power, is a supplicant at his door. A kind look from him is the greatest help; his mere blessing a tribute to the State, pre-eminent above everything else. Now commanding the king to be engaged in affairs fraught with death and ruin, now standing by him as his fastest friend with kind and wise counsels, now spreading the net of subtle, diplomatic statesmanship in which the king is easily caught — the priest is seen, oftentimes, to make the royal power totally subservient to him. Above all, the worst fear is in the knowledge that the name and fame of the royal forefathers and of himself and his family lie at the mercy of the priest's pen. He is the historian. The king might have paramount power; attaining a great glory in his reign, he might prove himself as the father and mother in one to his subjects; but if the priest is not appeased, his sun of glory goes down with his last breath for ever; all his worth and usefulness deserving of universal approbation are lost in the great womb of time, like unto the fall of gentle dew on the ocean. Others who inaugurated the huge sacrifices lasting over many years, the performers of the Ashvamedha and so on — those who showered, like incessant rain in the rainy season, countless wealth on the priests — their names, thanks to the grace of priests, are emblazoned in the pages of history. The name of Priyadarshi Dharmâshoka,[4] the beloved of the gods, is nothing but a name in the priestly world, while Janamejaya,[5] son of Parikshit, is a household word in every Hindu family. To protect the State, to meet the expenses of the personal comforts and luxuries of himself and his long retinue, and, above all, to fill to overflowing the coffers of the all-powerful priesthood for its propitiation, the king is continually draining the resources of his subjects, even as the sun sucks up moisture from the earth. His especial prey — his milch cows — are the Vaishyas. Neither under the Hindu kings, nor under the Buddhist rule, do we find the common subject-people taking any part in expressing their voice in the affairs of the State. True, Yudhishthira visits the houses of Vaishyas and even Shudras when he is in Vâranâvata; true, the subjects are praying for the installation of Râmachandra to the regency of Ayodhyâ; nay, they are even criticising the conduct of Sitâ and secretly making plans for the bringing about of her exile: but as a recognised rule of the State they have no direct voice in the supreme government. The power of the populace is struggling to express itself in indirect and disorderly ways without any method. The people have not as yet the conscious knowledge of the existence of this power. There is neither the attempt on their part to organise it into a united action, nor have they got the will to do so; there is also a complete absence of that capacity, that skill, by means of which small and incoherent centres of force are united together, creating insuperable strength as their resultant. Is this due to want of proper laws? — no, that is not it. There are laws, there are methods, separately and distinctly assigned for the guidance of different departments of government, there are laws laid down in the minutest detail for everything, such as the collection of revenue, the management of the army, the administration of justice, punishments and rewards. But at the root of all, is the injunction of the Rishi — the word of divine authority, the revelation of God coming through the inspired Rishi. The laws have, it can almost be said, no elasticity in them. Under the circumstances, it is never possible for the people to acquire any sort of education by which they can learn to combine among themselves and be united for the accomplishment of any object for the common good of the people, or by which they can have the concerted intellect to conceive the idea of popular right in the treasures collected by the king from his subjects, or even such education by which they can be fired with the aspiration to gain the right of representation in the control of State revenues and expenditure. Why should they do such things? Is not the inspiration of the Rishi responsible for their prosperity and progress? Again, all those laws are in books. Between laws as codified in books and their operation in practical life, there is a world of difference. One Ramachandra is born after thousands of Agnivarnas[6] pass away! Many kings show us the life of Chandâshoka[7] ; Dharmâshokas are rare! The number of kings like Akbar, in whom the subjects find their life, is far less than that of kings like Aurangzeb who live on the blood of their people! Even if the kings be of as godlike nature as that of Yudhishthira, Ramachandra, Dharmashoka, or Akbar under whose benign rule the people enjoyed safety and prosperity, and were looked after with paternal care by their rulers, the hand of him who is always fed by another gradually loses the power of taking the food to his mouth. His power of self-preservation can never become fully manifest who is always protected in every respect by another. Even the strongest youth remains but a child if he is always looked after as a child by his parents. Being always governed by kings of godlike nature, to whom is left the whole duty of protecting and providing for the people, they can never get any occasion for understanding the principles of self-government. Such a nation, being entirely dependent on the king for everything and never caring to exert itself for the common good or for self-defence, becomes gradually destitute of inherent energy and strength. If this state of dependence and protection continues long, it becomes the cause of the destruction of the nation, and its ruin is not far to seek. Of course, it can be reasonably concluded that, when the government a country, is guided by codes of laws enjoined by Shâstras which are the outcome of knowledge inspired by the divine genius of great sages, such a government must lead to the unbroken welfare of the rich and the poor, the wise and the ignorant, the king and the subjects alike. But we have seen already how far the operation of those laws was, or may be, possible in practical life. The voice of the ruled in the government of their land — which is the watchword of the modern Western world, and of which the last expression has been echoed with a thundering voice in the Declaration of the American Government, in the words, \"That the government of the people of this country must be by the people and for the good of the people\" — cannot however be said to have been totally unrecognised in ancient India. The Greek travellers and others saw many independent small States scattered all over this country, and references are also found to this effect in many places of the Buddhistic literature. And there cannot be the least doubt about it that the germ of self-government was at least present in the shape of the village Panchâyat,[8] which is still to be found in existence in many places of India. But the germ remained for ever the germ; the seed though put in the ground never grew into a tree. This idea of self-government never passed beyond the embryo state of the village Panchayat system and never spread into society at large. In the religious communities, among Sannyasins in the Buddhist monasteries, we have ample evidence to show that self-government was fully developed. Even now, one wonders to see how the power of the Panchayat system of the principles of self-government, is working amongst the Nâgâ Sannyasins — what deep respect the \"Government by the Five\" commands from them, what effective individual rights each Naga can exercise within his own sect, what excellent working of the power of organisation and concerted action they have among themselves! With the deluge which swept the land at the advent of Buddhism, the priestly power fell into decay and the royal power was in the ascendant. Buddhist priests are renouncers of the world, living in monasteries as homeless ascetics, unconcerned with secular affairs. They have neither the will nor the endeavour to bring and keep the royal power under their control through the threat of curses or magic arrows. Even if there were any remnant of such a will, its fulfilment has now become an impossibility. For Buddhism has shaken the thrones of all the oblation-eating gods and brought them down from their heavenly positions. The state of being a Buddha is superior to the heavenly positions of many a Brahmâ or an Indra, who vie with each other in offering their worship at the feet of the Buddha, the God-man! And to this Buddhahood, every man has the privilege to attain; it is open to all even in this life. From the descent of the gods, as a natural consequence, the superiority of the priests who were supported by them is gone. Accordingly, the reins of that mighty sacrificial horse — the royal power — are no longer held in the firm grasp of the Vedic priest; and being now free, it can roam anywhere by its unbridled will. The centre of power in this period is neither with the priests chanting the Sâma hymns and performing the Yajnas according to the Yajur-Veda; nor is the power vested in the hands of Kshatriya kings separated from each other and ruling over small independent States. But the centre of power in this age is in emperors whose unobstructed sway extend over vast areas bounded by the ocean, covering the whole of India from one end to the other. The leaders of this age are no longer Vishvâmitra or Vasishtha, but emperors like Chandragupta, Dharmashoka, and others. There never were emperors who ascended the throne of India and led her to the pinnacle of her glory such as those lords of the earth who ruled over her in paramount sway during the Buddhistic period. The end of this period is characterised by the appearance of Râjput power on the scene and the rise of modern Hinduism. With the rise of Rajput power, on the decline of Buddhism, the sceptre of the Indian empire, dislodged from its paramount power, was again broken into a thousand pieces and wielded by small powerless hands. At this time, the Brâhminical (priestly) power again succeeded in raising its head, not as an adversary as before, but this time as an auxiliary to the royal supremacy. During this revolution, that perpetual struggle for supremacy between the priestly and the royal classes, which began from the Vedic times and continued through ages till it reached its climax at the time of the Jain and Buddhist revolutions, has ceased for ever. Now these two mighty powers are friendly to each other; but neither is there any more that glorious Kshatra (warlike) velour of the kings, nor that spiritual brilliance which characterised the Brahmins; each has lost his former intrinsic strength. As might be expected, this new union of the two forces was soon engaged in the satisfaction of mutual self-interests, and became dissipated by spending its vitality on extirpating their common opponents, especially the Buddhists of the time, and on similar other deeds. Being steeped in all the vices consequent on such a union, e.g., the sucking of the blood of the masses, taking revenge on the enemy, spoliation of others' property, etc., they in vain tried to imitate the Râjasuya and other Vedic sacrifices of the ancient kings, and only made a ridiculous farce of them. The result was that they were bound hand and foot by a formidable train of sycophantic attendance and its obsequious flatteries, and being entangled in an interminable net of rites and ceremonies with flourishes of Mantras and the like, they soon became a cheap and ready prey to the Mohammeden invaders from the West. That priestly power which began its strife for superiority with the royal power from the Vedic times and continued it down the ages, that hostility against the Kshatra power, Bhagavân Shri Krishna succeeded by his super-human genius in putting a stop to, at least for the tired being, during his earthly existence. That Brâhmanya power was almost effaced from its field of work in India during the Jain and Buddhist revolutions, or, perhaps, was holding its feeble stand by being subservient to the strong antagonistic religions. That Brahmanya power, since this appearance of Rajput power, which held sway over India under the Mihira dynasty and others, made its last effort to recover its lost greatness; and in its effort to establish that supremacy, it sold itself at the feet of the fierce hordes of barbarians newly come from Central Asia, and to win their pleasure introduced in the land their hateful manners and customs. Moreover, it, the Brahmanya; power, solely devoting itself to the easy means to dupe ignorant barbarians, brought into vogue mysterious rites and ceremonies backed by its new Mantras and the like; and in doing so, itself lost its former wisdom, its former vigour and vitality, and its own chaste habits of long acquirement. Thus it turned the whole Âryâvarta into a deep and vast whirlpool of the most vicious, the most horrible, the most abominable, barbarous customs; and as the inevitable consequence of countenancing these detestable customs and superstitions, it soon lost all its own internal strength and stamina and became the weakest of the weak. What wonder that it should be broken into a thousand pieces and fall at the mere touch of the storm of Mussulman invasions from the West! That great Brahmanya power fell — who knows, if ever to rise again? The resuscitation of the priestly power under the Mussulman rule was, on the other hand, an utter impossibility. The Prophet Mohammed himself was dead against the priestly class in any shape and tried his best for the total destruction of this power by formulating rules and injunctions to that effect. Under the Mussulman rule, the king himself was the supreme priest; he was the chief guide in religious matters; and when he became the emperor, he cherished the hope of being the paramount leader in all matters over the whole Mussulman world. To the Mussulman, the Jews or the Christians are not objects of extreme detestation; they are, at the worst, men of little faith. But not so the Hindu. According to him, the Hindu is idolatrous, the hateful Kafir; hence in this life he deserves to be butchered; and in the next, eternal hell is in store for him. The utmost the Mussulman kings could do as a favour to the priestly class — the spiritual guides of these Kafirs — was to allow them somehow to pass their life silently and wait for the last moment. This was again sometimes considered too, much kindness! If the religious ardour of any king was a little more uncommon, there would immediately follow arrangements for a great Yajna by way of Kafir-slaughter! On one side, the royal power is now centred in kings professing a different religion and given to different customs. On the other, the priestly power has been entirely displaced from its influential position as the controller and lawgiver of the society. The Koran and its code of laws have taken the place of the Dharma Shâstras of Manu and others. The Sanskrit language has made room for the Persian and the Arabic. The Sanskrit language has to remain confined only to the purely religious writings and religious matters of the conquered and detested Hindu, and, as such, has since been living a precarious life at the hands of the neglected priest. The priest himself, the relic of the Brahmanya power, fell back upon the last resource of conducting only the comparatively unimportant family ceremonies, such as the matrimonial etc., and that also only so long and as much as the mercy of the Mohammedan rulers permitted. In the Vedic and the adjoining periods, the royal power could not manifest itself on account of the grinding pressure of the priestly power. We have seen how, during the Buddhistic revolution, resulting in the fall of the Brahminical supremacy, the royal power in India reached its culminating point. In the interval between the fall of the Buddhistic and the establishment of the Mohammedan empire, we have seen how the royal power was trying to raise its head through the Rajputs in India, and how it failed in its attempt. At the root of this failure, too, could be traced the same old endeavours of the Vedic priestly class to bring back and revive with a new life their original (ritualistic) days. Crushing the Brahminical supremacy under his feet the Mussulman king was able to restore to a considerable extent the lost glories of such dynasties of emperors as the Maurya, the Gupta, the Andhra, and the Kshâtrapa.[9] Thus the priestly power — which sages like Kumârila, Shankara, and Râmânuja tried to re-establish, which for some time was supported by the sword of the Rajput power, and which tried to rebuild its structure on the fall of its Jain and Buddhist adversaries — was under Mohammedan rule laid to sleep for ever, knowing no awakening. In this period, the antagonism or warfare is not between kings and priests, but between kings and kings. At the end of this period, when Hindu power again raised its head, and, to some extent, was successful in regenerating Hinduism through the Mahrattas and the Sikhs, we do not find much play of the priestly power with these regenerations. On the contrary, when the Sikhs admitted any Brahmin into their sect, they, at first, compelled him publicly to give up his previous Brahminical signs and adopt the recognised signs of their own religion. In this manner, after an age-long play of action and reaction between these two forces, the final victory of the royal power was echoed on the soil of India for several centuries, in the name of foreign monarchs professing an entirely different religion from the faith of the land. But at the end of this Mohammedan period, another entirely new power made its appearance on the arena and slowly began to assert its prowess in the affairs of the Indian world. This power is so new, its nature and workings are so foreign to the Indian mind, its rise so inconceivable, and its vigour so insuperable that though it wields the suzerain power up till now, only a handful of Indians understand what this power is. We are talking of the occupation of India by England. From very ancient times, the fame of India's vast wealth and her rich granaries has enkindled in many powerful foreign nations the desire for conquering her. She has been, in fact, again and again conquered by foreign nations. Then why should we say that the occupation of India by England was something new and foreign to the Indian mind? From time immemorial Indians have seen the mightiest royal power tremble before the frown of the ascetic priest, devoid of worldly desire, armed with spiritual strength — the power of Mantras (sacred formulas) and religious lore — and the weapon of curses. They have also seen the subject people silently obey the commands of their heroic all-powerful suzerains, backed by their arms and armies, like a flock of sheep before a lion. But that a handful of Vaishyas (traders) who, despite their great wealth, have ever crouched awe stricken not only before the king but also before any member of the royal family, would unite, cross for purposes of business rivers and seas, would, solely by virtue of their intelligence and wealth, by degrees make puppets of the long-established Hindu and Mohammedan dynasties; not only so, but that they would buy as well the services of the ruling powers of their own country and use their valour and learning as powerful instruments for the influx of their own riches — this is a spectacle entirely novel to the Indians, as also the spectacle that the descendants of the mighty nobility of a country, of which a proud lord, sketched by the extraordinary pen of its great poet, says to a common man, \"Out, dunghill! darest thou brave a nobleman?\" would, in no distant future, consider it the zenith of human ambition to be sent to India as obedient servants of a body of merchants, called The East India Company — such a sight was, indeed, a novelty unseen by India before! According to the prevalence, in greater or lesser degree, of the three qualities of Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas in man, the four castes, the Brahmin, Kashatriya, Vaishya, and Shudra, are everywhere present at all times, in all civilised societies. By the mighty hand of time, their number and power also vary at different times in regard to different countries. In some countries the numerical strength or influence of one of these castes may preponderate over another; at some period, one of the classes may be more powerful than the rest. But from a careful study of the history of the world, it appears that in conformity to the law of nature the four castes, the Brahmin, Kshatriya, Vaishya, and Shudra do, in every society, one after another in succession, govern the world. Among the Chinese, the Sumerians, the Babylonians, the Egyptians, the Chaldeans, the Areas, the Iranians, the Jews, the Arabs — among all these ancient nations, the supreme power of guiding society is, in the first period of their history, in the hands of the Brahmin or the priest. In the second period, the ruling power is the Kshatriya, that is, either absolute monarchy or oligarchical government by a chosen body of men. Among the modern Western nations, with England at their head, this power of controlling society has been, for the first time, in the hands of the Vaishyas or mercantile communities, made rich through the carrying on of commerce. Though Troy and Carthage of ancient times and Venice and similar other small commercial States of comparatively modern times became highly powerful, yet, amongst them, there was not the real rising of the Vaishya power in the proper sense of the term. Correctly speaking, the descendants of the royal family had the sole monopoly of the commerce of those old days by employing the common people and their servants under them to carry on the trade; and they appropriated to themselves the profits accruing from it. Excepting these few men, no one was allowed to take any part or voice an opinion even in the government of the country and kindred affairs. In the oldest countries like Egypt, the priestly power enjoyed unmolested supremacy only for a short period, after which it became subjugated to the royal power and lived as an auxiliary to it. In China, the royal power, centralised by the genius of Confucius, has been controlling and guiding the priestly power, in accordance with its absolute will, for more than twenty-five centuries; and during the last two centuries, the all-absorbing Lamas of Tibet, though they are the spiritual guides of the royal family, have been compelled to pass their days, being subject in every way to the Chinese Emperor. In India, the royal power succeeded in conquering the priestly power and declaring its untrammelled authority long after the other ancient civilised nations had done so; and therefore the inauguration of the Indian Empire came about long after the Chinese, Egyptian, Babylonian, and other Empires had risen. It was only with the Jewish people that the royal power, though it tried hard to establish its supremacy over the priestly, had to meet a complete defeat in the attempt. Not even the Vaishyas attained the ruling power with the Jews. On the other hand, the common subject people, trying to free themselves from the shackles of priestcraft, were crushed to death under the internal commotion of adverse religious movements like Christianity and the external pressure of the mighty Roman Empire. As in the ancient days the priestly power, in spite of its long-continued struggle, was subdued by the more powerful royal power, so, in modern times, before the violent blow of the newly-risen Vaishya power, many a kingly crown has to kiss the ground, many a sceptre is for ever broken to pieces. Only those few thrones which are allowed still to exercise some power in some of the civilised countries and make a display of their royal pomp and grandeur are all maintained solely by the vast hordes of wealth of these Vaishya communities — the dealers in salt, oil, sugar, and wine — and kept up as a magnificent and an imposing front, and as a means of glorification to the really governing body behind, the Vaishyas. That mighty newly-risen Vaishya power — at whose command, electricity carries messages in an instant from one pole to another, whose highway is the vast ocean, with its mountain-high waves, at whose instance, commodities are being carried with the greatest ease from one part of the globe to another, and at whose mandate, even the greatest monarchs tremble — on the white foamy crest of that huge wave the all-conquering Vaishya power, is installed the majestic throne of England in all its grandeur. Therefore the conquest of India by England is not a conquest by Jesus or the Bible as we are often asked to believe. Neither is it like the conquest of India by the Moguls and the Pathans. But behind the name of the Lord Jesus, the Bible, the magnificent palaces, the heavy tramp of the feet of armies consisting of elephants, chariots, cavalry, and infantry, shaking the earth, the sounds of war trumpets, bugles, and drums, and the splendid display of the royal throne, behind all these, there is always the virtual presence of England — that England whose war flag is the factory chimney, whose troops are the merchantmen, whose battlefields are the market-places of the world, and whose Empress is the shining Goddess of Fortune herself! It is on this account I have said before that it is indeed an unseen novelty, this conquest of India by England. What new revolution will be effected in India by her clash with the new giant power, and as the result of that revolution what new transformation is in store for future India, cannot be inferred from her past history. I have stated previously that the four castes, Brahmin, Kshatriya, Vaishya, and Shudra do, in succession, rule the world. During the period of supreme authority exercised by each of these castes, some acts are accomplished which conduce to the welfare of the people, while others are injurious to them. The foundation of the priestly power rests on intellectual strength, and not on the physical strength of arms. Therefore, with the supremacy of the priestly power, there is a great prevalence of intellectual and literary culture. Every human heart is always anxious for communication with, and help from, the supersensuous spiritual world. The entrance to that world is not possible for the generality of mankind; only a few great souls who can acquire a perfect control over their sense-organs and who are possessed with a nature preponderating with the essence of Sattva Guna are able to pierce the formidable wall of matter and come face to face, as it were, with the supersensuous — it is only they who know the workings of the kingdom that bring the messages from it and show the way to others. These great souls are the priests, the primitive guides, leaders, and movers of human societies. The priest knows the gods and communicates with them; he is therefore worshipped as a god. Leaving behind the thoughts of the world, he has no longer to devote himself to the earning of his bread by the sweat of his brow. The best and foremost parts of all food and drink are due as offerings to the gods; and of these gods, the visible proxies on earth are the priests. It is through their mouths that they partake of the offerings. Knowingly or unknowingly, society gives the priest abundant leisure, and he can therefore get the opportunity of being meditative and of thinking higher thoughts. Hence the development of wisdom and learning originates first with the supremacy of the priestly power. There stands the priest between the dreadful lion — the king — on the one hand, and the terrified flock of sheep — the subject people — on the other. The destructive leap of the lion is checked by the controlling rod of spiritual power in the hands of the priest. The flame of the despotic will of the king, maddened in the pride of his wealth and men, is able to burn into ashes everything that comes in his way; but it is only a word from the priest, who has neither wealth nor men behind him but whose sole strength is his spiritual power, that can quench the despotic royal will, as water the fire. With the ascendancy of the priestly supremacy are seen the first advent of civilisation, the first victory of the divine nature over the animal, the first mastery of spirit over matter, and the first manifestation of the divine power which is potentially present in this very slave of nature, this lump of flesh, to wit, the human body. The priest is the first discriminator of spirit from matter, the first to help to bring this world in communion with the next, the first messenger from the gods to man, and the intervening bridge that connects the king with his subjects. The first offshoot of universal welfare and good is nursed by his spiritual power, by his devotion to learning and wisdom, by his renunciation, the watchword of his life and, watered even by the flow of his own life-blood. It is therefore that in every land it was he to whom the first and foremost worship was offered. It is therefore that even his memory is sacred to us! There are evils as well. With the growth of life is sown simultaneously the seed of death. Darkness and light always go together. Indeed, there are great evils which, if not checked in proper time, lead to the ruin of society. The play of power through gross matter is universally experienced; everyone sees, everyone understands, the mighty manifestation of gross material force as displayed in the play of battle-axes and swords, or in the burning properties of fire and lightning. Nobody doubts these things, nor can there ever be any question about their genuineness. But where the repository of power and the centre of its play are wholly mental, where the power is confined to certain special words, to certain special modes of uttering them, to the mental repetition of certain mysterious syllables, or to other similar processes and applications of the mind, there light is mixed with shade, there the ebb and flow naturally disturb the otherwise unshaken faith, and there even when things are actually seen or directly perceived, still sometimes doubts arise as to their real occurrence. Where distress, fear, anger, malice, spirit of retaliation, and the like passions of man, leaving the palpable force of arms, leaving the gross material methods to gain the end in view which every one can understand, substitute in their stead the mysterious mental processes like Stambhana, Uchchâtana, Vashikarana, and Mârana[10] for their fructification — there a cloud of smoky indistinctness, as it were, naturally envelops the mental atmosphere of these men who often live and move in such hazy worlds of obscure mysticism. No straight line of action presents itself before such a mind; even if it does, the mind distorts it into crookedness. The final result of all this is insincerity — that very limited narrowness of the heart — and above all, the most fatal is the extreme intolerance born of malicious envy at the superior excellence of another. The priest naturally says to himself: \"Why should I part with the power that has made the Devas subservient to me, has given me mastery over physical and mental illnesses, and has gained for me the service of ghosts, demons, and other unseen spirits? I have dearly bought this power by the price of extreme renunciation. Why should I give to others that to get which I had to give up my wealth, name, fame, in short, all my earthly comforts and happiness?\" Again, that power is entirely mental. And how many opportunities are there of keeping it a perfect secret! Entangled in this wheel of circumstances, human nature becomes what it inevitably would: being used to practice constant self-concealment, it becomes a victim of extreme selfishness and hypocrisy, and at last succumbs to the poisonous consequences which they bring in their train. In time, the reaction of this very desire to concealment rebounds upon oneself. All knowledge, all wisdom is almost lost for want of proper exercise and diffusion, and what little remains is thought to have been obtained from some supernatural source; and, therefore, far from making fresh efforts to go in for originality and gain knowledge of new sciences, it is considered useless and futile to attempt even to improve the remnants of the old by cleansing them of their corruptions. Thus lost to former wisdom, the former indomitable spirit of self-reliance, the priest, now glorifying himself merely in the name of his forefathers, vainly struggles to preserve untarnished for himself the same glory, the same privilege, the same veneration, and the same supremacy as was enjoyed by his great forefathers. Consequently, his violent collision with the other castes. According to the law of nature, wherever there is an awakening of a new and stronger life, there it tries to conquer and take the place of the old and the decaying. Nature favours the dying out of the unfit and the survival of the fittest. The final result of such conflict between the priestly and the other classes has been mentioned already. That renunciation, self-control, and asceticism of the priest which during the period of his ascendancy were devoted to the pursuance of earnest researches of truth are on the eve of his decline employed anew and spent solely in the accumulation of objects of self-gratification and in the extension of privileged superiority over others. That power, the centralization of which in himself gave him all honour and worship, has now been dragged down from its high heavenly position to the lowest abyss of hell. Having lost sight of the goal, drifting aimless, the priestly power is entangled, like the spider, in the web spun by itself. The chain that has been forged from generation to generation with the greatest care to be put on others' feet is now tightened round its own in a thousand coils, and is thwarting its own movement in hundreds of ways. Caught in the endless thread of the net of infinite rites, ceremonies, and customs, which it spread on all sides as external means for purification of the body and the mind with a view to keeping society in the iron grasp of these innumerable bonds — the priestly power, thus hopelessly entangled from head to foot, is now asleep in despair! There is no escaping out of it now. Tear the net, and the priesthood of the priest is shaken to its foundation! There is implanted in every man, naturally, a strong desire for progress; and those who, finding that the fulfilment of this desire is an impossibility so long as one is trammelled in the shackles of priesthood, rend this net and take to the profession of other castes in order to earn money thereby — them, the society immediately dispossesses of their priestly rights. Society has no faith in the Brahminhood of the so-called Brahmins who, instead of keeping the Shikhâ,[11] part their hair, who, giving up their ancient habits and ancestral customs, clothe themselves in semi European dress and adopt the newly introduced usages from the West in a hybrid fashion. Again, in those parts of India, wherever this new-comer, the English Government, is introducing new modes of education and opening up new channels for the coming in of wealth, there hosts of Brahmin youths are giving up their hereditary priestly profession and trying to earn their livelihood and become rich by adopting the callings of other castes, with the result that the habits and customs of the priestly class, handed down from their distant forefathers, are scattered to the winds and are fast disappearing from the land. In Gujarat, each secondary sect of the Brahmins is divided into two subdivisions, one being those who still stick to the priestly profession, while the other lives by other professions. There only the first subdivisions, carrying on the priestly profession, are called \"Brâhmanas\", and though the other subdivisions are by lineage descendants from Brahmin fathers, yet the former do not link themselves in matrimonial relation with the latter. For example, by the name of \"Nâgara Brâhmana\" are meant only those Brahmins who are priests living on alms; and by the name \"Nâgara\" only are meant those Brahmins who have accepted service under the Government, or those who have been carrying on the Vaishya's profession. But it appears that such distinctions will not long continue in these days in Gujarat. Even the sons of the \"Nagara Brahmanas\" are nowadays getting English education, and entering into Government service, or adopting some mercantile business. Even orthodox Pandits of the old school, undergoing pecuniary difficulties, are sending their sons to the colleges of the English universities or making them choose the callings of Vaidyas, Kâyasthas, and other non-Brahmin castes. If the current of affairs goes on running in this course, then it is a question of most serious reflection, no doubt, how long more will the priestly class continue on India's soil. Those who lay the fault of attempting to bring down the supremacy of the priestly class at the door of any particular person or body of persons other than themselves ought to know that, in obedience to the inevitable law of nature, the Brahmin caste is erecting with its own hands its own sepulchre; and this is what ought to be. It is good and appropriate that every caste of high birth and privileged nobility should make it its principal duty to raise its own funeral pyre with its own hands. Accumulation of power is as necessary as its diffusion, or rather more so. The accumulation of blood in the heart is an indispensable condition for life; its non-circulation throughout the body means death. For the welfare of society, it is absolutely necessary at certain times to have all knowledge and power concentrated in certain families or castes to the exclusion of others, but that concentrated power is focussed for the time being, only to be scattered broadcast over the whole of society in future. If this diffusion be withheld, the destruction of that society is, without doubt, near at hand. On the other side, the king is like the lion; in him are present both the good and evil propensities of the lord of beasts. Never for a moment his fierce nails are held back from tearing to pieces the heart of innocent animals, living on herbs and grass, to allay his thirst for blood when occasion arises; again, the poet says, though himself stricken with old age and dying with hunger, the lion never kills the weakest fox that throws itself in his arms for protection. If the subject classes, for a moment, stand as impediments in the way of the gratification of the senses of the royal lion, their death knell is inevitably tolled; if they humbly bow down to his commands, they are perfectly safe. Not only so. Not to speak of ancient days, even in modern times, no society can be found in any country where the effectiveness of individual self-sacrifice for the good of the many and of the oneness of purpose and endeavour actuating every member of the society for the common good of the whole have been fully realised. Hence the necessity of the kings who are the creations of the society itself. They are the centres where all the forces of society, otherwise loosely scattered about, are made to converge, and from which they start and course through the body politic and animate society. As during the Brâhminical supremacy, at the first stage is the awakening of the first impulse for search after knowledge, and later the continual and careful fostering of the growth of that impulse still in its infancy — so, during the Kshatriya supremacy, a strong desire for pleasure pursuits has made its appearance at the first stage, and later have sprung up inventions and developments of arts and sciences as the means for its gratification. Can the king, in the height of his glory, hide his proud head within the lowly cottages of the poor? Or can the common good of his subjects ever minister to his royal appetite with satisfaction? He whose dignity bears no comparison with anyone else on earth, he who is divinity residing in the temple of the human body — for the common man, to cast even a mere glance at his, the king's, objects of pleasure is a great sin; to think of ever possessing them is quite out of the question. The body of the king is not like the bodies of other people, it is too sacred to be polluted by any contamination; in certain countries it is even believed never to come under the sway of death. A halo of equal sacredness shines around the queen, so she is scrupulously guarded from the gaze of the common folk, not even the sun may cast a glance on her beauty! Hence the rising of magnificent palaces to take the place of thatched cottages. The sweet harmonious strain of artistic music, flowing as it were from heaven, silenced the disorderly jargon of the rabble. Delightful gardens, pleasant groves, beautiful galleries, charming paintings, exquisite sculptures, fine and costly apparel began to displace by gradual steps the natural beauties of rugged woods and the rough and coarse dress of the simple rustic. Thousands of intelligent men left the toilsome task of the ploughman and turned their attention to the new field of fine arts, where they could display the finer play of their intellect in less laborious and easier ways. Villages lost their importance; cities rose in their stead. It was in India, again, that the kings, after having enjoyed for some time earthly pleasures to their full satisfaction, were stricken at the latter part of their lives with heavy world-weariness, as is sure to follow on extreme sense-gratification; and thus being satiated with worldly pleasures, they retired at their old age into secluded forests, and there began to contemplate the deep problems of life. The results of such renunciation and deep meditation were marked by a strong dislike for cumbrous rites and ceremonials and an extreme devotion to the highest spiritual truths which we find embodied in the Upanishads, the Gita, and the Jain and the Buddhist scriptures. Here also was a great conflict between the priestly and the royal powers. Disappearance of the elaborate rites and ceremonials meant a death-blow to the priest's profession. Therefore, naturally, at all times and in every country, the priests gird up their loins and try their best to preserve the ancient customs and usages, while on the other side stand in opposition kings like Janaka, backed by Kshatriya prowess as well as spiritual power. We have dealt at length already on this bitter antagonism between the two parties. As the priest is busy about centralising all knowledge and learning at a common centre, to wit, himself, so the king is ever up and doing in collecting all the earthly powers and focusing them in a central point, i.e. his own self. Of course, both are beneficial to society. At one time they are both needed for the common good of society, but that is only at its infant stage. But if attempts be made, when society has passed its infant stage and reached its vigorous youthful condition, to clothe it by force with the dress which suited it in its infancy and keep it bound within narrow limits, then either it bursts the bonds by virtue of its own strength and tries to advance, or where it fails to do so, it retraces its footsteps and by slow degrees returns to its primitive uncivilised condition. Kings are like parents to their subjects, and the subjects are the kings' children. The subjects should, in every respect, look up to the king and stick to their king with unreserved obedience, and the king should rule them with impartial justice and look to their welfare and bear the same affection towards them as he would towards his own children. But what rule applies to individual homes applies to the whole society as well, for society is only the aggregate of individual homes. \"When the son attains the age of sixteen, the father ought to deal with him as his friend and equal\"[12] — if that is the rule, does not the infant society ever attain that age of sixteen? It is the evidence of history that at a certain time every society attains its manhood, when a strong conflict ensues between the ruling power and the common people. The life of the society, its expansion and civilisation, depend on its victory or defeat in this conflict. Such changes, revolutionizing society, have been happening in India again and again, only in this country they have been effected in the name of religion, for religion is the life of India, religion is the language of this country, the symbol of all its movements. The Chârvâka, the Jain, the Buddhist, Shankara, Ramanuja, Kabir, Nânak, Chaitanya, the Brâhmo Samâj, the Arya Samaj — of all these and similar other sects, the wave of religion, foaming, thundering, surging, breaks in the front, while in the rear follows the filling-up of social wants. If all desires can be accomplished by the mere utterance of some meaningless syllables, then who will exert himself and go through difficulties to work out the fulfilment of his desires? If this malady enters into the entire body of any social system, then that society becomes slothful and indisposed to any exertion, and soon hastens to it, ruin. Hence the slashing sarcasm of the Charvakas, who believed only in the reality of sense-perceptions and nothing beyond. What could have saved Indian society from the ponderous burden of omnifarious ritualistic ceremonialism, with its animal and other sacrifices, which all but crushed the very life out of it, except the Jain revolution which took its strong stand exclusively on chaste morals and philosophical truth? Or without the Buddhist revolution what would have delivered the suffering millions of the lower classes from the violent tyrannies of the influential higher castes? When, in course of time, Buddhism declined and its extremely pure and moral character gave place to equally bad, unclean, and immoral practices, when Indian society trembled under the infernal dance of the various races of barbarians who were allowed into the Buddhistic fold by virtue of its universal all-embracing spirit of equality — then Shankara, and later Ramanuja, appeared on the scene and tried their best to bring society back to its former days of glory and re-establish its lost status. Again, it is an undoubted fact that if there had not been the advent of Kabir, Nanak, and Chaitanya in the Mohammedan period, and the establishment of the Brahmo Samaj and the Arya Samaj in our own day, then, by this time, the Mohammedans and the Christians would have far outnumbered the Hindus of the present day in India. What better material is there than nourishing food to build up the body composed of various elements, and the mind which sends out infinite waves of thought? But if that food which goes to sustain the body and strengthen the mind is not properly assimilated, and the natural functions of the body do not work properly, then that very thing becomes the root of all evil. The individual's life is in the life of the whole, the individual's happiness is in the happiness of the whole; apart from the whole, the individual's existence is inconceivable — this is an eternal truth and is the bed-rock on which the universe is built. To move slowly towards the infinite whole, bearing a constant feeling of intense sympathy and sameness with it, being happy with its happiness and being distressed in its affliction, is the individual's sole duty. Not only is it his duty, but in its transgression is his death, while compliance with this great truth leads to life immortal. This is the law of nature, and who can throw dust into her ever-watchful eyes? None can hoodwink society and deceive it for any length of time. However much there may have accumulated heaps of refuse and mud on the surface of society — still, at the bottom of those heaps the life-breath of society is ever to be found pulsating with the vibrations of universal love and self-denying compassion for all. Society is like the earth that patiently bears incessant molestations; but she wakes up one day, however long that may be in coming, and the force of the shaking tremors of that awakening hurls off to a distance the accumulated dirt of self-seeking meanness piled up during millions of patient and silent years! We ignore this sublime truth; and though we suffer a thousand times for our folly, yet, in our absurd foolishness, impelled by the brute in us, we do not believe in it. We try to deceive, but a thousand times we find we are deceived ourselves, and yet we do not desist! Mad that we are, we imagine we can impose on nature' With our shortsighted vision we think ministering to the self at any cost is the be-all and end-all of life. Wisdom, knowledge, wealth, men, strength, prowess and whatever else nature gathers and provides us with, are all only for diffusion, when the moment of need is at hand. We often forget this fact, put the stamp of \"mine only\" upon the entrusted deposits, and pari passu, we sow the seed of our own ruin! The king, the centre of the forces of the aggregate of his subjects, soon forgets that those forces are only stored with him so that he may increase and give them back a thousandfold in their potency, so that they may spread over the whole community for its good. Attributing all Godship to himself, in his pride, like the king Vena[13] he looks upon other people as wretched specimens of humanity who should grovel before him; any opposition to his will, whether good or bad, is a great sin on the part of his subjects. Hence oppression steps into the place of protection — sucking their blood in place of preservation. If the society is weak and debilitated, it silently suffers all ill-treatment at the hands of the king, and as the natural consequence, both the king and his people go down and down and fall into the most degraded state, and thus become an easy prey to any nation stronger than themselves. Where the society is healthy and strong, there soon follows a fierce contest between the king and his subjects, and, by its reaction and convulsion, are flung away the sceptre and the crown; and the throne and the royal paraphernalia become like past curiosities preserved in the museum galleries. As the result of this contest — as its reaction — is the appearance of the mighty power of the Vaishya, before whose angry glance the crowned heads, the lords of heroes, tremble like an aspen leaf on their thrones — whom the poor as well as the prince humbly follow in vain expectation of the golden jar in his hands, that like Tantalus's fruit always recedes from the grasp. The Brahmin said, \"Learning is the power of all powers; that learning is dependent upon me, I possess that learning, so the society must follow my bidding.\" For some days such was the case. The Kshatriya said, \"But for the power of my sword, where would you be, O Brahmin, with all your power of lore? You would in no time be wiped off the face of the earth. It is I alone that am the superior.\" Out flew the flaming sword from the jingling scabbard — society humbly recognised it with bended head. Even the worshipper of learning was the first to turn into the worshipper of the king. The Vaishya is saying, \"You, madmen I what you call the effulgent all-pervading deity is here, in my hand, the ever-shining gold, the almighty sovereign. Behold, through its grace, I am also equally all-powerful. O Brahmin! even now, I shall buy through its grace all your wisdom, learning, prayers, and meditation. And, O great king! your sword, arms, valour, and prowess will soon be employed, through the grace of this, my gold, in carrying out my desired objects. Do you see those lofty and extensive mills? Those are my hives. See, how, swarms of millions of bees, the Shudras, are incessantly gathering honey for those hives. Do you know for whom? For me, this me, who in due course of time will squeeze out every drop of it for my own use and profit.\" As during the supremacy of the Brahmin and the Kshatriya, there is a centralization of learning and advancement of civilization, so the result of the supremacy of the Vaishya is accumulation of wealth. The power of the Vaishya lies in the possession of that coin, the charm of whose clinking sound works with an irresistible fascination on the minds of the four castes. The Vaishya is always in fear lest the Brahmin swindles him out of this, his only possession, and lest the Kshatriya usurps it by virtue of his superior strength of arms. For self-preservation, the Vaishyas as a body are, therefore, of one mind. The Vaishya commands the money; the exorbitant interest that he can exact for its use by others, as with a lash in his hand, is his powerful weapon which strikes terror in the heart of all. By the power of his money, he is always busy curbing the royal power. That the royal power may not anyhow stand in the way of the inflow of his riches, the merchant is ever watchful. But, for all that, he has never the least wish that the power should pass on from the kingly to the Shudra class. To what country does not the merchant go? Though himself ignorant, he carries on his trade and transplants the learning, wisdom, art, and science of one country to another. The wisdom, civilization, and arts that accumulated in the heart of the social body during the Brahmin and the Kshatriya supremacies are being diffused in all directions by the arteries of commerce to the different market-places of the Vaishya. But for the rising of this Vaishya power, who would have carried today the culture, learning, acquirements, and articles of food and luxury of one end of the world to the other? And where are they through whose physical labour only are possible the influence of the Brahmin, the prowess of the Kshatriya, and the fortune of the Vaishya? What is their history, who, being the real body of society, are designated at all times in all countries as \"baseborn\"? — for whom kind India prescribed the mild punishments, \"Cut out his tongue, chop off his flesh\", and others of like nature, for such a grave offence as any attempt on their part to gain a share of the knowledge and wisdom monopolised by her higher classes — those \"moving corpses\" of India and the \"beasts of burden\" of other countries — the Shudras, what is their lot in life? What shall I say of India? Let alone her Shudra class, her Brahmins to whom belonged the acquisition of scriptural knowledge are now the foreign professors, her Kshatriyas the ruling Englishmen, and Vaishyas, too, the English in whose bone and marrow is the instinct of trade, so that, only the Shudra-ness — the-beast-of-burdenness — is now left with the Indians themselves. A cloud of impenetrable darkness has at present equally enveloped us all. Now there is neither firmness of purpose nor boldness of enterprise, neither courage of heart nor strength of mind, neither aversion to maltreatments by others nor dislike for slavery, neither love in the heart nor hope nor manliness; but what we have in India are only deep-rooted envy and strong antipathy against one another, morbid desire to ruin by hook or by crook the weak, and to lick dog-like the feet of the strong. Now the highest satisfaction consists in the display of wealth and power, devotion in self-gratification, wisdom in the accumulation of transitory objects, Yoga in hideous diabolical practices, work in the slavery of others, civilisation in base imitation of foreign nations, eloquence in the use of abusive language, the merit of literature in extravagant flatteries of the rich or in the diffusion of ghastly obscenities! What to speak separately of the distinct Shudra class of such a land, where the whole population has virtually come down to the level of the Shudra? The Shudras of countries other than India have become, it seems, a little awake; but they are wanting in proper education and have only the mutual hatred of men of their own class — a trait common to Shudras. What avails it if they greatly outnumber the other classes? That unity, by which ten men collect the strength of a million, is yet far away from the Shudra; hence, according to the law of nature, the Shudras invariably form the subject race. But there is hope. In the mighty course of time, the Brahmin and the other higher castes, too, are being brought down to the lower status of the Shudras, and the Shudras are being raised to higher ranks. Europe, once the land of Shudras enslaved by Rome, is now filled with Kshatriya valour. Even before our eyes, powerful China, with fast strides, is going down to Shudra-hood, while insignificant Japan, rising with the sudden start of a rocket, is throwing off her Shudra nature and is invading by degrees the rights of the higher castes. The attaining of modern Greece and Italy to Kshatriya-hood and the decline of Turkey, Spain, and other countries, also, deserve consideration here. Yet, a time will come when there will be the rising of the Shudra class, with their Shudra-hood; that is to say, not like that as at present when the Shudras are becoming great by acquiring the characteristic qualities of the Vaishya or the Kshatriya, but a time will come when the Shudras of every country, with their inborn Shudra nature and habits — not becoming in essence Vaishya or Kshatriya, but remaining as Shudras — will gain absolute supremacy in every society. The first glow of the dawn of this new power has already begun to break slowly upon the Western world, and the thoughtful are at their wits' end to reflect upon the final issue of this fresh phenomenon. Socialism, Anarchism, Nihilism,[14] and other like sects are the vanguard of the social revolution that is to follow. As the result of grinding pressure and tyranny, from time out of mind, the Shudras, as a rule, are either meanly senile, licking dog-like the feet of the higher class, or otherwise are as inhuman as brute beasts. Again, at all times their hopes and aspirations are baffled; hence a firmness of purpose and perseverance in action they have none. In spite of the spread of education in the West, there is a great hindrance in the way of the rising of the Shudra class, and that is the recognition of caste as determined by the inherence of more or less good or bad qualities. By this very qualitative caste system which obtained in India in ancient days, the Shudra class was kept down, bound hand and foot. In the first place, scarcely any opportunity was given to the Shudra for the accumulation of wealth or the earning of proper knowledge and education; to add to this disadvantage, if ever a man of extraordinary parts and genius were born of the Shudra class, the influential higher sections of the society forthwith showered titular honours on him and lifted him up to their own circle. His wealth and the power of his wisdom were employed for the benefit of an alien caste — and his own caste-people reaped no benefits of his attainments; and not only so, the good-for-nothing people, the scum and refuse of the higher castes, were cast off and thrown into the Shudra class to swell their number. Vasishtha, Nârada, Satyakâma Jâbâla, Vyâsa, Kripa, Drona, Karna, and others of questionable parentage[15] were raised to the position of a Brahmin or a Kshatriya, in virtue of their superior learning or valour; but it remains to be seen how the prostitute, maidservant, fisherman, or the charioteer[16] class was benefited by these upliftings. Again, on the other hand, the fallen from the Brahmin, the Kshatriya, or the Vaishya class were always brought down to fill the ranks of the Shudras. In modern India, no one born of Shudra parents, be he a millionaire or a great Pandit, has ever the right to leave his own society, with the result that the power of his wealth, intellect, or wisdom, remaining confined within his own caste limits, is being employed for the betterment of his own community. This hereditary caste system of India, being thus unable to overstep its own bounds, is slowly but surely conducing to the advancement of the people moving within the same circle. The improvement of the lower classes of India will go on, in this way, so long as India will be under a government dealing with its subjects irrespective of their caste and position. Whether the leadership of society be in the hands of those who monopolise learning or wield the power of riches or arms, the source of its power is always the subject masses. By so much as the class in power severs itself from this source, by so much is it sure to become weak. But such is the strange irony of fate, such is the queer working of Mâyâ, that they from whom this power is directly or indirectly drawn, by fair means or foul — by deceit, stratagem, force, or by voluntary gift — they soon cease to be taken into account by the leading class. When in course of time, the priestly power totally estranged itself from the subject masses, the real dynamo of its power, it was overthrown by the then kingly power taking its stand on the strength of the subject people; again, the kingly power, judging itself to be perfectly independent, created a gaping chasm between itself and the subject people, only to be itself destroyed or become a mere puppet in the hands of the Vaishyas, who now succeeded in securing a relatively greater co-operation of the mass of the people. The Vaishyas have now gained their end; so they no longer deign to count on help from the subject people and are trying their best to dissociate themselves from them; consequently, here is being sown the seed of the destruction of this power as well. Though themselves the reservoir of all powers, the subject masses, creating an eternal distance between one another, have been deprived of all their legitimate rights; and they will remain so as long as this sort of relation continues. A common danger, or sometimes a common cause of hatred or love, is the bond that binds people together. By the same law that herds beasts of prey together, men also unite into a body and form a caste or a nation of their own. Zealous love for one's own people and country, showing itself in bitter hatred against another — as of Greece against Persia, or Rome against Carthage, of the Arab against the Kafir, of Spain against the Moor, of France against Spain, of England and Germany against France, and of America against England — is undoubtedly one of the main causes which lead to the advancement of one nation over another, by way of uniting itself in hostilities against another. Self-love is the first teacher of self-renunciation. For the preservation of the individual's interest only one looks first to the well-being of the whole. In the interest of one's own nation is one's own interest; in the well-being of one's own nation is one's own well-being. Without the co-operation of the many, most words can by no means go on — even self-defence becomes an impossibility. The joining of friendly hands in mutual help for the protection of this self-interest is seen in every nation, and in every land. Of course, the circumference of this self-interest varies with different people. To multiply and to have the opportunity of somehow dragging on a precarious existence, and over and above this, the condition that the religious pursuits of the higher castes may not suffer in any way, is of the highest gain and interest for Indians! For modern India, there is no better hope conceivable; this is the last rung of the ladder of India's life! The present government of India has certain evils attendant on it, and there are some very great and good parts in it as well. Of highest good is this, that after the fall of the Pâtaliputra Empire till now, India was never under the guidance of such a powerful machinery of government as the British, wielding the sceptre throughout the length and breadth of the land. And under this Vaishya supremacy, thanks to the strenuous enterprise natural to the Vaishya, as the objects of commerce are being brought from one end of the world to another, so at the same time, as its natural sequence, the ideas and thoughts of different countries are forcing their way into the very bone and marrow of India. Of these ideas and thoughts, some are really most beneficial to her, some are harmful, while others disclose the ignorance and inability of the foreigners to determine what is truly good for the inhabitants of this country. But piercing through the mass of whatever good or evil there may be is seen rising the sure emblem of India's future prosperity — that as the result of the action and reaction between her own old national ideals on the one hand, and the newly-introduced strange ideals of foreign nations on the other, she is slowly and gently awakening from her long deep sleep. Mistakes she will make, let her: there is no harm in that; in all our actions, errors and mistakes are our only teachers. Who commits mistaken the path of truth is attainable by him only. Trees never make mistakes, nor do stones fall into error; animals are hardly seen to transgress the fixed laws of nature; but man is prone to err, and it is man who becomes God-on-earth. If our every movement from the nursery to the death-bed, if our every thought from rising at day-break till retirement at midnight, be prescribed and laid down for us in minutest detail by others — and if the threat of the king's sword be brought into requisition to keep us within the iron grasp of those prescribed rules — then, what remains for us to think independently for ourselves? What makes a man a genius, a sage? Isn't it because he thinks, reasons, wills? Without exercise, the power of deep thinking is lost. Tamas prevails, the mind gets dull and inert, the spirit is brought down to the level of matter. Yet, even now, every religious preacher, every social leader is anxious to frame new laws and regulations for the guidance of society! Does the country stand in want of rules? Has it not enough of them? Under the oppression of rules, the whole nation is verging on its ruin — who stops to understand this? In the case of an absolute and arbitrary monarchy, the conquered race is not treated with so much contempt by the ruling power. Under such an absolute government, the rights of all subjects are equal, in other words, no one has any right to question or control the governing authority. So there remains very little room for special privileges of caste and the like. But where the monarchy is controlled by the voice of the ruling race, or a republican form of government rules the conquered race, there a wide distance is created between the ruling and the ruled; and the most part of that power, which, if employed solely for the well-being of the ruled classes, might have done immense good to them within a short time, is wasted by the government in its attempts and applications to keep the subject race under its entire control. Under the Roman Emperorship, foreign subjects were, for this very reason, happier than under the Republic of Rome. For this very reason, St. Paul, the Christian Apostle, though born of the conquered Jewish race, obtained permission to appeal to the Roman Emperor, Caesar, to judge of the charges laid against him[17] Because some individual Englishman may call us \"natives\" or \"riggers\" and hate us as uncivilized savages, we do not gain or lose by that. We, on account of caste distinctions, have among ourselves far stronger feelings of hatred and scorn against one another; and who can say that the Brahmins, if they get some foolish unenlightened Kshatriya king on their side, will not graciously try again to \"cut out the Shudras' tongues and chop off their limbs\"? That recently in Eastern Aryavarta, the different caste-people seem to develop a feeling of united sympathy amidst themselves with a view to ameliorating their present social condition — that in the Mahratta country, the Brahmins have begun to sing paeans in praise of the \"Marâthâ\" race — these, the lower castes cannot yet believe to be the outcome of pure disinterestedness. But gradually the idea is being formed in the minds of the English public that the passing away of the Indian Empire from their sway will end in imminent peril to the English nation, and be their ruin. So, by any means whatsoever, the supremacy of England must be maintained in India. The way to effect this, they think, is by keeping uppermost in the heart of every Indian the mighty prestige and glory of the British nation. It gives rise to both laughter and tears simultaneously to observe how this ludicrous and pitiful sentiment is gaining ground among the English, and how they are steadily extending their modus operandi for the carrying out of this sentiment into practice. It seems as if the Englishmen resident in India are forgetting that so long as that fortitude, that perseverance, and that intense national unity of purpose, by which Englishmen have earned this Indian Empire — and that ever wide-awake commercial genius aided by science' which has turned even India, the mother of all riches, into the principal mart of England — so long as these characteristics are not eliminated from their national life, their throne in India is unshakable. So long as these qualities are inherent in the British character, let thousands of such Indian Empires be lost, thousands will be earned again. But if the flow of the stream of those qualifier be retarded, shall an Empire be governed by the mere emblazoning of British prestige and glory? Therefore when such remarkable traits of character are still predominant in the English as a nation, it is utterly useless to spend so much energy and power for the mere preservation of meaningless \"prestige\". If that power were employed for the welfare of the subject-people, that, would certainly have been a great gain for both the ruling and the ruled races. It has been said before that India is slowly awakening through her friction with the outside nations; and as the result of this little awakening, is the appearance, to a certain extent, of free and independent thought in modern India. On one side is modern Western science, dazzling the eyes with the brilliancy of myriad suns and driving in the chariot of hard and fast facts collected by the application of tangible powers direct in their incision, on the other are the hopeful and strengthening traditions of her ancient forefathers, in the days when she was at the zenith of her glory — traditions that have been brought out of the pages of her history by the great sages of her own land and outside, that run for numberless years and centuries through her every vein with the quickening of life drawn from universal love — traditions that reveal unsurpassed valour, superhuman genius, and supreme spirituality, which are the envy of the gods — these inspire her with future hopes. On one side, rank materialism, plenitude of fortune, accumulation of gigantic power, and intense sense-pursuits have, through foreign literature, caused a tremendous stir; on the other, through the confounding din of all these discordant sounds, she hears, in low yet unmistakable accents, the heart-rending cries of her ancient gods, cutting her to the quick. There lie before her various strange luxuries introduced from the West — celestial drinks, costly well-served food, splendid apparel, magnificent palaces, new modes of conveyance, new manners, new fashions dressed in which moves about the well-educated girl in shameless freedom — all these are arousing unfelt desires. Again, the scene changes, and in its place appear, with stern presence, Sitâ, Sâvitri, austere religious vows, fastings, the forest retreat, the matted locks and orange garb of the semi-naked Sannyasin, Samâdhi and the search after the Self. On one side is the independence of Western societies based on self-interest; on the other is the extreme self-sacrifice of the Aryan society. In this violent conflict, is it strange that Indian society should be tossed up and down? Of the West, the goal is individual independence, the language money-making education, the means politics; of India, the goal is Mukti, the language the Veda, the means renunciation. For a time, Modern India thinks, as it were, I am ruining this worldly life of mine in vain expectation of uncertain spiritual welfare hereafter which has spread its fascination over one; and again, lo! spellbound she listens — On one side, new India is saying, \"We should have full freedom in the selection of husband and wife; because the marriage, in which are involved the happiness and misery of all our future life, we must have the right to determine according to our own free will.\" On the other, old India is dictating, \"Marriage is not for sense-enjoyment, but to perpetuate the race. This is the Indian conception of marriage. By the producing of children, you are contributing to, and are responsible for, the future good or evil of the society. Hence society has the right to dictate whom you shall marry and whom you shall not. That form of marriage obtains in society which is conducive most to its well-being; do you give up your desire of individual pleasure for the good of the many.\" On one side, new India is saying, \"If we only adopt Western ideas, Western language, Western food, Western dress, and Western manners, we shall be as strong and powerful as the Western nations\"; on the other, old India is saying, \"Fools! By imitation, other's ideas never become one's own; nothing, unless earned, is your own. Does the ass in the lion's skin become the lion?\" On one side, new India is saving, \"What the Western nations do is surely good, otherwise how did they become so great?\" On the other side, old India is saying, \"The flash of lightning is intensely bright, but only for a moment; look out, boys, it is dazzling your eyes. Beware! \" Have we not then to learn anything from the West? Must we not needs try and exert ourselves for better things? Are we perfect? Is our society entirely spotless, without any flaw. There are many things to learn, he must struggle for new and higher things till we die — struggle is the end of human life. Shri Ramakrishna used to say, \"As long as I live, so long do I learn.\" That man or that society which has nothing to learn is already in the jaws of death. Yes, learn we must many things from the West: but there are fears as well. A certain young man of little understanding used always to blame the Hindu Shâstras before Shri Ramakrishna. One day he praised the Bhagavad-Gita, on which Shri Ramakrishna said, \"Methinks, some European Pandit has praised the Gita, and so he has also followed suit.\" O India, this is your terrible danger. The spell of imitating the West is getting such a strong hold upon you that what is good or what is bad is no longer decided by reason, judgment, discrimination, or reference to the Shastras. Whatever ideas, whatever manners the white men praise or like are good; whatever things they dislike or censure are bad. Alas! what can be a more tangible proof of foolishness than this? The Western ladies move freely everywhere, therefore that is good; they choose for themselves their husbands, therefore that is the highest step of advancement; the Westerners disapprove of our dress, decorations, food, and ways of living, therefore they must be very bad; the Westerners condemn image-worship as sinful, surely then, image-worship is the greatest sin, there is no doubt of it! The Westerners say that worshipping a single Deity is fruitful of the highest spiritual good, therefore let us throw our gods and goddesses into the river Ganga! The Westerners hold caste distinctions to be obnoxious, therefore let all the different castes be jumbled into one! The Westerners say that child-marriage is the root of all evils, therefore that is also very bad, of a certainty it is! We are not discussing here whether these customs deserve continuance or rejection; but if the mere disapproval of the Westerners be the measure of the abominableness of our manners and customs, then it is our duty to raise our emphatic protest against it. The present writer has, to some extent, personal experience of Western society. His conviction resulting from such experience has been that there is such a wide divergence between the Western society and the Indian as regards the primal course and goal of each, that any sect in India, framed after the Western model, will miss the aim. We have not the least sympathy with those who, never leaving lived in Western society and, therefore, utterly ignorant of the rules and prohibitions regarding the association of men and women that obtain there, and which act as safeguards to preserve the purity of the Western women, allow a free rein to the unrestricted intermingling of men and women in our society. I have observed in the West also that the children of weaker nations, if born in England, give themselves out as Englishmen, instead of Greek, Portuguese, Spaniard, etc., as the case may be. All drift towards the strong. That the light of glory which shines in the glorious may anyhow fall and reflect on one's own body, i.e. to shine in the borrowed light of the great, is the one desire of the weak. When I see Indians dressed in European apparel and costumes, the thought comes to my mind, perhaps they feel ashamed to own their nationality and kinship with the ignorant, poor, illiterate, downtrodden people of India! Nourished by the blood of the Hindu for the last fourteen centuries, the Parsee is no longer a \"native\"! Before the arrogance of the casteless, who pretend to be and glorify themselves in being Brahmins, the true nobility of the old, heroic, high-class Brahmin melts into nothingness! Again, the Westerners have now taught us that those stupid, ignorant, low-caste millions of India, clad only in loin-cloths, are non-Aryans. They are therefore no more our kith and kin! O India! With this mere echoing of others, with this base imitation of others, with this dependence on others this slavish weakness, this vile detestable cruelty — wouldst thou, with these provisions only, scale the highest pinnacle of civilisation and greatness? Wouldst thou attain, by means of thy disgraceful cowardice, that freedom deserved only by the brave and the heroic? O India! Forget not that the ideal of thy womanhood is Sita, Savitri, Damayanti; forget not that the God thou worshippest is the great Ascetic of ascetics, the all-renouncing Shankara, the Lord of Umâ; forget not that thy marriage, thy wealth, thy life are not for sense-pleasure, are not for thy individual personal happiness; forget not that thou art born as a sacrifice to the Mother's altar; forget not that thy social order is but the reflex of the Infinite Universal Motherhood; forget not that the lower classes, the ignorant, the poor, the illiterate, the cobbler, the sweeper, are thy flesh and blood, thy brothers. Thou brave one, be bold, take courage, be proud that thou art an Indian, and proudly proclaim, \"I am an Indian, every Indian is my brother.\" Say, \"The ignorant Indian, the poor and destitute Indian, the Brahmin Indian, the Pariah Indian, is my brother.\" Thou, too, clad with but a rag round thy loins proudly proclaim at the top of thy voice: \"The Indian is my brother, the Indian is my life, India's gods and goddesses are my God. India's society is the cradle of my infancy, the pleasure-garden of my youth, the sacred heaven, the Varanasi of my old age.\" Say, brother: \"The soil of India is my highest heaven, the good of India is my good,\" and repeat and pray day and night, \"O Thou Lord of Gauri, O Thou Mother of the Universe, vouchsafe manliness unto me! O Thou Mother of Strength, take away my weakness, take away my unmanliness, and make me a Man!\" Download Download < The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda‎ | Volume 4‎ | Translation: Prose The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda by Swami VivekanandaVolume 4, Translation: Prose The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda Swami Vivekananda Swami Vivekananda Volume 4, Translation: Prose 77707 The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda — Volume 4, Translation: Prose Swami Vivekananda ↑ Vedic hymns uttered by the priests to invoke the Devas at the time of sacrifice. ↑ The men who perform sacrifices. ↑ The name of the Soma plant as commonly found in the Vedas.

একটি লুইসা রে রহস্য \nএই গল্পে  লুইসা রে নামে একজন সাংবাদিক রহস্য উদ্ঘাটন করে কিভাবে  হাইড্রা জিরো নামে পারমাণবিক চুল্লী, যা কিনা সোয়াননেকে দ্বীপে অবস্থিত এবং দুর্ঘটনাপ্রবণ, জোড় করে শুধুমাত্র মুনাফা লাভের জন্য সিবোর্ড পাওয়ার ইনক দ্বারা চালু করার চেষ্টা করা হচ্ছে। লুইসা রের বাবাও সাহসী সাংবাদিক ছিলেন এবং রুফুস সিক্সস্মিথ তাঁর কথা জানতেন। সেই সুত্রে সে লুইসা রেকে হাইড্রা জিরোর সত্যতা জানান। রুফুস সিক্সস্মিথই হাইড্রা জিরোর পর্যবেক্ষণ করেছিলেন এবং বুঝেছিলেন চুল্লীটি কতটা দুর্ঘটনাপ্রবণ এবং ওটা চালু করার বিরোধী ছিলেন। বিল স্মোক একজন পেশাদার খুনী, সে লয়েড হুকস, যে এনার্জী সেক্রেটারী ছিল, তার হয়ে কাজ করত। বিল স্মোক  সিবোর্ড পাওয়ার ইনকের সিইও  আলবার্টো গ্রিমাল্ডীর প্লেনে বোম রেখে তাকে হত্যা করে এবং এর ফলে লয়েড হুকস সিবোর্ড পাওয়ার ইনকের সিইও হয়ে যায়।  রুফুস সিক্সস্মিথকেও বিল স্মোক খুন করে এবং লুইসা রেকে হত্যা করার চেষ্টা করে। জো নেপিয়ের, যে সিবোর্ডের রক্ষী হিসাবে কাজ করত,  লুইসা রের বাবার প্রতি শ্রদ্ধাশীল ছিল, সে লুইসা রেকে বাঁচায় ও বিল স্মোককে হত্যা করে।\n\nলুইসা রে যে ঘরে  রুফুস সিক্সস্মিথ খুন হন সেই ঘর থেকে  রবার্ট ফ্রবিশারের লেখা কিছু চিঠি পায় এবং সেগুলো পড়ে ওগুলোর প্রতি আকর্ষণ অনুভব করে।\n\n টিমোথি ক্যাভেনডিসের ভয়ানক অগ্নিপরীক্ষা \nটিমোথি ক্যাভেনডিস একজন বই সম্পাদক, সে ডারমট \"ডাস্টার\" হগিন্সের  একটি বই  \"নাকল সান্ডউইচ\" প্রকাশ করে। ডারমট তার একজন পুস্তক সমালোচককে ব্যালকনি থেকে ছুঁড়ে ফেলে মেরে  ফেলে। এই ঘটনার ফলে ডারমটের বই বিক্রী বেড়ে যায় ও টিমোথির আয় বাড়ে। কিন্তু টিমোথির ঋণ এত ছিল যে সব মুনাফা শেষ হয়ে যায়। এদিকে ডারমট জেলে চলে যাওয়ায় তার মারকুটে ভাইরা টিমোথির কাছে টাকা দাবি করে। ওদের কাছ থেকে পালানোর জন্য টিমোথি তার নিজের ভাইয়ের কাছে সাহায্য চায়। টিমোথির ভাই ডেনহোম আগে থেকে টিমোথির উপর রেগে ছিল তার স্রী  জর্জেটের সঙ্গে টিমোথির পুরানো গোপন সম্পর্ক নিয়ে। ডেনহোম টিমোথিকে চালাকি করে একটি কঠোর বৃদ্ধাশ্রমে পাঠিয়ে দেয়। টিমোথি কিভাবে সেখান থেকে পালায় অন্যান্য কিছু সঙ্গীদের নিয়ে সেটাই এই গল্পে বলা হয়েছে।\n\nটিমোথি বৃদ্ধাশ্রমে যাওয়ার আগে \"অর্ধ-জীবন - একটি লুইসা রে রহস্য\" নামে একটি বই-এর অর্ধেক পান্ডুলিপি পায়, যেটা একজন লেখিকা তাকে পাঠায় বই হিসাবে প্রকাশের আশায়। পান্ডুলিপিটা ভুলবশত: টিমোথি বৃদ্ধাশ্রমে নিয়ে যায় এবং ওখানে ঘটনাসমুহ চলাকালীন পড়ে এবং গল্পটার প্রতি আকর্ষিত হয়।\n\n সনমি-৪৫১ এর শেষ নিবেদন \nসনমি-451 একজন ফ্যাব্রিকান্ট, যে জেনেটিক ইঞ্জিনিয়ারিং-এর দ্বারা জঠরপাত্রে জন্ম নেয় এবং পাপা সঙ্গ নামক রেস্তোরাতে দাসী হিসেবে কাজ করে। সনমি-৪৫১ পাপা সঙ্গ  থেকে মিস্টার  চ্যাঙ্গ নামে একজনের সাথে পালিয়ে ত্যামোসান বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়ে যায়। বুম-সুক কিম নামে এক  পিএইচ. ডির ছাত্রের তত্ত্বাবধানে প্রথমে তাকে রাখায় হয়, তার পর তাকে হায়-জু ইমের সঙ্গে রাখা হয়।  হায়-জু তাকে জানায় য়ে  বুম-সুক কিম-র পিএইচ. ডি থিসিসের অংশ হিসেবে পাপা সঙ্গের কর্মীদের খাবারে একধরনের ফর্মুলা মেশানো হয় যার ফলে সনমি-৪৫১  ও তার বান্ধবী ইউনা~৯৩৯-র মানসিক  উত্তরণ হয় এবং সনমি-৪৫১, শুদ্ধরক্ত, অর্থাং স্বাভাবিক মানুযের মতো ভাবতে শেখে। পরে হায়-জু তাকে জানায় সে নিজে আসলে একজন ইউনিয়নের লোক, যারা ইউন্যানিমিটি গোষ্ঠীর বিরোধী। ইউন্যানিমিটির লোকেরা কোম্পানিবাদ প্রতিষ্ঠিত করতে চাইত, এবং ইউনিয়ন গোষ্ঠী তার বিরোধিতা করত বলে  ইউনিয়নের লোকেদের সন্ত্রাসবাদী আখ্যা দেওয়া হত।  হায়-জু সনমি-৪৫১-কে দেখায় কিভাবে তাদের মতো ফ্যাব্রিকান্টদের খুন করে তাদের মাংসই ফেনা বানিয়ে তাদেরই, পাপা সঙ্গের কর্মীদের, খাওয়ানো হয়। এসব জানার পর  সনমি-৪৫১ ইচ্ছে করে ইউন্যানিমিটির হাতে ধরা দেয় এবং তাদেরই মাধ্যমে নিজের লেখা কয়েক দফা ঘোষণাপত্র প্রকাশ করে যার মাধ্যমে সে মনে করে পরবর্তীকালে বিপ্লব আসবে।\nপুরো ঘটনাটা সনমি-৪৫১ এবং একজন আর্কিভিস্টের কথোপকথন হিসেবে দেখানো হয়েছে যা ওরিসন নামে যন্ত্রে সংরক্ষিত হয়।\n\nবিশ্ববিদ্যালয়ে থাকাকালীন হায়-জু  সনমি-৪৫১ কে বহু বছর আগেকার একটি সিনেমা দেখায় যার নাম \"টিমোথি ক্যাভেনডিসের ভয়ানক অগ্নিপরীক্ষা\"। সনমির সিনেমাটি ভীষন ভালো লাগে এবং সুখের অনুভূতি পায় এবং আর্কিভিস্টের কাছে সিনেমাটির শেষ দেখার শেষ ইচ্ছা প্রকাশ করে।\n\nশ্লুশার মোড় এবং পরবর্তী যা কিছু\nএ গল্পের মুখ্য চরিত্র হল জ্যাকরি, একজন উপত্যকাবাসী, ও মেরোনিম , একজন প্রিসিয়েন্ট। মেরোনিম জানায় যে পুরান কালে মানুষ সভ্যতার চুড়ান্তে পৌঁছালেও অতিরিক্ত ক্ষীদে মেটানোর জন্য বর্বর জাতিতে পরিনত হয় এবং পরিবেশ অত্যন্ত দূষিত হয়ে ওঠে। \"চরম পতন\"-এর সময় কিছু তার মতো মানুষ প্রিসিয়েন্স-এ অবতরণ করে। ৫ দশক পরে প্রিসিয়েন্টরা আবার খুঁজে বেড়ায় যদি পৃথিবীতে এখনও কোন সভ্যতা বেঁচে থাকে। কিন্তু তারা একমাত্র \"নয় উপত্যকা\", যেখানে জ্যাকরি বাস করত, সেখানই কিছু মানুষের সন্ধান পায়। মেরোনিম জ্যাকরির সাহায্যে পুরানো সময়ের জ্যোতির্বিদের পর্যবেক্ষণকেন্দ্র খুঁজে বার করে, যেখানে জ্যাকরিরা মনে করত \"পুরানো জর্জী\" নামে এক ভৌতিক জীব বাস করত। \"নয় উপত্যকা\"-তে কোনা নামে এক বর্বর জাতিও বাস করত, তারা জ্যাকরির ছোটবেলায় তার বাবাকে  খুন করে ও জ্যাকরির ভাইকে বন্দী করে নিয়ে যায়।  কোনারা পরবর্তীকালে জ্যাকরির পুরো গ্রামে আক্রমণ চালায় ও সবাইকে বন্দী বানায় বা খুন করে। মেরোনিম জ্যাকরিকে কোনাদের হাতে পরা থেকে বাঁচায় এবং নিজের সঙ্গে প্রিসিয়েন্সে নিয়ে যায়।\n\nজ্যাকরিরা সনমি নামে দেবতার আরাধনা করত। জ্যাকরি মেরোনিমের কাছে থাকা একরকম যন্ত্রে একটি মেয়ের ছবি দেখতে পায়। মেরোনিম জানায় যে ওটা সনমিরই ছবি। সে বলে যে সনমি একজন দু:খী বিকৃতজন্মা মানুষ ছিল, তাকে শুদ্ধরক্তরা হত্যা করে। তাঁর মৃত্যুর পরই তাঁর আদর্শ শুদ্ধরক্ত ও বিকৃতজন্মা সব মানুষের চিন্তাধারায় প্রবেশ করে। মেরোনিম জানায় সনমির জীবন বৃত্তান্ত নিয়ে পড়াশুনা করছিল বলে তার ওরিসন যন্ত্রে সনমির ছবি রাখা ছিল।", "references": []}, {"title": "Introduction", "content": "ক্লাউড অ্যাটলাস (ইংরেজি: Cloud Atlas) ইংরেজ ঔপন্যাসিক ডেভিড মিশেল রচিত একটি ব্যতিক্রমী কাঠামোর উপন্যাস। গ্রন্থটি ২০০৪ খ্রিস্টাব্দের মার্চ মাসে প্রকাশনা সংস্থা \"স্কেপ্টার\" কর্তৃক প্রকাশিত হয়। ৫৪৪ পৃষ্ঠার এই সুপরিসর উপন্যাস ছয়টি পৃথক কাহিনীর সমবায়ে গঠিত যার প্রতিটি পাঠককে দেয় উত্তুঙ্গ শ্বাসরূদ্ধকর অভিজ্ঞতা; সবশেষে প্রতিটি কাহিনীর আগ্রহসঞ্চারী সন্নিপাত পাঠকের হৃদয়ে সৃষ্টি করে গভীর তৃপ্তি। লেখকের বৈশিষ্ট্য হলো ছয়টি গল্পের প্রতিটিই ভিন্ন ভিন্ন কালে, ভিন্ন ভিন্ন স্থানে স্থাপিত; এমনকী প্রতিটির জন্য লেখক ভিন্ন ভাষা-ভঙ্গী অবলম্বন করে নতুন এক স্বাদ সৃষ্টি করেছেন।ব্রিটেনের দ্য গার্ডিয়ান পত্রিকায় প্রকাশিত গ্রন্থালোচনা এই উপন্যাসটি ২০০৪-এ বুকার পুরস্কার-এর জন্য মনোনয়ন লাভ করেছিল। এটি লেখকের তৃতীয় উপন্যাস। প্যারিস রিভিয়্যু পত্রিকার আলোচনা", "references": [" Cloud Atlas by David Mitchell 544pp, Sceptre, £16.99 David Mitchell entices his readers on to a rollercoaster, and at first they wonder if they want to get off.

But unlike these, he starts his next tale in another place, in another time, in another vocabulary, and expects us to go through it all again. Trust the tale. He reaches a cumulative ending of all of them, and then finishes them all individually, giving a complete narrative pleasure that is rare. The first tale is about a 19th-century American lawyer, Adam Ewing, crossing the Pacific in 1850, meeting Maoris and missionaries, a seedy English physician and some nasty sailors. The second is about a young British composer in 1931, who cons a dying genius into taking him on as an amanuensis, and then makes love to his wife and daughter. This narrator, Robert Frobisher, composes the Cloud Atlas Sextet \"for overlapping soloists\" on piano, clarinet, cello, flute, oboe and violin, \"each in its own language of key, scale and colour\". Frobisher's tale is told in a series of letters to his lover, Rufus Sixsmith, who later appears as a nuclear scientist in Reagan's California in the 1970s. This Californian thriller is the tale of Luisa Rey, a journalist who uncovers a corporate nuclear scandal and is at constant risk of assassination. The fourth voice is Timothy Cavendish, a 1980s London vanity publisher, trapped in an old people's home near Hull. The fifth is the pre-execution testimony of Sonmi-451, a cloned slave in some future state, who has acquired intelligence and vision. The sixth, and central one, is the storytelling voice of Zachry, a tribesman after the fall of the civilised world, who is back in the Pacific islands where the linear narrative began. The novel opens with one ship - the Prophetess - and ends with another ship that contains the survivors of Civ'lise, the Prescients. The stories are all very intensely first person - apart from \"Half-Lives - the First Luisa Rey Mystery\". Each has a charac ter with a birthmark like a comet, as though they might be different incarnations of the same soul or different forms of the same cloud of molecules, as we all are. They are linked by other artifices - Frobisher finds both parts of Adam Ewing's Pacific diary; Luisa Rey acquires both Frobisher's letters and a rare gramophone record of the Sextet ; Cavendish is sent \"The First Luisa Rey Mystery\" by its author; Sonmi's dying request is to watch an old half-viewed film of \"The Ghastly Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish\", to see what happened. Sonmi herself has become the goddess of the Valley Tribes of Zachry, although the Prescients - who have preserved a hologram of her \"orison\", or recorded testimony - say she was a \"freakbirthed human who died hun'erds o years ago\". Cloud Atlas is powerful and elegant because of Mitchell's understanding of the way we respond to those fundamental and primitive stories we tell about good and evil, love and destruction, beginnings and ends. He isn't afraid to jerk tears or ratchet up suspense - he understands that's what we make stories for. Cavendish, considering \"The First Luisa Rey Mystery\", imagines a critic saying: \"But it's been done a thousand times before\", and snarls to himself, \"as if there could be anything not done a hundred thousand times between Aristophanes and Andrew Void-Webber! As if Art is the What, not the How!\" This is a half-truth - Cavendish has the limitations of his place in culture, history and this novel - but it does associate works of art, and novels, with the eternal recurrences of culture and human nature. Mitchell is indeed both doing what has been done a hundred thousand times before and doing it differently. He plays delicious games with other people's voices, ideas and characters. Adam Ewing has his secret sharer and his Billy Budd. Frobisher is an amoral aesthete out of Waugh and Powell, and Vyvyan Ayres, his elderly host and slave-driver, quotes Nietzsche with nasty, decadent charm. Cavendish is nasty (and insinuatingly sympathetic) in the way of the Amises and Burgess's Enderby, snarling with wit about disasters of transport and bodily malfunction. \"Luisa Rey\" is interesting because it uses the clichés of the Chandler world of good cop against bad power, exacts the simple response with which we would read such a tale - narrative greed, simplified fear and sympathy - and at the same time (because of the context it is in) is more moving than it would be on its own. Luisa describes an interview she did with Hitchcock (who, she says, described his own works as rollercoasters), in which she \"put it to the great man, the key to fictitious terror is partition or containment: so long as the Bates Motel is sealed off from our world, we want to peer in, like at a scorpion enclosure. But a film that shows the world is a Bates Motel, well, that's ... the stuff of Buchloe, dystopia, depression.\" This observation is something that Mitchell understands and exploits - using the word partition in both its musical and fencing sense, to make a distance between us and the tense dramas and horrors he describes, to make us see everything. Sunt lacrimae rerum, as Frobisher says at the end of his tale. Another paradigm we are offered is the idea of another character, a scientist - shortly before he is blown to bits - that we exist for a brief moment inside a shell (like Russian dolls) of virtual pasts, one of which is also the real past, and another of virtual futures, one of which is the real future. \"Half-Lives\" is a knowing title, radiation and fiction combined. Fictive people are ghosts. The ghosts of the virtual future, paradoxically, have to be more concrete than those of the pasts, written and real, that we already know. Sonmi's Nea So Copros and Zachry's Sloosha's Crossin' are both recognisable dystopias, one technological and political (in the tradition of Orwell, Huxley, Alasdair Gray), the other post-technological primitivism (as in Riddley Walker, Golding, Ursula le Guin); and both work because of the joyful amplitude of Mitchell's inventiveness. He is good at imagining the details of these hypothetical lives - not only the food and the rituals, but the moral atmospheres and the automatic assumptions. But his great feat is the variation in rhythms, which sweeps away any readerly objection to yet another brave new world. Sonmi, the fabricant who learns nakedly and from scratch to think and feel, is oddly the most intelligent of all the characters. Zachry's rhythm of tribal anecdote is the most compelling. These two use old words and invented new ones which are a delight. Cloud Atlas asks the simple questions of our own time, which has a Darwinian vision. A missionary explains to Adam Ewing, son of the American revolution, his idea of a \"ladder of civilisation\" that will extinguish those races unable to join progress. Zachry's tribesmen believe Sonmi was \"birthed by a god o' Smart named Darwin\". Humans, someone says, have the intelligence of gods and the souls of jackals. Greed will destroy the world. Ewing, at the end of the book which is close to its beginning, as it has come full circle, sees the \"natural\" ideas of dominance and fitness as \"the entropy written within our nature\". He has saved the life of the last Moriori tribesman, whose peaceable family were destroyed by Maori warriors. The Moriori saves him, and individual acts of heroism and rescue stand against tooth and claw across the narrative web. Ewing goes back to become an abolitionist. Sonmi is a (briefly) freed slave whose presence has its half-life after defeat. Zachry becomes again the last of his peaceful tribe, and its storytelling memory. Ewing also says that \"Belief is both prize and battlefield\", and what Mitchell does is embody simple beliefs and make them vital and important. Luisa is named after Thornton Wilder's The Bridge of San Luis Rey, another tale of lives brought together in time and significance by convergent fates. It is a tougher, sparser book than I had remembered, and I had forgotten the character of the priest, who tries to find God's providence in the accidental deaths and is burned for blasphemy. There are recurrent abbesses in Cloud Atlas who resemble the abbess in Wilder's book, who watches over the harmed and the hurt. Both books can be read both ways - there is a hidden order, mimicked by, or revealed by, art, which makes sense of our brief lives. Or perhaps there is not any order, except at the molecular level. Perhaps there is only kindness and tears. · AS Byatt's Little Black Book of Stories was published by Chatto last year.

Zachry's tribesmen believe Sonmi was \"birthed by a god o' Smart named Darwin\". Humans, someone says, have the intelligence of gods and the souls of jackals. Greed will destroy the world. Ewing, at the end of the book which is close to its beginning, as it has come full circle, sees the \"natural\" ideas of dominance and fitness as \"the entropy written within our nature\". He has saved the life of the last Moriori tribesman, whose peaceable family were destroyed by Maori warriors. The Moriori saves him, and individual acts of heroism and rescue stand against tooth and claw across the narrative web. Ewing goes back to become an abolitionist. Sonmi is a (briefly) freed slave whose presence has its half-life after defeat. Zachry becomes again the last of his peaceful tribe, and its storytelling memory. Ewing also says that \"Belief is both prize and battlefield\", and what Mitchell does is embody simple beliefs and make them vital and important. Luisa is named after Thornton Wilder's The Bridge of San Luis Rey, another tale of lives brought together in time and significance by convergent fates. It is a tougher, sparser book than I had remembered, and I had forgotten the character of the priest, who tries to find God's providence in the accidental deaths and is burned for blasphemy. There are recurrent abbesses in Cloud Atlas who resemble the abbess in Wilder's book, who watches over the harmed and the hurt. Both books can be read both ways - there is a hidden order, mimicked by, or revealed by, art, which makes sense of our brief lives. Or perhaps there is not any order, except at the molecular level. Perhaps there is only kindness and tears. · AS Byatt's Little Black Book of Stories was published by Chatto last year.TopicsBooksFictionAS ByattDavid MitchellCloud AtlasreviewsReuse this content Advertisement US editionUS editionUK editionAustralian editionInternational edition The Guardian - Back to home The Guardian: news website of the year Show More Show More Books Books Buy Cloud Atlas at Amazon.co.uk Buy Cloud Atlas at Amazon.co.uk Buy Cloud Atlas at Amazon.co.uk Buy Cloud Atlas at Amazon.co.uk Topics Most popular Books Back to top ", " The early life of David Mitchell, spent in the town of Malvern in Worcestershire, England, was ordinary and uneventful—as he puts it, “white, straight, and middle-class.” Things got more exciting when, at twenty-four, he fell in love with a Japanese woman and moved to Hiroshima. Six years later he published his first novel, Ghostwritten (1999), which A. S. Byatt declared one of the best first novels she’d read. It was awarded the John Llewellyn Rhys Prize for the best work of literature by a British or Commonwealth author thirty-five or younger. Both his second novel, Number9Dream (2001), and his third, Cloud Atlas (2004), were short-listed for the Booker Prize; Granta picked him as one of the best young British novelists; and Time magazine, following the publication of his fourth novel, Black Swan Green (2006), chose him as the only literary novelist in their 2007 list of the one hundred most influential people in the world. His new book, The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet, is a rich and absorbing historical novel set in Japan at the very end of the eighteenth century, in Dejima, a walled artificial island in Nagasaki Harbor that was the only place in the country where Westerners were tolerated. All five novels are ambitious, formally complex, imaginatively powerful, and immaculately written. They zigzag across the globe, across centuries, skipping from genre to genre with a restless, openhearted intelligence. Despite the critical adulation, Mitchell remains modest, polite, and friendly. Eager to laugh, he brims with boyish enthusiasm. He dresses like a slacker, in baggy jeans and layered T-shirts, and the clothes add to the youthful aura—as do his close-cropped reddish-blond hair; his long, lanky frame; and his translucent, stick-out ears. Because he skirts around it with considerable lexical ingenuity, it’s not immediately apparent that he stammers. After returning from Japan in 2002, Mitchell settled in Clonakilty, a seaside town in County Cork, Ireland. He and his wife have a daughter and a son. Most of this interview was conducted in the cramped and cluttered upstairs parlor of O’Donovan’s Hotel in Clonakilty, with breaks to eat lamb burgers in a nearby restaurant. We also met at Hazlitt’s Hotel in London, which has a fine eighteenth-century pedigree—a fitting venue for an interview with a man who has spent his last half decade living in the year 1799. INTERVIEWER Do you have any form of ritual preparation before writing? DAVID MITCHELL Absolutely not. I can write pretty much anywhere. If I’m in a loud place where I know the language, then I can’t write, but generally the universe needs to contrive circumstances to stop me writing, rather than contrive ones to allow me to write. But I am happiest in my hut in County Cork, with a pot of green tea and a large, uncluttered table. INTERVIEWER If you’re in your hut with your teapot and cup, are you writing on your laptop, or longhand? MITCHELL I do my thinking on paper, and act on my thinking on the laptop. INTERVIEWER What are you working on now? MITCHELL Right now I’m working on a book set in the thirty years on either side of 2010, but I shouldn’t give too many details or the next thing you know it’s on Wikipedia and if I change my mind and decide to recast King Lear in a pond of frogs and toads I’ll just give a hardworking Wikipedian an extra headache. INTERVIEWER Can you remember when you first knew you wanted to be a writer? MITCHELL There was no single epiphany, but I recall a few early flashes. When I was ten I would be transported by certain books—Ursula K. Le Guin’s Earthsea trilogy, Susan Cooper’s fantasy novels, Isaac Asimov—and burn to do to readers what had just been done to me. Sometimes that burning prompted me to start writing, though I never got more than a few pages down. A few years later I would indulge in a visual fantasy that involved imagining my name on the jacket of a book—usually Faber and Faber—and I’d feel a whoosh inside my rib cage. INTERVIEWER Did you confess these desires to anyone? MITCHELL When I was thirteen I boasted to my mother that I was writing a book. She replied, Oh, well, that’s no surprise. I was crestfallen. INTERVIEWER Did your parents have literary interests? MITCHELL My father taught art at a teacher-training college before joining the design department of Royal Worcester Porcelain, where he worked on tableware and limited editions—I remember a series with famous American ships, which people might still be dining off in Omaha or Santa Cruz as we speak. Mum was a freelance artist specializing in botanical images used in advertising, packaging, and on greetings cards. When I talk about my artist parents people imagine a bohemian environment and think, Aha, so that’s where he gets it from! But we were as white, straight, and middle-class as the next family on our white, straight, middle-class housing estate. But my parents did show me, inadvertently, that earning a living off the back of an artistic talent is not impossible. And certainly there was no shortage of books in the house—Mum was always a big reader, and still is—and my childhood was a place where reading for pleasure was not weird. Also, my parents discovered they could shut me up for hours by mounting a large piece of cartridge paper on a drawing board—beautiful quality paper, a big beautiful snowy expanse—and leave me to draw, and name, maps of imaginary archipelagos and continents. Those maps, I think, were my protonovels. I was reading Tolkien, and it was the maps as much as the text that floated my boat. What was happening behind these mountains where Frodo and company never went? What about the town along the edge of the sea? What kind of people lived there? The empty spaces required me to turn anthropologist-creator. INTERVIEWER How different was your childhood from the rather traumatic one you give Jason Taylor in Black Swan Green? MITCHELL My mum and dad were much nicer than the parents in Black Swan Green, and I wasn’t picked on the way Jason was. My stammer was less extreme. Link your subscription Forgot password?

Jamaica Kincaid was born Elaine Potter Richardson on Antigua in 1949. When she was sixteen, her family interrupted her education, sending her to work as a nanny in New York. In time, she put herself on another path. She went from the New School in Manhattan to Franconia College in New Hampshire, and worked at Magnum Photos and at the teen magazine Ingenue. In the mid-’70s, she began to write for The Village Voice, but it was at The New Yorker, where she became a regular columnist for the Talk of the Town section, that everything changed for her. Her early fiction, much of which also appeared in that magazine, was collected in At the Bottom of the River (1983), a book that, like her Talk stories, announced her themes, her style, the uncanny purity of her prose. She has published the novels Annie John (1985), Lucy (1990), The Autobiography of My Mother (1996), Mr. Potter (2002), and See Now Then (2013). A children’s book, Annie, Gwen, Lilly, Pam and Tulip, came out in 1986. Aside from the collected Talk Stories (2001), her nonfiction works include A Small Place (1988), a reckoning with the colonial legacy on Antigua; My Brother (1997), a memoir of the tragedy of AIDS in her family; and two books on gardening, My Garden (Book) (1999) and Among Flowers: A Walk in the Himalaya (2005). Kincaid divides her time between Cambridge, Massachusetts, where she is a professor of African American studies at Harvard University, and Bennington, Vermont, where her large brown clapboard house with yellow window trim is shielded by trees. She has two children from her marriage to the composer Allen Shawn, the son of the former New Yorker editor William Shawn, and in the living room she displays on a table—proudly, apologetically—productions from the arts-and-crafts camps and classes that her son and daughter attended over the years. The study where she writes is a sunroom surrounded on three sides by windows. The terrace that starts at the back door ends in a border of stones; the lawn, planted with thousands of daffodils, slopes down to a thickly shaded creek. Nearby are a vegetable garden caged against wildlife and a cottage in which lives Trevor, her bearded young assistant. Over some twenty years, Kincaid has made what my partner, the poet James Fenton, calls a “plantsman’s garden,” full of rare species. Her hundreds of plants are layered into a composition of informal design, expressive of her refined aesthetic and untroubled eccentricity. She has plants that move her because of how they look or how they behave, or because of their histories. This conversation began at a public event at the 92nd Street Y in 2013, and was picked up again in her Vermont kitchen eight years later, in the summer of 2021, when the social restrictions of the pandemic had, for a time, eased. Jamaica Kincaid is a generous host. She cooks with flair. Her big, broad-frame glasses evoke the Italian movie stars of the sixties. The years have gone by, but she is still tall. Her voice is as musical as ever, high-pitched, the Anglo-Caribbean lilt beguiling. She is a presence; everything begins to happen when she talks. In person and on the page, Kincaid’s is a literary voice. She is alive to the advantage in the irony that her literary heritage had not predicted her, exalted, brave, free. INTERVIEWER Why did your family send you to America? Wasn’t London still a capital of empire in the mid-’60s, the cultural center of the Commonwealth? JAMAICA KINCAID If they’d known anyone in London, they would have sent me there. But they didn’t have any long-term plan in mind. The idea wasn’t that I would establish myself and then have the rest of my family join me. I was simply sent away to support them. My father—my stepfather—had gotten ill, and my parents had three boy children. The arrival of my youngest brother had plunged us into a kind of poverty we’d never known. It used to be a tradition in agricultural families that you’d sacrifice the eldest child. I remember the darkness of being sent away—sheer misery of a kind that I didn’t know existed. Until then homesickness was something I only knew from books. I think I first came across it in one of the Brontës. INTERVIEWER So there wasn’t any excitement in it? KINCAID Not at all, because I was going as a servant. I remember walking in the hot sun to one of the American bases in Antigua—past the crazy house, as we called the lunatic asylum, and the dead house, where the bodies of people who died in the hospital were put until they were collected by the undertaker—to be interviewed by an American soldier’s wife. I was very bitter about it because I had before me what seemed to be a successful future. I might have gone to the University of the West Indies. I would have gotten a scholarship. It seemed cruel even to other people because I was known as what we called a “bright child.” No, there wasn’t any cause for celebration, though my mother did make me a new dress and see me off to the airport. INTERVIEWER Homesickness—this kind of interrupted love—is a big element in your work. KINCAID Well, perhaps, but I never really felt I belonged even in Antigua, even when I was little. My mother came from Dominica, and the thing about those little islands is that people from one island or the other don’t like each other. She was an outsider in Antigua, and she looked different. She was part Carib Indian, and they used to call her the Red Woman. I suppose that my work is always mourning something, the loss of a paradise—not the thing that comes after you die, but the thing that you had before. I often think of the time before my brothers were born—and this might sound very childish, but I don’t care—as this paradise of my mother and me always being together. There were times when my mother and I would go swimming and she would disappear for a second, and I would imagine the depths just rolling over her, that she’d go deeper and deeper and I’d never see her again . . . And then she would pop up somewhere else. Those memories are a constant source of some strange pleasure for me. I was pulled out of school to take care of my youngest brother while my mother went to work, and when she realized I hadn’t been looking after him properly, that I had been reading instead, she gathered all the books I had stolen from the library over the years and burned them. You can probably tell from my writing that I’m obsessed with notions of justice and injustice—those things that are wrong that can never be made right. Nowadays if I were to be homesick it would be for Vermont, which is strange. But perhaps it makes sense—I grew up in a place where I saw the sea every day and, near the end of my life, I’m living in a place where the water has run out. INTERVIEWER Did Lucy come out of a feeling that you needed to put your arrival to America in its place somehow—to examine it, or to leave it behind? KINCAID Not so much to put anything in its place as to give an account of what had happened to me. Lucy is about the making of a person. You can see in it the sentimentality of Jane Eyre. A sense of, I’m all alone in the world, and I have integrity. You might want this, but I will do that. Lucy stops sending her salary home, and I did stop sending mine. I still have the clothes I bought at Bonwit Teller. I was the best-dressed nanny you ever saw. INTERVIEWER Were you refashioning yourself? KINCAID I loved dressing up and going out. You might say that was the influence of my mother. By the time my youngest brother was born her life had collapsed on her, but she was a very elegant woman when I was young. I used to be ashamed to be seen with her because she was so sexy—men of all ages would stop her and talk to her. I remember she wore her hair in a French roll, and she wore what they called a hobble skirt. After I moved to New York, I modeled for people like Steven Meisel. I clearly had one of those eating problems, but I didn’t know what they were. I didn’t know that there was anything about me that had a name, that could be diagnosed. I ended up smoking Lucky Strikes, just because I liked the way it looked, the gesture. For some reason, I decided to cut off my hair and bleach it blond. I dressed in old clothes, thrift-shop clothes. I styled myself to look like no one else. And I also knew I didn’t want to write like anyone else. When I started writing Talk pieces at The New Yorker, I tried to get away from the anonymous “we” they used. They had very good writers, but they were these old, stout white men. I hated the we. I had such contempt for a certain kind of writing, which I would now call “white writing.” It was so dull and mannered. Rachel Cusk photo courtesy the author.

INTERVIEWER Did Lucy come out of a feeling that you needed to put your arrival to America in its place somehow—to examine it, or to leave it behind? KINCAID Not so much to put anything in its place as to give an account of what had happened to me. Lucy is about the making of a person. You can see in it the sentimentality of Jane Eyre. A sense of, I’m all alone in the world, and I have integrity. You might want this, but I will do that. Lucy stops sending her salary home, and I did stop sending mine. I still have the clothes I bought at Bonwit Teller. I was the best-dressed nanny you ever saw. INTERVIEWER Were you refashioning yourself? KINCAID I loved dressing up and going out. You might say that was the influence of my mother. By the time my youngest brother was born her life had collapsed on her, but she was a very elegant woman when I was young. I used to be ashamed to be seen with her because she was so sexy—men of all ages would stop her and talk to her. I remember she wore her hair in a French roll, and she wore what they called a hobble skirt. After I moved to New York, I modeled for people like Steven Meisel. I clearly had one of those eating problems, but I didn’t know what they were. I didn’t know that there was anything about me that had a name, that could be diagnosed. I ended up smoking Lucky Strikes, just because I liked the way it looked, the gesture. For some reason, I decided to cut off my hair and bleach it blond. I dressed in old clothes, thrift-shop clothes. I styled myself to look like no one else. And I also knew I didn’t want to write like anyone else. When I started writing Talk pieces at The New Yorker, I tried to get away from the anonymous “we” they used. They had very good writers, but they were these old, stout white men. I hated the we. I had such contempt for a certain kind of writing, which I would now call “white writing.” It was so dull and mannered. From the Archive, Issue 239 Interview Aisha Sabatini Sloan Episode 22: “Form and Formlessness” , November 2021 In an essay specially commissioned for the podcast, Aisha Sabatini Sloan describes rambling around Paris with her father, Lester Sloan, a longtime staff photographer for Newsweek, and a glamorous woman who befriends them. In an excerpt from The Art of Fiction no. 246, Rachel Cusk and Sheila Heti discuss how writing her first novel helped Cusk discover her “shape or identity or essence.” Next, Allan Gurganus’s reading of his story “It Had Wings,” about an arthritic woman who finds a fallen angel in her backyard, is interspersed with a version of the story rendered as a one-woman opera by the composer Bruce Saylor. The episode closes with “Dear Someone,” a poem by Deborah Landau. Rachel Cusk photo courtesy the author.

In these Lenin called for Soviet control of the state. When published the theses contributed to the July Days rising and to the subsequent coup d'etat of October 1917, bringing the Bolsheviks to power. I have outlined a few theses which I shall supply with some commentaries. I could not, because of the lack of time, present a thorough, systematic report. The basic question is our attitude towards the war. The basic things confronting you as you read about Russia or observe conditions here are the triumph of defencism, the triumph of the traitors to Socialism, the deception of the masses by the bourgeoisie... The new government, like the preceding one, is imperialistic, despite the promise of a republic - it is imperialistic through and through. In our attitude toward the war not the slightest concession must be made to \"revolutionary defencism,\" for under the new government of Lvov & Co., owing to the capitalise nature of this government, the war on Russia's part remains a predatory imperialist war. In view of the undoubted honesty of the mass of rank and file representatives of revolutionary defencism who accept the war only as a necessity and not as a means of conquest, in view of their being deceived by the bourgeoisie, it is necessary most thoroughly, persistently, patiently to explain to them their error, to explain the inseparable connection between capital and the imperialist war, to prove that without the overthrow of capital it is impossible to conclude the war with a really democratic, non-oppressive peace. This view is to be widely propagated among the army units in the field... The peculiarity of the present situation in Russia is that it represents a transition from the first stage of the revolution - which, because of the inadequate organisation and insufficient class-consciousness of the proletariat, led to the assumption of power by the bourgeoisie - to its second stage which is to place power in the hands of the proletariat and the poorest strata of the peasantry... This peculiar situation demands of us an ability to adapt ourselves to the specific conditions of party work amidst vast masses of the proletariat just wakened to political life. No support to the Provisional Government; exposure of the utter falsity of all its promises, particularly those relating to the renunciation of annexations. Unmasking, instead of admitting, the illusion-breeding \"demand\" that this government, a government of capitalist, should cease to be imperialistic... Recognition of the fact that in most of the Soviets of Workers' Deputies our party constitutes a minority, and a small one at that, in the face of the bloc of all the petty bourgeois opportunist elements... who have yielded to the influence of the bourgeoisie... It must be explained to the masses that the Soviet of Workers' Deputies is the only possible form of revolutionary government and that, therefore, our task is, while this government is submitting to the influence of the bourgeoisie, to present a patient, systematic, and persistent analysis of its errors and tactics, an analysis especially adapted to the practical needs of the masses... Not a parliamentary republic - a return to it from the Soviet of Workers' Deputies would be a step backward - but a republic of Soviets of Workers', Agricultural Labourers' and Peasants' Deputies throughout the land, from top to bottom. Abolition of the police, the army, the bureaucracy... All officers to be elected and to be subject to recall at any time, their salaries not to exceed the average wage of a competent worker... In the agrarian programme, the emphasis must be shifted to the Soviets of Agricultural Labourers' Deputies. Confiscation of private lands. Nationalisation of all lands in the country, and management of such lands by local Soviets of Agricultural Labourers' and Peasants' Deputies. A separate organisation of Soviets of Deputies of the poorest peasants. Creation of model agricultural establishments out of large estates... Immediate merger of all the banks in the country into one general national bank, over which the Soviet of Workers' Deputies should have control... Not the \"introduction\" of Socialism as an immediate task, but the immediate placing of the Soviet of Workers' Deputies in control of social production and distribution of goods... Party tasks: Rebuilding the International. Taking the initiative in the creation of a revolutionary International, an International against the social-chauvinists and against the \"centre\"...

Bengali is native to the region of eastern South Asia known as Bengal, which comprises present day Bangladesh and the Indian state of West Bengal. With nearly 230 million native speakers, Bengali is one of the most widely spoken languages in the world (it is ranked 5th in the world). Bengali is the main language spoken in Bangladesh; in India, Bengali is ranked as the second most spoken language. Along with Assamese, it is geographically the most eastern of the Indo-European languages. History Like many other Eastern Indo-Aryan languages, Bengali arose from the Magadhi Apabhramsha melting pot of Middle Indic languages, around the turn of the first millennium CE. Some argue for much earlier points of divergence - going back to even 500 CE, but the language wasn't static; different varieties coexisted and authors often wrote in multiple dialects. For example, Magadhi Apabhramsha is believed to have evolved into Magadhi Abahatta around the 6th century which competed with Bengali for a period of time. Usually 3 periods are identified in the history of Bengali: Old Bengali (900/1000 CE1400 CE) texts include Charyapada, devotional songs; emergence of pronouns Ami, tumi, etc; verb inflections -ila, -iba, etc. Oriya and Assamese branch out in this period. Middle Bengali (14001800 CE) - major texts of the period include Chandidas's Srikrishnakirtan; elision of word-final ô sound; spread of compound verbs; Persian influence. Some scholars further divide this period into early and late middle periods. New Bengali (since 1800 CE) - shortening of verbs and pronouns, among other changes (e.g. tahar tar 'his'/'her'; koriyachhilô korechhilo he/she had done). Historically closer to Pali, Bengali saw an increase in Sanskrit influence during the Middle Bengali (Chaitanya era), and also during the Bengal Renaissance. Of the modern Indo-European languages in South Asia, Bengali and Marathi retain a largely Sanskrit vocabulary base while Hindi and others are more influenced by Arabic and Persian. Until the 18th century, there was no attempt to document the grammar for Bengali. The first written Bengali dictionary 'Vocabolario em idioma Bengalla, e Portuguez dividido em duas partes' was written by the Portuguese missionary Manoel da Assumpcam between 1734 and 1742. Nathaniel Brassey Halhed, a British grammarian, wrote a modern Bengali grammar 'A Grammar of the Bengal Language' (1778) that used Bengali types in print for the first time. Raja Ram Mohan Roy, the great Bengali Reformer, also wrote a \"Grammar of the Bengali Language\" (1832). During this period, the Choltibhasha form, using simplified inflections and other changes, was emerging from Shadhu Bhasha (older form) as the form of choice for written Bengali. Bengali was the focus, in 1951-52, of the Language Movement (Bhasha Andolon) in what was then East Pakistan (now Bangladesh). Although Bengali speakers were majorities in the population of Pakistan, Urdu was legislated as the sole national language. On February 21, 1952, protesting students and activists walked into military and police fire in DU and 3 young students and several others were killed. Subsequently, UNESCO has declared 21 February as International Mother Language Day.

It’s a film that’s relatable whether you’re going to high school now or did back when the movie takes place since Chbosky has found a way of capturing a lot of the feelings we all experience, despite the movie clearly being set in a time period that dictated a soundtrack which includes many classic tunes from the 70s through the 90s by the likes of the Smiths, the Cocteau Twins, David Bowie, XTC, Cracker and New Order. (You can read our review here. ComingSoon.net got on the phone with author, screenwriter and director Stephen Chbosky before the premiere of his movie at this year’s Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) and we spoke to him about the transition to filmmaker, working with young actors and putting together that soundtrack. ComingSoon.net: I haven’t read the book unfortunately, but I’ve heard it’s good and I hope to get to it soon. I’m sure people tell you that they see themselves in the characters, but there are scenes in the movie that mirrored my own high school experience. I was kind of freaked out by that.Stephen Chbosky: Well, yeah, I based it on your life. CS: Oh, you did?Chbosky: I didn’t clear that with you, I should have cleared that. I’m sorry. CS: No worries, no worries. I was curious about that because I kept a lot of journals back then and I haven’t seen them since. Anyway, the book came out back in 1999 so how long did it take for you to decide to adapt it into a screenplay and direct it yourself? Did you have others looking at doing it over the years?Chbosky: No, no, I never sold it, never optioned it, nothing. I knew I was going to do this myself. I just needed the time and distance really to do a real adaptation, you know what I mean? CS: It’s kind of ballsy because many other authors once they finish a book want to move on and not have anything to do with adapting it which is why I wondered if it took some time before you decided you had to adapt it yourself.Chbosky: I knew from the beginning. Making this movie was a lifelong dream of mine. I don’t really know why I was compelled to write my first novel twice except that the images in some of the scenes, they continued to be present in my life and I just felt that it was the right thing to do the movie. CS: Did you know from the beginning that you’d have to make major changes? I know that the novel is a series of letters but did you generally have to start from scratch for the screenplay?Chbosky: No, it wasn’t starting from scratch but to be honest, writing the screenplay was far more difficult than writing the book for me, because the book, when I wrote it, I was much younger and I was more connected to the insecurities and the feelings of being that age. What I had to start from scratch was mostly remembering what those first parties, first crushes, first kisses feel like. That took some work but once I had it, I felt very free inside of the work. CS: That must be one of the reasons why the book has connected with people and why the movie probably will, too. I graduated in 19XX and there was a lot of stuff from high school I had completely forgotten and seeing this movie reminded me about a lot of things. What year did you personally graduate and when was this set?Chbosky: I personally graduated from high school in 1988. The book is set in ’91 or ’92, and the movie, it’s basically early 90s is what I say. I said to all the design departments and to the music supervisor, “As long as it’s 1994 or earlier then I’m comfortable with it.” I didn’t want to do a standard period piece; I wanted it to feel more timeless than that, but it’s supposed to be early 90s. CS: The novel came out in 1999 so how long had you spent writing it before then?Chbosky: I started in college. That’s when I got the title and a couple of the images. I wrote it in the summer of 1996, that’s when Charlie’s voice really came to me and I wrote the first two letters. I had a third draft by the summer of ’98, and that’s what was published. CS: Going back to writing the screenplay, what were some of the things you felt you needed to change once you got the actors involved?Chbosky: Things didn’t change so much as they got clarified. Ted Tally who wrote the adaptation of “Silence of the Lambs,” a tremendous screenwriter, he had the best quote I ever heard about adapting where he said it’s basically turning soup back into bullion, and I love that analogy. You’re not changing it, you’re distilling it. You’re getting the story and the characters into their absolute central essence and it takes some back and forth, it takes overwriting and then taking out a few scenes then overwriting again, just to get the tone calibrated perfectly, but once you have it, it works. That’s what the process is. Nothing’s changed, it just got clarified. CS: Did it take a long time to get that first screenplay once you got going?Chbosky: No, it took a while like I said because of the emotional work to do it properly and to do it respectfully from a young person’s point of view, that took some time. Once I had that first monster draft, each subsequent draft got easier because it was about distilling and clarifying. CS: These characters must be close to you having written them twice, so when you started going after actors, which I imagine must have been about two or three years ago?Chbosky: Yeah, I went to Emma (Watson) two and a half years ago. CS: I assume the actors had read the book or knew the book and the characters but what did they bring to the characters when you got them on board that you didn’t expect?Chbosky: Because I knew the characters so well, it wasn’t as difficult to find the actors as you would think. Early on in the process, I made several comments. I said, “You have the book, and the book is exactly what you want it to be, so in the movie, embrace collaboration. Embrace your fellow artists. The actors will have ideas.” The producers, who have produced some terrific movies, listened to everybody. So once Emma came on board, she brought so much warmth and vulnerability and kindness and generosity to Sam and when she brought that, I knew that some parts of the script that were emphasizing parts of her character, those could quietly be lessened and other aspects could be heightened. Each person brings their own story, and what was so exciting about this was that Charlie was not just a character in my mind, Charlie was that plus a brilliant young actor in Logan Lerman who brought his own experiences, his own issues, his talent, his point of view, his humor–he’s so funny–and his vulnerability. Same with Ezra Miller, same with Mae Whitman. These kids–and even the adults like Paul Rudd, Melanie Lynskey–all of them! They brought so much to their characters and I just love actors, and there’s a reason why we paid money to see them. (chuckles) CS: I’ve spoken to Ezra a bunch of times and met him and I felt like Patrick was more like his real personality than in any other movie I’ve seen in him. He has so much comic energy.Chbosky: Oh 100%. I’ll never forget that my wife and I were watching “City Island” and my wife said, “God, that kid could be Patrick.” This was years ago, and at the time I said, “Oh, yeah, he’s great but he’s probably too young,” but then when we had auditions, Lianne Halfon (one of the producers) comes to me and says, “We found this kid. Oh my God! He had this audition, Ezra Miller.” And I looked at her and said, “Yeah, it’s the City Island’ kid. Wow, did he sprout, he is old enough!” Then we did a callback over Skype, believe it or not, and he was so good in that callback and we offered him the part that night. CS: Yeah, Ezra’s great and I know he doesn’t say “Yes” to a lot of things so it’s a real testament to the screenplay that he would do this.Chbosky: Yeah, he is very picky and he’s very genuine, but I think for all the kids, this was a special one for them and it meant a lot to me that they all came. CS: I want to talk about the music because that obviously plays a large part in the movie, because it sets the specific period of time. Were a lot of the songs in the movie mentioned in the book.Chbosky: Yeah, yeah, a lot of the songs were in the book. The Smiths’ “Asleep” was seminal, the Rocky Horror Picture Show stuff was as well. Past that, it really was again Alexandra Patsavas our music supervisor, and myself, the soundtrack is basically our mix tape back and forth. She brought in a lot of songs, I brought in a lot of songs, and then Jennifer Nash our music editor, she contributed, and it all came together. Yeah, I love that music and to their credit. How it works is that when you cut a movie, you put in every song that you ever wanted to put in, right? And then you test the movie and show it to an audience, and the audience loved it so much that Summit, to their credit, they gave us a lot more money. Normally, after the preview, you have to give all the good songs back and you have one week to find the cheap equivalent, but to their credit, they ponied up and we got the soundtrack we wanted to get. CS: I have to say that you don’t really heard The Smiths or even the Cocteau Twins used in movies much and I assumed they just say “no” to a lot of things. Did you have to show them the movie to convince them?Chbosky: No, a lot of people knew about the book and because this was a special project and because the book had good will out there, it wasn’t like they were asking for exorbitant amounts of money. It was just that there were so many songs, that’s what I mean. CS: I’ve heard so many stories about filmmakers having to give a big pitch to convince some artists to allow their songs to be used.Chbosky: People seemed to be very enthusiastic about being a part of the movie. I was nervous about the Smiths’ “Asleep” and I was nervous about the “Rocky Horror” (music) because it’s so important to the movie and the book, and the Smiths could have asked for the moon and we probably would have given it to them but they didn’t. When they realized how important it was, they gave us the song for well, I can’t say how much but they just got into the spirit of it and people seemed enthusiastic about being a part of this. CS: That’s great. I do have to call you on one thing though because at the dance that Sam and Charlie attend, she hears “Come On Eileen” by Dexy’s Midnight Runners and says, “They’re playing good music!” I went to high school when the song was popular and I don’t remember anyone liking it by the 90s.Chbosky: But the point is “They’re playing good music.” In other words, after listening to all this Top 40 and here’s one of the greatest dance songs. If you really think about it, if you play that at a wedding or anything, you’ll get people dancing at the most bogus events, that’s what she means. I love that song and it’s my favorite songs from the 80s. CS: Then no offense was intended. Now that this is finally coming out are you working on other things?Chbosky: Yeah, this process made me fall in love with writing books and directing movies and that’s what I want to do. I want to be an author/director and I’m writing my second book now and I want to make a movie of it, and I hope I get to do this for the rest of my life. I had the greatest time over the last two years. CS: As you’re writing the novel is it hard not to think of actors while writing them? How do you separate those two things?Chbosky: It’s hard to describe but I’ll just say that when you’re writing a novel, the world of the novel is so completely in of itself, actors don’t enter into the picture, you’re just creating a world, and then, just like “Perks,” once I have a screenplay, then I’ll know who I need to go out to. CS: But you’re still thinking of doing it as two separate things, writing the novel first and then once promotion is done, writing a screenplay?Chbosky: Yes. Yeah, that’s kind of how I like to do it because you can’t short change any part of the process. You can’t hurry the book along so the screenplay I have to do it the way that I do it, and I’m having a great time. CS: As a director, you got such great performances out of these young actors so do you have people coming to you wanting to direct other things? Is it hard to say no to things when you’re presented with other opportunities to direct?Chbosky: Thank you, that’s a very nice compliment, but it started. People are very excited about these performances and as I’ve said, I just love actors, and I love the art form and I’d love to help them be their best. It’s not difficult. If the right thing came along, I would absolutely direct something I did not write because I love the process so much, but we’ll see. I’m taking it day by day.

No, not in that saving-a-cat-from-a-burning-building way nor performing the Heimlich on a little old lady at a restaurant. He saved lives by writing a peculiar little green book called The Perks of Being A Wallflower. The semi-autobiographical story, told through a series of letters written to an unnamed pen pal and set in the early 1990s, follows an awkward high school freshman named Charlie navigating his way through the mess of high school—a pile of uncertainty marked with fake friends, issues with body image, struggles with sexuality and the pain of first love. Ever since the book's release in 1999, it's become a staple on every teenager's bookshelf thanks to its sensitive and accurate representation of teenage life. Ask any kid whose read it and they will tell you how much it has helped them make sense of their own life. Although because of the books treatment of drugs, suicide, sex, eating disorders and homosexuality, its also become one of the most frequently challenged books in history. But now, after being passed around from locker to locker in high school hallways for over a decade, the book is finally a movie, which is now out in theaters. Also written and directed by its author Chbosky, the film stars Logan Lerman, Emma Watson and Ezra Miller among a supporting cast that includes Paul Rudd, Mae Whitman, Nina Dobrev and Johnny Simmons. Complex got a chance to speak the man behind the phenomenon about what motivated him to write the book, how he feels about the idea of changing a kid's life and finding the perfect actors to play his beloved characters. Interview by Tara Aquino (@t_akino) Follow @ComplexPopCult Was it always your plan to turn it into a movie?It was always my plan. I thought of the title 21 years ago and I always envisioned this moment. I knew it was going to be a book and then I just had to make this movie because this is my lifelong dream. I read that your book was semi-autobiographical. What made you want to write it in the first place? When I was in my mid-20s I went through a bad break up and I was in a bad place in my life. I think I needed something to give myself some hope in that moment, and Charlie really came out of that need and out of the question of why good people let themselves get treated so badly. And at the end of writing the book, I was in a much better place. A lot of kids have connected with this book, how do you respond to people who say the book has changed their life?Here’s the wonderful thing, I talk to them individually because everyone comes up to me and says something like that; they say it for a different reasons and I wonder how it changed them, and we have a discussion. Every time people come up to me, they let me know that the book made them not feel alone, and all that does for me is make me not feel alone, because there was a time when there was me in a room thinking stuff, and wondering if anyone got it. And then to see how many people understand—now I feel far more connected to people than I ever did. Since you did write the screenplay and direct the movie, you must have gotten a bunch of offers from other people to adapt the book into their own movie.My agent said we would average a call a week, whether it was from producers optioning it or a writer or director wanting to adapt. Even a German film company, I don’t know the name of the company, but they wanted to buy it and turn it into a German film, which I would love to have seen, in an alternate universe kind of way. Yeah, there were many offers, but I couldn’t let it go. I don’t know how to sell something this personal. And especially what the book meant to the fans—I couldn’t let it go to anyone else. I owed the fans a movie that was worthy of their love for the book. When it came to the casting, what were you looking for and how did you settle on Ezra, Emma and Logan?Well, I mean, all I was looking for was the characters. I knew these characters so well because of the book and the screenplay and obviously the parts that were inspired by my life, but I was looking for terrific young actors but also really generous young people—that was very important. This movie doesn’t have bad guys and divas and attitudes, it doesn’t have that—it has people, like real people, and that’s important. So, with Emma, I saw her in the Goblet of Fire and she had that beautiful scene with Daniel Radcliffe in front of the staircase, and I love that scene and she broke my heart in it. And that was my first inkling that this is Sam. Then, we met in New York City and there was something about her. I just knew that this was a person who just wanted to break out and do something different and wanted to explore the wilder side of her self, and that is what Sam gave her. She never auditioned; I just knew she was right. Every time people come up to me, they let me know that the book made them not feel alone, and all that does for me is make me not feel alone, because there was a time when there was me in a room thinking stuff, and wondering if anyone got it. Logan and Ezra were slightly different. Logan in real life is a very confident young man and I thought he’d be good to play Patrick because he’s also very funny. I said, “Hey, why don’t you audition for Patrick?” And he said, “No, I want to audition for Charlie.” I was surprised by that, but I said, \"OK. I believe in following an actor's passion, so if that’s what you want, I'll be supportive. Let's do it.\" And he came in and he nailed it in five seconds because he had the balance of every characteristic that Charlie had, and everything that I wanted the character to be for the movie. With Ezra Miller, I did an audition over Skype, and even through Skype he was so charismatic and hilarious that we cast him within five hours of that audition. Yeah, Ezra Miller is just so magnetic on screen. It’s hard to not respond to him.It’s incredible, and this is the best thing about Ezra—really all the kids but were talking about Ezra—is that usually very free, improvisational-type actors are very difficult to give direction to. What’s so great about Ezra is it’s the best of both worlds—you can have your cake and you get to eat it, too. He'll do five takes and do something crazy every time, and then you can talk to him. Sometimes the thing that I wanted was the right thing, sometimes the invention he put out was the right thing. Phenomenal talent. And with Logan, especially playing Charlie, who is essentially kind of a part of you, did you see yourself in him? Is there anything that you connected with?We definitely had a bond, over the character and this thing that we just both understood. That happened, and it happened fairly quickly, but it evolved over time. It is actually funny you asked that. There's a photograph of me walking down the street with Logan, and you can just see our backs. What’s amazing is—I had no idea this was happening—we both have roughly the same posture, and we started to meld. I don’t know if he was getting things from me or if it was just a natural kind of camaraderie, but it definitely happened. Speaking of camaraderie, what was it like on the set? How did the young cast gel together?It was fantastic. The set was one of the best times I’ve ever had, and not just professionally, I mean I ever had in my life. Because even though its stressful and all those things,it was amazing watching these guys come together in the way that they did, and watching them become friends on screen and off-screen. Finally watching people like Emma, Logan, Ezra, and Mae who never had prom, never really had a proper graduation, because they were always working, and watching those kids get to have a high school experience that we all take for granted was very special. And I told them at the beginning that I wanted them to have the time of their lives, all of them, because it wasn’t even for them to just give me a good performance, I wanted them to be able to be kids because so often in their professional lives they weren’t allowed to be. What kind of things did you encourage them to do to have that experience?Well, the first thing was we made sure that everyone was in the same hotel. We were going to be in one place, that was number one. Number two: In certain moments, I planned activities to bring people closer together. When Logan, Ezra, Emma and I met for the first time, we all sat down in this little conference room, this little dinner theatre. It’s kind of a strange room. Anyway, we're at the hotel and we just sat down and chatted, and then within a half an hour I had to get going. So I left Ezra and Emma with our dance captain choreographer to construct the homecoming dance because I knew they both loved to dance and they both loved movement, and there's no better way to bond then in that way. Later that night, I took them all to dinner and I took them through the Fort Pitt Tunnel for the first time in their lives and that bonded them as friends, but also made them understand my vision for the movie and how beautiful I felt the movie was. Because if you have ever actually done the drive, it's astonishing, it's an astonishing thing to do. Have you ever stood up on the back of a pick-up truck? No, I have never done the back of the pick-up truck—no, no, no. I begged people to just not do it. We had safety cables, it was a beautiful image, but I wanted to do it. But, yeah I just hope no one does it. Anyway, so there were many other bonding things. All I’d say is once all the kids got in to that hotel, they basically took it over and turned it into a little common room/dorm room and they drove the management slightly crazy, but it was all in good fun. And they became friends—I don’t know, it meant a lot to me to watch them come together like that and be there for each other. Yeah, that definitely comes across on screen, and you feel like you went to high school with these people. By the end of the movie, you are part of their group of friends.You are, yes, and that’s exactly what I wanted it to feel like. Especially for a person who may be alone out there, who doesn’t feel like they have a whole lot of friends. I wanted to get that person back for him. Do you have any other plans to write another book?Yes, I’m two-thirds of the way through my next book right now, and it will either come out next year or the year after. Is it going to be another coming-of-age novel?Not exactly, but it will definitely be emotional. It will deal with some of the same themes. But it is more of a loving tribute to Stephen King, who is my favorite author. And it is about the friends that you make when you are a little kid. I love this one. Obviously Perks is always going to have a special place in my heart, but I love what I’m writing right now. Well, congratulations on the book and the film. The movie is getting great reviews and I think it's absolutely amazing.I really appreciate it because I knew there was a little risk in doing the movie. And I wanted to take it, because I thought it could do some good. And it gave me all these wonderful friends and it’s the most gratifying. I really appreciate your time and your obvious fondness for it, it means a lot to me.

No, not in that saving-a-cat-from-a-burning-building way nor performing the Heimlich on a little old lady at a restaurant. He saved lives by writing a peculiar little green book called The Perks of Being A Wallflower.The semi-autobiographical story, told through a series of letters written to an unnamed pen pal and set in the early 1990s, follows an awkward high school freshman named Charlie navigating his way through the mess of high school—a pile of uncertainty marked with fake friends, issues with body image, struggles with sexuality and the pain of first love.Ever since the book's release in 1999, it's become a staple on every teenager's bookshelf thanks to its sensitive and accurate representation of teenage life. Ask any kid whose read it and they will tell you how much it has helped them make sense of their own life. Although because of the books treatment of drugs, suicide, sex, eating disorders and homosexuality, its also become one of the most frequently challenged books in history. But now, after being passed around from locker to locker in high school hallways for over a decade, the book is finally a movie, which is now out in theaters. Also written and directed by its author Chbosky, the film stars Logan Lerman, Emma Watson and Ezra Miller among a supporting cast that includes Paul Rudd, Mae Whitman, Nina Dobrev and Johnny Simmons.Complex got a chance to speak the man behind the phenomenon about what motivated him to write the book, how he feels about the idea of changing a kid's life and finding the perfect actors to play his beloved characters.Interview by Tara Aquino (@t_akino)Follow @ComplexPopCultWas it always your plan to turn it into a movie?It was always my plan. I thought of the title 21 years ago and I always envisioned this moment. I knew it was going to be a book and then I just had to make this movie because this is my lifelong dream. I read that your book was semi-autobiographical. What made you want to write it in the first place? When I was in my mid-20s I went through a bad break up and I was in a bad place in my life.

School bells are beginning to ring across the country, but instead of boarding the Hogwarts Express this fall, actress Emma Watson will enroll at a Pennsylvania high school for \"The Perks of Being a Wallflower.\" The film, an adaptation of Stephen Chbosky's coming-of-age novel (published by MTV Books), tells the story of loner Charlie (played by Logan Lerman) and his life-changing experience befriending eccentric step-siblings Sam (Watson) and Patrick (Ezra Miller). MTV News visited the set recently to get a behind-the-scenes look at the drama ... and pick up a few dance moves from the film's stars as they boogied at the Sadie Hawkins dance. \"We've got this really catchy song, and we were just talking about it, like, every time we go, I still get pumped up because it's one of those energetic songs,\" Nina Dobrev (who plays Charlie's sister, Candace) enthused about the Dexys Midnight Runners hit \"Come On Eileen.\" \"Ezra and I are not trained dancers, but we both love dance,\" Watson said with a grin. \"I feel like I've been waiting for 'Perks.' I was waiting for this story, this script, this moment,\" she continued. \"I was a huge 'Harry Potter' fan even before I did the movies, and I thought I would never find a character or material I care about so deeply and personally as I did that, and then this came along and completely swept it all.\" \"Perks\" is just one of a number of increasingly mature roles Watson has signed on to of late, which also include \"The Bling Ring\" and \"Noah.\" But her co-stars say her \"Perks\" role will be the one that truly introduces audiences to the grown-up Emma. \"She's a brilliant actress, and this is a great debut for her outside the 'Harry Potter' series,\" Lerman said. \"This has been a really great choice for Emma, and the role couldn't be more perfect for her,\" echoed Dobrev. \"It's different than 'Harry Potter.' She's showing everyone in the world that she's got a different side of her and that she's not just this one character. She's kicking butt and taking names.\" For her part, Watson seems pleased and humbled to be in a film that will once again resonate with so many young adults. \"I don't think there will be one teenager who will watch this and not have one story or one moment that they don't deeply feel they can relate to,\" she said. \"The Perks of Being a Wallflower,\" also starring Mae Whitman, Paul Rudd, Dylan McDermott and Kate Walsh, opens in limited release September 21.

Amy Wilkinson 08/17/2012 School bells are beginning to ring across the country, but instead of boarding the Hogwarts Express this fall, actress Emma Watson will enroll at a Pennsylvania high school for \"The Perks of Being a Wallflower.\" The film, an adaptation of Stephen Chbosky's coming-of-age novel (published by MTV Books), tells the story of loner Charlie (played by Logan Lerman) and his life-changing experience befriending eccentric step-siblings Sam (Watson) and Patrick (Ezra Miller). MTV News visited the set recently to get a behind-the-scenes look at the drama ... and pick up a few dance moves from the film's stars as they boogied at the Sadie Hawkins dance. \"We've got this really catchy song, and we were just talking about it, like, every time we go, I still get pumped up because it's one of those energetic songs,\" Nina Dobrev (who plays Charlie's sister, Candace) enthused about the Dexys Midnight Runners hit \"Come On Eileen.\" \"Ezra and I are not trained dancers, but we both love dance,\" Watson said with a grin. \"I feel like I've been waiting for 'Perks.' I was waiting for this story, this script, this moment,\" she continued. \"I was a huge 'Harry Potter' fan even before I did the movies, and I thought I would never find a character or material I care about so deeply and personally as I did that, and then this came along and completely swept it all.\" \"Perks\" is just one of a number of increasingly mature roles Watson has signed on to of late, which also include \"The Bling Ring\" and \"Noah.\" But her co-stars say her \"Perks\" role will be the one that truly introduces audiences to the grown-up Emma. \"She's a brilliant actress, and this is a great debut for her outside the 'Harry Potter' series,\" Lerman said. \"This has been a really great choice for Emma, and the role couldn't be more perfect for her,\" echoed Dobrev. \"It's different than 'Harry Potter.' She's showing everyone in the world that she's got a different side of her and that she's not just this one character. She's kicking butt and taking names.\" For her part, Watson seems pleased and humbled to be in a film that will once again resonate with so many young adults. \"I don't think there will be one teenager who will watch this and not have one story or one moment that they don't deeply feel they can relate to,\" she said. \"The Perks of Being a Wallflower,\" also starring Mae Whitman, Paul Rudd, Dylan McDermott and Kate Walsh, opens in limited release September 21.

What can Brown's legions of fans expect from Inferno? A guide: First — why Inferno?\"Although I studied Dante's Inferno in high school, it wasn't until recently, while researching in Florence, that I came to appreciate the enduring influence of Dante's work on the modern world,\" said Brown in a statement. \"With this new novel, I am excited to take readers on a journey deep into this mysterious realm... a landscape of codes, symbols, and more than a few secret passageways.\" Is there any other information on Inferno's plot?Amazon's book description offers this info: \"In the heart of Italy, Harvard professor of symbology, Robert Langdon, is drawn into a harrowing world centered on one of history's most enduring and mysterious literary masterpieces... Dante's Inferno. Against this backdrop, Langdon battles a chilling adversary and grapples with an ingenious riddle that pulls him into a landscape of classic art, secret passageways, and futuristic science. Drawing from Dante's dark epic poem, Langdon races to find answers and decide whom to trust... before the world is irrevocably altered.\" What do critics think?They're less than pleased. \"If Dan Brown does for Dante what he did for Leonardo [Da Vinci], the general public will probably be delighted, while the scholarly community will probably tear out their hair,\" says Stephen Milner, the Serena professor of Italian at Manchester University, in an interview with The Independent. In the months after its release, The Da Vinci Code proved maddening for many religious scholars, who found it difficult to convince the novel's millions of fans that its dramatic \"revelations\" about Jesus Christ were truly fictional, and some fear that Brown's decision to tackle Dante's revered, Christianity-infused text could have a similar effect. Will there be a movie adaptation of Inferno?That probably depends on the success or failure of the upcoming film adaptation of 2009's The Lost Symbol, which was Dan Brown's previous Robert Langdon book. The Lost Symbol will reportedly enter pre-production in 2013, with Never Let Me Go's Mark Romanek as a possible director and Tom Hanks reprising the role of Robert Langdon for a third time. While Ron Howard's 2006 adaptation of The Da Vinci Code earned more than $750 million during its run at the box office, 2009 follow-up Angels & Demons earned just under $500 million — a solid gross, but a sign that the franchise may not have a long-term future at the box-office.

Officially, the People’s Republic of China is an atheist country. From a different perspective, however, it appears to be a country where religion and government are one. China’s leaders are not only political leaders; they are also spiritual leaders. In Christianity, the supreme authority is God. In Islam, the top authority is Allah. In the Chinese government, the highest authorities are Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping, and Jiang Zemin. The Christians have the Bible, the Muslims have the Koran, but in China, Chairman Mao’s Quotations, Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Selected Articles of Deng Xiaoping, and various publications of Jiang Zemin’s speeches have attained the status of China’s \"Bible.\" There is a difference, though: the Bible and the Koran are like Lunyu (Confucius’ teachings). No matter how many copies were published, Jesus, Mohammed and Confucius never made a penny from their books. Yet Mao, Deng and Jiang made a fortune from all of the publications that bear their names. And the Chinese government has paid for the bills. According to independent research, during the ten years of the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976), China published 870 editions of Selected Works of Mao Zedong (Volume 1-4). The total published was 325 million paperbacks and 2.55 million hard covers. China also published the same book in 14 foreign different languages, including English and French for a total volume of 1.22 million. Over 500 million copies of another book, Selected Articles of Mao Zedong, were printed, for a total volume of 252.5 million. In addition, China also published many single-article books from Mao Zedong. There are over 6,000 editions. The total volume reached the astronomical figure of 2.886 billion! The largest number of volumes so far is Chairman Mao’s Quotations. In the second half of 1966, in China, 200 to 300 printing factories printed this book. Most provinces printed enough books for the entire population, one per person. In October 1966, the Central Propaganda Ministry approved the export of Chairman Mao’s Quotations. By May of 1967, in only eight months, China International Book Trading Corporation exported over 800,000 copies to 117 countries and regions in 14 languages. Some researchers calculated that during the Cultural Revolution, the total volume of Chairman Mao’s Quotations published in China and abroad was over 5 billion. There are 500 editions in over 50 languages. The book was arguably the world’s \"most popular book in the 20th century.\" As for Deng Xiaoping’s books, according to the data in 1993, up until the end of 1992, China had published 56 of Deng’s works, totaling over 100 million copies. For Jiang Zemin, according to research, his book On the Three Representations \"sold\" more than 100 million copies. Each member of the 68 million Communist Party members has at least one copy. All the government employees, including teachers and doctors also have the book. There is no accurate number to indicate exactly how many books he had published during his 13 years in power. {mospagebreak} Such an astronomical number of copies represents a huge profit. According to reliable statistics, by the end of May 2001, Mao Zedong’s work had generated 131 million yuan (US$16 million). Deng Xiaoping’s publication Selected Articles of Deng Xiaoping (Volume 1,2,3) in 1993 had a price tag of 35.4 yuan (US$4.4). Assuming the remuneration was 15 percent and the volume was 50 million (each Party member has one), the one-time income was 265 million yuan (US$33 million). Also an independent researcher estimated that Jiang Zemin made a huge profit. His book On the Three Representations sells at 12 yuan per copy. With 80 million copies, at 15 percent of payment, his estimated profit is 144 million yuan (US$18 million). We should point out that it is primarily the government that buys Deng’s and Jiang’s books. Consider the following. Mao met with President Nixon, Deng met with Prime Minister Thatcher, and Jiang Zemin met with President Clinton. They are all country leaders. But has the U.S. government ever published any of Nixon’s quotations? Has the U.K. government ever published any of Mrs. Thatcher’s works? Has the U.S. government ever published any of Clinton’s articles? How much profit did Nixon, Thatcher, and Clinton make from government spending on their books? China’s social system is so-called Socialism, but with a Chinese flavor. It has a strong Chinese flavor indeed. Jiao Guobiao was an associate professor of journalism in Beijing University. His article \"Declaration of the Campaign against The Central Propaganda Department\" criticizes that the Central Propaganda Department is the largest and most powerful protective umbrella for the forces of evil and corruption in China. The article was well-liked by Chinese people but angered the authorities. He was later dismissed from his post by the university. © 2022 Global Communications Association, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

China’s leaders are not only political leaders; they are also spiritual leaders. In Christianity, the supreme authority is God. In Islam, the top authority is Allah. In the Chinese government, the highest authorities are Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping, and Jiang Zemin. The Christians have the Bible, the Muslims have the Koran, but in China, Chairman Mao’s Quotations, Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Selected Articles of Deng Xiaoping, and various publications of Jiang Zemin’s speeches have attained the status of China’s \"Bible.\" There is a difference, though: the Bible and the Koran are like Lunyu (Confucius’ teachings). No matter how many copies were published, Jesus, Mohammed and Confucius never made a penny from their books. Yet Mao, Deng and Jiang made a fortune from all of the publications that bear their names. And the Chinese government has paid for the bills. According to independent research, during the ten years of the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976), China published 870 editions of Selected Works of Mao Zedong (Volume 1-4). The total published was 325 million paperbacks and 2.55 million hard covers. China also published the same book in 14 foreign different languages, including English and French for a total volume of 1.22 million. Over 500 million copies of another book, Selected Articles of Mao Zedong, were printed, for a total volume of 252.5 million. In addition, China also published many single-article books from Mao Zedong. There are over 6,000 editions. The total volume reached the astronomical figure of 2.886 billion! The largest number of volumes so far is Chairman Mao’s Quotations. In the second half of 1966, in China, 200 to 300 printing factories printed this book. Most provinces printed enough books for the entire population, one per person. In October 1966, the Central Propaganda Ministry approved the export of Chairman Mao’s Quotations. By May of 1967, in only eight months, China International Book Trading Corporation exported over 800,000 copies to 117 countries and regions in 14 languages. Some researchers calculated that during the Cultural Revolution, the total volume of Chairman Mao’s Quotations published in China and abroad was over 5 billion. There are 500 editions in over 50 languages. The book was arguably the world’s \"most popular book in the 20th century.\" As for Deng Xiaoping’s books, according to the data in 1993, up until the end of 1992, China had published 56 of Deng’s works, totaling over 100 million copies. For Jiang Zemin, according to research, his book On the Three Representations \"sold\" more than 100 million copies. Each member of the 68 million Communist Party members has at least one copy. All the government employees, including teachers and doctors also have the book. There is no accurate number to indicate exactly how many books he had published during his 13 years in power. {mospagebreak} Such an astronomical number of copies represents a huge profit. According to reliable statistics, by the end of May 2001, Mao Zedong’s work had generated 131 million yuan (US$16 million). Deng Xiaoping’s publication Selected Articles of Deng Xiaoping (Volume 1,2,3) in 1993 had a price tag of 35.4 yuan (US$4.4). Assuming the remuneration was 15 percent and the volume was 50 million (each Party member has one), the one-time income was 265 million yuan (US$33 million). Also an independent researcher estimated that Jiang Zemin made a huge profit. His book On the Three Representations sells at 12 yuan per copy. With 80 million copies, at 15 percent of payment, his estimated profit is 144 million yuan (US$18 million). We should point out that it is primarily the government that buys Deng’s and Jiang’s books. Consider the following. Mao met with President Nixon, Deng met with Prime Minister Thatcher, and Jiang Zemin met with President Clinton. They are all country leaders. But has the U.S. government ever published any of Nixon’s quotations? Has the U.K. government ever published any of Mrs. Thatcher’s works? Has the U.S. government ever published any of Clinton’s articles? How much profit did Nixon, Thatcher, and Clinton make from government spending on their books? China’s social system is so-called Socialism, but with a Chinese flavor. It has a strong Chinese flavor indeed. Jiao Guobiao was an associate professor of journalism in Beijing University. His article \"Declaration of the Campaign against The Central Propaganda Department\" criticizes that the Central Propaganda Department is the largest and most powerful protective umbrella for the forces of evil and corruption in China. The article was well-liked by Chinese people but angered the authorities. He was later dismissed from his post by the university.

endlessly over which book is the \"best\" of all time, but finding out which ones have enjoyed the most commercial success should be a more concrete endeavor. We can just look at the sales numbers and rank them. Unfortunately, this turns out to be quite a challenge itself. There is no central repository for total sales numbers for books. Publishers may not share sales numbers for individual books, or their reported numbers may be inaccurate (they seem prone to creative exaggeration, particularly when a movie version of the book is coming out soon). It gets even worse when you consider that many books are put out in multiple editions over the years, often by entirely different publishers. Older works that are in the public domain might be published simultaneously by several different publishers. The fact is, any worldwide sales figures for a book more than a few years old are educated guesses at best. Advertisement These problems are compounded when you consider religious texts like the Bible, the Quran, and the Book of Mormon. Not only are sales numbers impossible to verify, but these types of books are often given out to followers or handed out in public places. Even if you could somehow pin down the number of copies actually sold, the books are required reading for adherents of some of the world's largest religions. Comparing their sales numbers to the works of Dickens or Rowling is like comparing apples to oranges. Therefore, these books, along with \"Quotations from Mao Zedong\" (which has the same issues with computing sales numbers as the others, although it is not a religious text) have been excluded from this list. For the record, the excluded books have sold an estimated hundreds of millions of copies each (several billion, in the Bible's case) and would have taken most of the top positions on the list. With all those caveats in mind (and not including e-book sales), here are the 21 best-selling books of all time, as far as we can tell. Miguel de Cervantes' novel about a man who becomes so infatuated with tales of knights that he decides to become one is one of the first novels ever written, originally published in 1612. Quixote's misadventures as he travels across the Spanish countryside seeking wrongs to right and downtrodden people to uplift have amused and enthralled generations of readers, and gave us the idiom \"tilting at windmills\" to indicate a noble but futile endeavor. While the novel enjoys surges in popularity now and then, especially in Spain, the sales number is a guess. It is the oldest book on this list, so it's had a long time to accrue sales. There is, of course, no way to tally sales from the 1600s, so although some sources suggest that this has sold 500 million copies, there's no way anyone could know for certain. We've placed it at this point on the list as a book that has had a great deal of worldwide popularity over a great span of time, but with an indeterminate total sales number. Advertisement This Chinese-language dictionary was first published in 1953. It became the standard dictionary among Chinese schoolchildren. Its widespread use in the most populous nation in the world (1.3 billion people as of 2010) gives this book a unique place on our list as the only reference book making an appearance. Advertisement First published in 1859, this novel by Charles Dickens examines the class struggles that lead to the French Revolution, and the uncomfortable truth that sometimes the revolutionaries are worse than the establishment. \"It was the best of times; it was the worst of times.\" Because this book is in the public domain and has been published in numerous editions by hundreds of publishers over the last 150 years, it's impossible to ascertain the exact number of copies sold. The number 200 million is controversial -- however, considering that the book is regularly on the required reading lists of students in the U.S. and elsewhere, it's entirely plausible. Advertisement Fantasy plays a big role on this list -- and note that there are no science-fiction novels. \"The Lord of the Rings\" by J.R.R. Tolkien is perhaps the ultimate fantasy novel, the work that established the modern fantasy genre. It may seem like a cheat to list it as a single novel, but that's how it was written. The original publisher divided it up for logistical purposes in 1954, but for most of its history it has been sold as a single work (often in lavish boxed sets). Advertisement The first volume in J.K. Rowling's blockbuster series about young wizards living in a magical modern world is a perfect example of the difficulties in finding exact numbers for a list of this nature. It was first published in 1997, fully subject to modern sales tracking methods. However, with different publishers for different nations, and various publishers reporting seemingly exaggerated numbers, it's more accurate to say, \"107 million, give or take 20 million or so.\" Advertisement This is the best-selling book by British mystery legend Agatha Christie, first printed in 1939. It details a series of murders on an island in which each death coincides with a line from an old nursery rhyme, with the seemingly impossible crime explained in Christie's ingenious epilogue. The sales number is an estimate: Christie was once called the world's best-selling author by the Guinness Book of World Records, with 1 billion books sold worldwide. Since \"And Then There Were None\" is her best-selling book, 100 million copies sold is a good ballpark figure. Advertisement This Chinese novel chronicles the rise and fall of a family during the Qing dynasty, and was first published in 1791 by author Cao Xueqin. It's considered one of the classic works of Chinese literature, and has an entire field of literary study devoted to it. It remains popular even today, as new theories and ideas about it rekindle interest. The sales number is, again, an estimate -- one that might actually be a bit low considering how many years the book has been in print with sustained popularity in a nation of 1.3 billion people. Advertisement \"The Little Prince,\" by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, is a strange yet charming children's book about a prince who lives on a tiny asteroid. Published in 1943, it became extremely popular in France and then won over readers around the world. There are monuments to it worldwide, and astronomers even named an actual asteroid for the one the prince lives on in the story. The sales number is uncertain. Some sources list it at a startling 200 million, while other list it at 80 million. Advertisement C.S. Lewis published this religious-themed fantasy novel in 1950. Intended as a children's book, it's set during World War II and is a classic example of a \"magical doorway\" story, in which a gate between the normal world and a magical one is discovered. This formula would, of course, be used to great success years later by J.K. Rowling. Lewis' young protagonists travel to a realm called Narnia, where they encounter all manner of anthropomorphized animals, fantastical people and a godly lion. This book leads to an entire series of Narnia novels. Like nearly every book on this list that isn't a dictionary, it was also made into a film. Advertisement Dan Brown's 2003 mystery novel about a conspiracy hiding the secrets of the Catholic Church was no doubt boosted in popularity when the Catholic Church decried it (and the inevitable film, starring Tom Hanks). It shows that mystery novels are capable of holding their own against the fantasy books on this list, particularly if they go beyond a simple murder mystery to explore historical secrets and shadowy cabals. Author Napoleon Hill is sometimes considered the father of the self-help movement in the U.S. He studied successful and wealthy people and then created a formula for achieving personal success. This, his most popular book, was released in 1937 during the Great Depression. It distilled his formula into a philosophical system for success that apparently resonated with people struggling to get by. It stayed on best-seller lists for many years, and spawned an entire industry of books about how to be a better person. This was the sixth book in the seven-book Harry Potter series (all seven make this list). It is notable for detailing the childhood of main villain Voldemort, and for an infamous death scene that shocked many fans. Not only has it sold lots of copies, it sold them incredibly quickly -- nine million within 24 hours of its release in 2005. \"The Alchemist\" is something of an oddity on this list, and may not belong here at all. Written in Portuguese by Paulo Coelho in 1986, and then translated into English in 1993, it is touted as an allegorical tale (basically a retelling of an old folk tale) about a young shepherd who seeks his destiny in the desert. Some sources indicate that it has sold 65 million copies. However, it's possible that number was inflated to drum up interest in anticipation of a potential film adaptation [source: AFP]. The second book in the Harry Potter series, released in 1998, uncovers more of the mysteries of the wizard school Hogwarts and series villain Voldemort. It's difficult to say why some books in the series sell more or less than others – though they're all within about 10 million of each other, which is well within the expected margin of error and uncertainty. J.D. Salinger's 1951 book about teen disillusionment is a must-read for adolescents everywhere – literally, in many cases. Like \"A Tale of Two Cities,\" sales numbers for Salinger's novel likely benefit from frequent inclusion on high school required reading lists. The fourth book in the series (2000) centers on the Tri-Wizard tournament, a friendly competition between representatives of the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and two rival schools, and features Harry's first face-to-face meeting with a newly corporeal Voldemort. This series alone causes this list to skew heavily toward fantasy; the genre accounts for one third of the list. Harry Potter book number five (2003) introduces a secret society dedicated to resisting Voldemort's growing power. Whether this book, \"Goblet of Fire,\" or \"Prisoner of Azkaban\" has sold more total copies is anyone's guess, and is immaterial in any case. All of the royalties went toward making J.K. Rowling one of the richest women in the world, with a net worth estimated at $1 billion. In this third installment, released in 1999, Harry and his friends have adventures involving werewolves and time travel at Hogwarts and learn a bit about Harry's parents, James and Lily, who died protecting him. Lew Wallace wrote this biblical tale, publishing it in 1880. It cleverly discusses the life and times of Jesus Christ indirectly, using the protagonist, Judah Ben-Hur, to observe Christ and other aspects of life in that era. Wallace meticulously researched the historical accuracy of the novel. It is credited with popularizing novels in the U.S., since the religious themes made it more palatable to readers at the time. The sales number is an estimate – it was enormously popular in the years after it was first published, but few people read the novel these days. It's more likely you've heard of it because of the 1959 film starring Charlton Heston. This controversial novel by Vladimir Nabokov was first published in 1955. It has often been banned due to the nature of its subject matter – it concerns a man, Humbert Humbert, who develops a sexual relationship with his 12-year-old stepdaughter. Despite its lurid premise, the novel does have its champions: Time named it one of the 100 best novels ever published since the magazine's 1923 debut [source: Grossman]. The final, mammoth volume in the Harry Potter series was released in 2007 and had sold 44 million copies just one year later -- and that's before the paperback version had even come out. It has certainly passed the 50 million mark at this point. There are several other books that are reported to have sold in the neighborhood of 50 million copies, including \"The Common Sense Book of Baby and Childcare\" by Dr. Benjamin Spock, and Alpine classic \"Heidi's Years of Wandering and Learning\" by Johanna Spyri.

We've placed it at this point on the list as a book that has had a great deal of worldwide popularity over a great span of time, but with an indeterminate total sales number.Advertisement2: Xinhua Zidian – 400 millionThis Chinese-language dictionary was first published in 1953. It became the standard dictionary among Chinese schoolchildren. Its widespread use in the most populous nation in the world (1.3 billion people as of 2010) gives this book a unique place on our list as the only reference book making an appearance.Advertisement3: A Tale of Two Cities – 200 million \"\" Charles Dickens, author of the classic novel \"A Tale of Two Cities.\" FPG/Getty ImagesFirst published in 1859, this novel by Charles Dickens examines the class struggles that lead to the French Revolution, and the uncomfortable truth that sometimes the revolutionaries are worse than the establishment. \"It was the best of times; it was the worst of times.\"Because this book is in the public domain and has been published in numerous editions by hundreds of publishers over the last 150 years, it's impossible to ascertain the exact number of copies sold. The number 200 million is controversial -- however, considering that the book is regularly on the required reading lists of students in the U.S. and elsewhere, it's entirely plausible.Advertisement4: The Lord of the Rings – 150 millionFantasy plays a big role on this list -- and note that there are no science-fiction novels. \"The Lord of the Rings\" by J.R.R. Tolkien is perhaps the ultimate fantasy novel, the work that established the modern fantasy genre. It may seem like a cheat to list it as a single novel, but that's how it was written. The original publisher divided it up for logistical purposes in 1954, but for most of its history it has been sold as a single work (often in lavish boxed sets).Advertisement5: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone – 107 million \"\" J.K. Rowling, author of \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,\" reads the book to eager children at the 2010 White House Easter Egg Roll in Washington, D.C. Chip Somodevilla/Getty ImagesThe first volume in J.K. Rowling's blockbuster series about young wizards living in a magical modern world is a perfect example of the difficulties in finding exact numbers for a list of this nature. It was first published in 1997, fully subject to modern sales tracking methods. However, with different publishers for different nations, and various publishers reporting seemingly exaggerated numbers, it's more accurate to say, \"107 million, give or take 20 million or so.\"Advertisement6: And Then There Were None – 100 millionThis is the best-selling book by British mystery legend Agatha Christie, first printed in 1939. It details a series of murders on an island in which each death coincides with a line from an old nursery rhyme, with the seemingly impossible crime explained in Christie's ingenious epilogue.The sales number is an estimate: Christie was once called the world's best-selling author by the Guinness Book of World Records, with 1 billion books sold worldwide. Since \"And Then There Were None\" is her best-selling book, 100 million copies sold is a good ballpark figure.Advertisement7: Dream of the Red Chamber – 100 million \"\" A performer auditions for a role in a Chinese television series based on the classic novel \"Dream of the Red Chamber.\" China Photos/Getty Images EntertainmentThis Chinese novel chronicles the rise and fall of a family during the Qing dynasty, and was first published in 1791 by author Cao Xueqin. It's considered one of the classic works of Chinese literature, and has an entire field of literary study devoted to it. It remains popular even today, as new theories and ideas about it rekindle interest. The sales number is, again, an estimate -- one that might actually be a bit low considering how many years the book has been in print with sustained popularity in a nation of 1.3 billion people.Advertisement8: The Little Prince – 80 million (or perhaps 200 million)\"The Little Prince,\" by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, is a strange yet charming children's book about a prince who lives on a tiny asteroid. Published in 1943, it became extremely popular in France and then won over readers around the world. There are monuments to it worldwide, and astronomers even named an actual asteroid for the one the prince lives on in the story.The sales number is uncertain. Some sources list it at a startling 200 million, while other list it at 80 million.Advertisement9: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe – 85 millionC.S. Lewis published this religious-themed fantasy novel in 1950. Intended as a children's book, it's set during World War II and is a classic example of a \"magical doorway\" story, in which a gate between the normal world and a magical one is discovered. This formula would, of course, be used to great success years later by J.K. Rowling.Lewis' young protagonists travel to a realm called Narnia, where they encounter all manner of anthropomorphized animals, fantastical people and a godly lion. This book leads to an entire series of Narnia novels. Like nearly every book on this list that isn't a dictionary, it was also made into a film.Advertisement10: The Da Vinci Code – 80 million \"\" The Spanish cover for Dan Brown's blockbuster novel \"The Da Vinci Code.\" Anel Fernandez/Getty ImagesDan Brown's 2003 mystery novel about a conspiracy hiding the secrets of the Catholic Church was no doubt boosted in popularity when the Catholic Church decried it (and the inevitable film, starring Tom Hanks). It shows that mystery novels are capable of holding their own against the fantasy books on this list, particularly if they go beyond a simple murder mystery to explore historical secrets and shadowy cabals.11: Think and Grow Rich – 70 millionAuthor Napoleon Hill is sometimes considered the father of the self-help movement in the U.S. He studied successful and wealthy people and then created a formula for achieving personal success. This, his most popular book, was released in 1937 during the Great Depression. It distilled his formula into a philosophical system for success that apparently resonated with people struggling to get by. It stayed on best-seller lists for many years, and spawned an entire industry of books about how to be a better person.12: Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince – 65 million \"\" Copies of \"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\" sit in an Amazon.com warehouse in Nevada. Justin Sullivan/Getty ImagesThis was the sixth book in the seven-book Harry Potter series (all seven make this list). It is notable for detailing the childhood of main villain Voldemort, and for an infamous death scene that shocked many fans. Not only has it sold lots of copies, it sold them incredibly quickly -- nine million within 24 hours of its release in 2005.13: The Alchemist – 65 million\"The Alchemist\" is something of an oddity on this list, and may not belong here at all. Written in Portuguese by Paulo Coelho in 1986, and then translated into English in 1993, it is touted as an allegorical tale (basically a retelling of an old folk tale) about a young shepherd who seeks his destiny in the desert.Some sources indicate that it has sold 65 million copies. However, it's possible that number was inflated to drum up interest in anticipation of a potential film adaptation [source: AFP].14: Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets – 60 million \"\" A young fan brandishes her copy of \"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\" at the Borders at Time Warner Center in New York City. Astrid Stawiarz/Getty ImagesThe second book in the Harry Potter series, released in 1998, uncovers more of the mysteries of the wizard school Hogwarts and series villain Voldemort. It's difficult to say why some books in the series sell more or less than others – though they're all within about 10 million of each other, which is well within the expected margin of error and uncertainty.15: The Catcher in the Rye – 60 millionJ.D. Salinger's 1951 book about teen disillusionment is a must-read for adolescents everywhere – literally, in many cases. Like \"A Tale of Two Cities,\" sales numbers for Salinger's novel likely benefit from frequent inclusion on high school required reading lists.16: Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire – 55 million \"\" A Barnes and Noble employee in Atlanta holds copies of \"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.\" Erik S. Lesser/Getty ImagesThe fourth book in the series (2000) centers on the Tri-Wizard tournament, a friendly competition between representatives of the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and two rival schools, and features Harry's first face-to-face meeting with a newly corporeal Voldemort. This series alone causes this list to skew heavily toward fantasy; the genre accounts for one third of the list.17: Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix – 55 millionHarry Potter book number five (2003) introduces a secret society dedicated to resisting Voldemort's growing power. Whether this book, \"Goblet of Fire,\" or \"Prisoner of Azkaban\" has sold more total copies is anyone's guess, and is immaterial in any case. All of the royalties went toward making J.K. Rowling one of the richest women in the world, with a net worth estimated at $1 billion.18: Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban – 55 million \"\" Author J.K. Rowling arrives for the U.K. premiere of the film version of her novel \"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.\" Alan Davidson/Getty ImagesIn this third installment, released in 1999, Harry and his friends have adventures involving werewolves and time travel at Hogwarts and learn a bit about Harry's parents, James and Lily, who died protecting him.19: Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ – 50 millionLew Wallace wrote this biblical tale, publishing it in 1880. It cleverly discusses the life and times of Jesus Christ indirectly, using the protagonist, Judah Ben-Hur, to observe Christ and other aspects of life in that era. Wallace meticulously researched the historical accuracy of the novel. It is credited with popularizing novels in the U.S., since the religious themes made it more palatable to readers at the time.The sales number is an estimate – it was enormously popular in the years after it was first published, but few people read the novel these days. It's more likely you've heard of it because of the 1959 film starring Charlton Heston.20: Lolita – 50 million \"\" A group of London bookstore customers eagerly read \"Lolita\" as they wait to check out. Keystone/Getty ImagesThis controversial novel by Vladimir Nabokov was first published in 1955. It has often been banned due to the nature of its subject matter – it concerns a man, Humbert Humbert, who develops a sexual relationship with his 12-year-old stepdaughter. Despite its lurid premise, the novel does have its champions: Time named it one of the 100 best novels ever published since the magazine's 1923 debut [source: Grossman].21: Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – 50 millionThe final, mammoth volume in the Harry Potter series was released in 2007 and had sold 44 million copies just one year later -- and that's before the paperback version had even come out. It has certainly passed the 50 million mark at this point.There are several other books that are reported to have sold in the neighborhood of 50 million copies, including \"The Common Sense Book of Baby and Childcare\" by Dr. Benjamin Spock, and Alpine classic \"Heidi's Years of Wandering and Learning\" by Johanna Spyri.Lots More InformationRelated ArticlesHow Comic Books WorkHow Harry Potter's Wand WorksHow Narnia WorksHow Self-Publishing WorksHow does banning a book work?SourcesAFP. \"Film to be made of Coelho's 'The Alchemist'.\" May 19, 2008.

Chowringhee has that essential quality of a good novel: the capacity to escape, and help the reader escape, time. You want to turn the pages, but you do not want the pages to end. The words are fresh, and the world of the novel is completely alive, despite being written over 40 years ago. First published in Bengali in 1962, the novel became a bestseller and was translated into a number of Indian languages and made into a film and a play. But it has taken until now for it to be published in English outside India. Below the radar when Salman Rushdie surveyed the scene for his 1997 anthology, The Vintage Book of Indian Writing, it did not surface even for Amit Chaudhuri's later Picador Book of Modern Indian Literature, which begins with a large section on Bengali writing. Perhaps Sankar was too popular to be noted, even though two of his other books, Seemabaddha (Company Limited) and Jana Aranya (The Middleman) had the accolade of being filmed by the legendary Satyajit Ray. In a recent interview Sankar explains how he discovered Chowringhee, Calcutta's glittering esplanade and the world of his novel. From being a street hawker and a typewriter cleaner, by luck he became a clerk to India's last British lawyer, Noel Barwell. \"I was 17 and in constant awe of Noel. But he treated me like a friend and exposed me to the 'high life' of the rich and famous. I used to stay at [the hotel] Shahjahan's servants' quarters as his employee. I had a greenroom view of cabaret dancers, the private lives of celebrities ... \" After Barwell died, Mani Sankar Mukherji became Sankar the writer. The book is a banquet of stories served by a wide-eyed narrator, rather confusingly named Shankar and shaped by the hotel he comes to work in, the same Shahjahan. Although one of the characters tells us, \"At least a dozen novels about hotels are written in this country every year,\" I am not aware of another. There ought to be hundreds of them. The Shahjahan has cousins scattered around the world: the Galle Face Hotel in Colombo, Raffles in Singapore, the Peace Hotel in Shanghai, Reid's Palace in Madeira - hotels that nurture history and the memories of their guests and slowly develop a character of their own. You would expect them to loom large in modern fiction, given the number of writers who have stayed in them, but Shahjahan does seem to be surprisingly alone. \"It wasn't so much a hotel as a framed picture. In the alluring curves was not the arrogance of modern skyscrapers but the stamp of ancient aristocracy. Like a beautiful bride's bracelet, the neon light glinted in the darkness. It had three bands - green at the extremities and red in the middle; the flirtatious winking was limited to the green, while the red was like the unblinking eye ... \" Shankar is also refreshingly different. He begins as a babu who \"revelled in the role ... the lawyer's clerk\". He's happy to salute Curzon, \"the English Lord, much maligned by history\", on the first page and, at the end of the novel, quote Kipling in another ancient Calcutta hotel, railing against the sham of life. In between he quotes lines from other poets who are not identified but were perhaps obvious, as were the real-life models for some of the characters, to Calcutta readers in the 1960s. But other than a tendency to hyperbole in the early pages, Shankar does not inflict babu speech on the reader. Although many of the conversations take place in English there are none of the distractions of clever linguistics and forced humour with which babu characters so often burst the bubble of fiction and hurl us out of a story. Perhaps this is an unexpected consequence of the book having been written in Bengali. The early history of modern Bengali literary writing is said to have been a negotiation between a formal high style and the liveliness of everyday speech. Buddhadeb Bose, writing in 1948 on the impact of Tagore and Pramatha Chaudhuri, identifies the \"War of Words\", a \"battle that raged over the new style of prose\". Everyday spoken Bengali, which both these writers promoted, was regarded as too lightweight by the establishment of the time. But by the mid-century, Bose writes, \"The quality and quantity of our recent spoken-tongue prose indicate that though Pramatha Chaudhuri broke the ice, Rabindranath set the stream flowing.\" Chowringhee is perhaps a part of that flow. The writing is natural and uncluttered. The translation is transparent and one questions it only rarely over the odd phrase or image. Shankar is despondent on the death of his English employer. Then he stumbles into a job behind the reception desk of the Shahjahan, thanks to the help of a magnanimous but failing detective, Byron, whose client is the hotel manager Marco Polo (first seen in a \"sleeveless vest and tiny red briefs\"). Immediately we get an inkling that we are stepping into a Calcutta that offers rather more than the standard dal and masala fare. As it turns out, dal barely gets a mention in 400 pages, and that's after tutti frutti ice-cream - a delight in itself. Shankar's first task is to type out 50 breakfast menu cards. Jimmy, the steward, \"a veritable Mount Vesuvius\", barks out the list: \"Strange words, some of which I had never heard before, assailed my ears: chilled pineapple juice, rice crisps, eggs - boiled, fried, poached, scrambled. The man stopped for a while, gulped, and then continued yelling in the manner of reciting a multiplication table: omelette - prawns, cheese, tomato ... and so on. Words came tumbling out of his mouth like gunfire as he came to a halt with 'coffee'.\" Jimmy, like Marco Polo, is European, but in the cosmopolitan world of 1950s Calcutta, this is an unimportant detail that we discover late in the book, when the new Indian owners of the Shahjahan decide to keep the management foreign but modernise the hotel. In the end, the old Goan musician Gomez, with his love of Beethoven and Mozart, has to make way for a \"more cheerful\" band, and Shankar's contract is terminated because \"they're going to have only girls at the counter\". But between those first breakfast menu cards and the farewell banquet we waltz into a world of Moscow mules and Manhattans, honeymoon soup and sharkskin suits. We meet Connie, a stripper from Scotland via Persia, whose dance ends with her clothed only in bursting balloons; Karabi, a hostess who services suite number 2, permanently booked for corporate hospitality; Sutherland, the WHO expert with a secret past; as well as tycoons, politicians and conscience-stricken bartenders. Karabi's dilemma of having to choose between old and new values is one that most of the characters face at some point in their time at Shahjahan, including Marco Polo and Bose-da, his right-hand man, the fount of Shahjahan lore and fixer of high-society liaisons. Shankar learns to become the trusted servant of them all. The servant's tale, from Canterbury to Calcutta, Bangalore to Bath, often veers between anger and loss. Shankar's story in the end is one of loss: \"When I had checked in here, it was filled with known and familiar faces. Some left after breakfast; a few disappeared after lunch; others went away after tea. Now it was time for dinner, and no one was left ... I, the patriarch, seemed to have sat down at an empty table.\" Not quite true for his creator. Sankar, the writer, at the end, has Chowringhee: a lovely, charming book brimming with life and full of the unexpectedness of a closely observed world. Everything comes to the old hotel, either to the sumptuous guest rooms or to the terrace where the staff live. Love and death are never far away. Sankar writes of both simply and movingly. There will be many grateful readers at his table. Romesh Gunesekera's most recent novel is The Match (Bloomsbury) Book of the weekFictionHotel CalcuttaA classic Bengali novel, published in Britain for the first time, delights Romesh GunesekeraRomesh GunesekeraFri 17 Apr 2009 19.01 EDTGiven the frenetic energy and ebullience of recent fiction coming out of India, it is something of a relief to rediscover the pleasures of an absorbing story simply told. Chowringhee has that essential quality of a good novel: the capacity to escape, and help the reader escape, time. You want to turn the pages, but you do not want the pages to end. The words are fresh, and the world of the novel is completely alive, despite being written over 40 years ago. First published in Bengali in 1962, the novel became a bestseller and was translated into a number of Indian languages and made into a film and a play. But it has taken until now for it to be published in English outside India. Below the radar when Salman Rushdie surveyed the scene for his 1997 anthology, The Vintage Book of Indian Writing, it did not surface even for Amit Chaudhuri's later Picador Book of Modern Indian Literature, which begins with a large section on Bengali writing. Perhaps Sankar was too popular to be noted, even though two of his other books, Seemabaddha (Company Limited) and Jana Aranya (The Middleman) had the accolade of being filmed by the legendary Satyajit Ray. In a recent interview Sankar explains how he discovered Chowringhee, Calcutta's glittering esplanade and the world of his novel. From being a street hawker and a typewriter cleaner, by luck he became a clerk to India's last British lawyer, Noel Barwell. \"I was 17 and in constant awe of Noel. But he treated me like a friend and exposed me to the 'high life' of the rich and famous. I used to stay at [the hotel] Shahjahan's servants' quarters as his employee. I had a greenroom view of cabaret dancers, the private lives of celebrities ... \" After Barwell died, Mani Sankar Mukherji became Sankar the writer. The book is a banquet of stories served by a wide-eyed narrator, rather confusingly named Shankar and shaped by the hotel he comes to work in, the same Shahjahan. Although one of the characters tells us, \"At least a dozen novels about hotels are written in this country every year,\" I am not aware of another. There ought to be hundreds of them. The Shahjahan has cousins scattered around the world: the Galle Face Hotel in Colombo, Raffles in Singapore, the Peace Hotel in Shanghai, Reid's Palace in Madeira - hotels that nurture history and the memories of their guests and slowly develop a character of their own. You would expect them to loom large in modern fiction, given the number of writers who have stayed in them, but Shahjahan does seem to be surprisingly alone. \"It wasn't so much a hotel as a framed picture. In the alluring curves was not the arrogance of modern skyscrapers but the stamp of ancient aristocracy. Like a beautiful bride's bracelet, the neon light glinted in the darkness. It had three bands - green at the extremities and red in the middle; the flirtatious winking was limited to the green, while the red was like the unblinking eye ... \"Shankar is also refreshingly different. He begins as a babu who \"revelled in the role ... the lawyer's clerk\". He's happy to salute Curzon, \"the English Lord, much maligned by history\", on the first page and, at the end of the novel, quote Kipling in another ancient Calcutta hotel, railing against the sham of life. In between he quotes lines from other poets who are not identified but were perhaps obvious, as were the real-life models for some of the characters, to Calcutta readers in the 1960s. But other than a tendency to hyperbole in the early pages, Shankar does not inflict babu speech on the reader. Although many of the conversations take place in English there are none of the distractions of clever linguistics and forced humour with which babu characters so often burst the bubble of fiction and hurl us out of a story.Perhaps this is an unexpected consequence of the book having been written in Bengali. The early history of modern Bengali literary writing is said to have been a negotiation between a formal high style and the liveliness of everyday speech. Buddhadeb Bose, writing in 1948 on the impact of Tagore and Pramatha Chaudhuri, identifies the \"War of Words\", a \"battle that raged over the new style of prose\". Everyday spoken Bengali, which both these writers promoted, was regarded as too lightweight by the establishment of the time. But by the mid-century, Bose writes, \"The quality and quantity of our recent spoken-tongue prose indicate that though Pramatha Chaudhuri broke the ice, Rabindranath set the stream flowing.\" Chowringhee is perhaps a part of that flow. The writing is natural and uncluttered. The translation is transparent and one questions it only rarely over the odd phrase or image.Shankar is despondent on the death of his English employer. Then he stumbles into a job behind the reception desk of the Shahjahan, thanks to the help of a magnanimous but failing detective, Byron, whose client is the hotel manager Marco Polo (first seen in a \"sleeveless vest and tiny red briefs\"). Immediately we get an inkling that we are stepping into a Calcutta that offers rather more than the standard dal and masala fare. As it turns out, dal barely gets a mention in 400 pages, and that's after tutti frutti ice-cream - a delight in itself. Shankar's first task is to type out 50 breakfast menu cards. Jimmy, the steward, \"a veritable Mount Vesuvius\", barks out the list: \"Strange words, some of which I had never heard before, assailed my ears: chilled pineapple juice, rice crisps, eggs - boiled, fried, poached, scrambled. The man stopped for a while, gulped, and then continued yelling in the manner of reciting a multiplication table: omelette - prawns, cheese, tomato ... and so on. Words came tumbling out of his mouth like gunfire as he came to a halt with 'coffee'.\"Jimmy, like Marco Polo, is European, but in the cosmopolitan world of 1950s Calcutta, this is an unimportant detail that we discover late in the book, when the new Indian owners of the Shahjahan decide to keep the management foreign but modernise the hotel. In the end, the old Goan musician Gomez, with his love of Beethoven and Mozart, has to make way for a \"more cheerful\" band, and Shankar's contract is terminated because \"they're going to have only girls at the counter\". But between those first breakfast menu cards and the farewell banquet we waltz into a world of Moscow mules and Manhattans, honeymoon soup and sharkskin suits. We meet Connie, a stripper from Scotland via Persia, whose dance ends with her clothed only in bursting balloons; Karabi, a hostess who services suite number 2, permanently booked for corporate hospitality; Sutherland, the WHO expert with a secret past; as well as tycoons, politicians and conscience-stricken bartenders.Karabi's dilemma of having to choose between old and new values is one that most of the characters face at some point in their time at Shahjahan, including Marco Polo and Bose-da, his right-hand man, the fount of Shahjahan lore and fixer of high-society liaisons.

The anecdotes, rich and funny that chronicle lives and suffering in the urban jungle, just roll off his tongue as if he is a walking-talking storybook. At the launch of the English translation of his iconic debut novel, “Chowringhee”, 46 years after it was published in Kolkata in 1962, Shankar Wednesday kept a select audience on their edge of seats at the India Habitat Centre with the “stories inside the story” of “Chowringhee”, which was made into a hit movie in 1968 by Satyajit Ray. And also a play. The novel, translated into English by Kolkata-based former journalist Arunava Sinha, won the Vodafone Crossword Award 2007 for the best translation. The book set in the Kolkata of 1950s is a saga of the intimate lives of managers, employees and guests in one of its largest hotels, called Shahjahan in the novel. Shankar, the newest and the youngest recruit, recounts the stories of several people whose lives come together in the suites, backrooms and restaurants of the hotels. The book, priced at Rs.295, predates Arthur Hailey’s “Hotel” by three years and has been translated into Malayalam, Marathi, Hindi, Russian and now English. Its larger than life characters – the enigmatic hotel manager Marco Polo, debonair receptionist Sata Bose, the tragic hostess Karabi Guha – attained almost cult status. And the novel became a classic. “For the first time, I have been told that my book is finding a new segment of readers because it has been translated into English,” he said. “I am sure this has triggered curiosity about the book and how it was made,” the septuagenarian writer said, travelling down the memory lane. “I will reveal some inside stories about ‘Chowringhee’ that I could not tell for fear of a British barrister. I began my career as a clerk after my father passed away when I was barely in my teens. I had to drop out of studies in search of a job. The book was loosely based on him – more as a tribute because he introduced me to the world of good writing. Now that he is no more, I can share the inside stories,” the writer said with his trademark wit. According to Shankar, the idea for the book took off when he was still in the service of Noel Barwell, the last British barrister in the Kolkata High Court. “Barwell stayed for a long time at the Spencer’s Hotel in Kolkata and I was a frequent visitor to the hotel. It was through common friends at Spencer’s that I came to know what was happening at the Great Eastern Hotel, one of the biggest hotels in the metropolis then. “So, there was this notion that the book was inspired by Great Eastern Hotel. Actually, the muse was the Spencer’s Hotel. It was from there that my love affair with hotels began,” Shankar disclosed. The author, who was unusually expansive, also gave away the real identity of the charismatic receptionist of the Shahjahan hotel in the novel. “I got the idea to create the debonair Sata Bose, the receptionist, from a railway employee I chanced across. His name was Satya Sadhan Bose and since he had many sahib friends, he refused to be identified by anything but Sata Bose,” he divulged. A translation of another Shankar book, “Jana Aranya”, will soon be published by Penguin India, the publisher of “Chowinghee”. Shankar, whose stormed into Bengali homes with the marketing slogan “A bagful of Shankar (Ek Bag Shankar)”, is a household name in West Bengal.

Feeling that the role she was set to read, that of the 8-year-old middle child, Lisa Simpson, was mundane, with ''not much teeth,'' Cartwright tried the part of the 10-year-old Bart. Groening, creator of ''The Simpsons,'' said ''That's it! That's Bart!'' Thus Cartwright, now a 40-ish mother of two children, began a 13-year-stint on the series. In ''My Life as a 10-Year-Old Boy,'' Cartwright cheerfully chronicles her Ohio childhood, where she grew up as one of six children, with a voice that sounded male, proud to be the only girl trumpet player in school. At Ohio University she worked as a D.J., and finished her degree studying theater at the University of California, Los Angeles. Daws Butler, the voice of Yogi Bear and Quick-Draw McGraw, became her mentor and helped her make a demo tape for Hanna-Barbera. She acted in theater, situation comedies and movies before landing the job on ''The Simpsons.'' She details the behind-the-scenes animation process in which 400 artists in Los Angeles and Korea create 20,000 hand-painted drawings to make one 23-minute episode. She gushes over the show's 238 guest stars, who have included Elizabeth Taylor, Mel Gibson, Danny DeVito and Hugh Hefner, and recalls her thrill when Meryl Streep asked for her autograph (for her children). Although the paradoxes of being ''a celebrity nobody knows'' are interesting, the photographs, diary entries and overly cute commentaries make this book feel like a personal scrapbook, the voice unfortunately more Lisa than Bart.

Her one-woman show -- \"My Life As A 10-Year-Old Boy\" -- plays Friday at the Town Hall Theater, which recently reopened following a $5 million renovation. \"The performance itself, I don't really consider it a performance, it's so fun to do,\" she said. \"I'll follow a script, then I open it up to questions and answers at the end.

Bart Simpson's alter ego is coming to town, reports Charles Purcell. MY LIFE AS A 10-YEAR-OLD BOY Riverside Theatres, corner of Church and Market streets, ParramattaTonight at 7.30 and Sunday, 2pm $29.50-$39.50Bookings 8839 3399 It's not every day you speak on the phone with the legendary Bart Simpson. At least, that's what I told the operator I wanted to do, and she didn't seem fazed by the request. Sure enough, after a pause, the world's cheekiest 10-year-old comes on the line. \"I'm Bart Simpson. Who the hell are you?\" It's a freakish experience to hear the voice of the boy who has terrorised Springfield since the show's debut in 1989. It conjures many favourite Simpsons moments: Bart tormenting Principal Skinner, making Rod and Todd Flanders fight over a packet of sugar, phoning Moe and asking to speak to \"Seymour Butz\". A moment later, Bart's alter ego, Nancy Cartwright, comes on the line. \"I love saying that,\" she says. \"My other favourite line is\" - Nancy summons Bart again - \"He's such a bitch.\" She adds some trademark Bart chuckling, sending the hair on the back of my neck on end. Cartwright is coming to Parramatta's Big Laugh Comedy Festival to star in My Life As a 10-Year-Old Boy, in which she will spill the inside goss on working on The Simpsons and talk about her life as an actor and voice-actor. \"I'll take you to the back scenes of The Simpsons and my life and how I was destined to play Bart,\" she says. \"I'll show favourite clips of my characters and a 15-minute clip of my life. Believe me, I have a lot of fun doing the voice of Bart Simpson in public. \"Bart represents the side of us which wants to get away with things. Pundits might think he's not a good role model, but I say [she blows raspberry].\" Homer's son might have competition from Cartwright's other characters. \"Bart is the easiest one to do, but, live, people love Ralph Wiggum,\" she says. \"He's such a non sequitur.\" Bart and Ralph aren't the only voices she does on The Simpsons. Cartwright also does Nelson \"Ha ha\" Muntz, Kearney, Data Base ... Data Base? Apparently, he's a nerdy guy from Bart's school. \"Daaar, the meteor's coming towards us,\" says Cartwright, slipping into character and triggering a welcome flicker of recollection.

Cartwright originally planned to audition for the role of Lisa, but when she saw that Bart was also on the table, some cosmic wheel of fate turned, and she said a metaphorical \"eat my shorts\" to the other role. \"I wanted to be him,\" she says. \"And Matt Groening heard me do the role and said, 'Wow, you're Bart!'\" Cartwright's Simpsons connection also spills over into her family life. \"It's funny, my son is like Bart and my daughter is the epitome of Lisa,\" she says. \"They've never asked me to do Bart, but when my son was two, he had a Bart Simpson doll that had a string you could pull and hear Bart's voice. \"My son said to me, 'I don't see you in there.'

Simpsons devotees will have a chance to meet people involved with the program and purchase Simpsons-related art. Bart and Homer Simpson with the family dog, Santa's Little Helper (CP photo) The most high-prolife guest at Simpsons Mania will be Nancy Cartwright, the 44-year-old who provides the voice for 10-year-old Bart Simpson. As part of Simpsons Mania, Cartwright will stage the North American debut of My Life as a Ten-Year-Old Boy, her one-woman show about how she came to be Bart's alter ego. \"I take you on a romp through Springfield through my eyes. I tell stories, I tell anecdotes. Hopefully, I make you laugh, I make you cry. I talk about working with celebrities. I tell you what it's like being an anonymous celebrity,\" Cartwright recently told the Toronto Star by way of describing the show. As dedicated fans of the program know, Cartwright originally intended to audition for the voice of Lisa, Bart's sister, but changed her mind when she saw the description for Bart. \"I happened to score big-time. I was at the right place at the right time and I was ready. The stars must have been lined up because I was totally ready for it to happen,\" she added. Bart, Homer and the rest of the Simpson family first appeared in short segments on The Tracey Ullman Show in 1987, then graduated to their own series two years later. The show has since become a pop-culture touchstone, contributing such memorable episodes as Deep Space Homer and Flaming Moe's. It is now seen in over 60 countries. In the 2002 episode The Bart Wants What it Wants, the Simpsons travel to Toronto so Bart can be close to Greta Wolfcastle, the daughter of Springfield's resident movie star, Rainier Wolfcastle. David Silverman, an animator and director on The Simpsons, will also appear at Simpsons Mania, along with Chris Turner, author of Planet Simpson. Simpsons Mania takes place at the Metro Toronto Convention Centre on October 16. » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » »", "", "", " Home > Arts & Entertainment > Theatre & Dance > Reviews Inside the voice of Bart is a woman who fails to amuse By Julian Hall Tuesday, 10 August 2004 Apart from George Bush Snr, who famously lamented, \"We need a nation closer to the Waltons than the Simpsons,\" it seems that the whole world is a Bart fan.

Apart from George Bush Snr, who famously lamented, \"We need a nation closer to the Waltons than the Simpsons,\" it seems that the whole world is a Bart fan. There is thus a guaranteed audience for the voice of Bart, Nancy Cartwright, appearing in what, on the surface, is by far the most attractive of the \"Me shows\" that proliferate at this year's Fringe festival. The opening of this show is a welcome reminder of the genius of America's most celebrated dysfunctional family. What follows is a quick journey through Cartwright's life and career as well as a sketching of The Simpsons' progress since it began on The Tracey Ullman Show in 1987 when Bart looked like he would be even more at home hanging with Beavis and Butthead and Homer sounded like James Stewart. Cartwright never allows you to become bored but that means some issues are skirted over faster than American closing credits on television. You never really get a feel what it is like recording the show. Yes, it's nice to know that Dan Castellaneta (the voice of Homer), Harry Shearer (the voice of Montgomery Burns and Principal Skinner) and the gang are great to work with, but where are the anecdotes? Yes, the best thing about The Simpsons is its brilliant ability to tackle difficult issues, often encapsulating them in a line, but then at least remind us of this, don't just nod to it. There is a wholesome quality to this show at odds with The Simpsons phenomenon; while the television series works on different levels, this show is straight down the line. Bart Simpson is an irreverent, mischievous little boy. Nancy Cartwright is an enthusiastic, rather saccharine, woman (but with a little girl trapped inside). Of course she knows her character inside out and when Bart's voice comes from within (and there is a touch of The Exorcist about this skill) she knows exactly what he would say in a given situation. However, what Bart would make of Nancy dancing round the stage to M C Hammer was wisely left unsaid. The similarity between the television show and Cartwright's stage show is that they are both accessible and broken up into digestible chunks. Cartwright has a lot of ground to cover, and she handles certain elements very well. Without wishing to be cynical, it seemed that the story of how a celebrity helped a terminally ill child to die happy might not be far away, but when it came it was moving, dignified and genuinely felt. You cannot help but be impressed with the devotion The Simpsons engenders. Within this show there was a brief quiz where Simpsons geeks were asked the most obscure questions before one delighted winner literally skipped off with some merchandise. That kind of fan will love the show whatever but neither they nor anyone else will leave feeling much the wiser about Bart and his iconic family.

Topics Most popular Stage Back to top ", "", " Links Articles News Reviews Amateur Theatre Contact Other Resources Fatboy By John Clancy Assembly Rooms *** Fatboy, played by Mike McShane, is an Ubu-like, obnoxious, selfish, dirty, lazy and, obviously, fat man who robs, cheats, lies and even murders to get whatever he wants without having to work for it. His wife, Fudgy, is just as obnoxious and devious, if not as fat. The play is in three short acts: the first in Fatboy's filthy house, the second in a courtroom and the third in Fatboy's palace when he is king. The production uses a strikingly designed set, which uses a fake proscenium which has obviously been painted on canvas together with a painted canvas pretend-red velvet curtain, painted scenery and flat, painted props. The costume and make-up design is also non-naturalistic, creating grotesque caricatures with make-up and padding to various parts of the body. The heavy use of footlights also helps to give the characters a grotesque appearance. The performances are all excellent, particularly McShane as the totally unlikeable title character. However the material they are working with is poor, using constant streams of shouted profanity in an attempt, presumably, to shock and with little other purpose. There are moments when the play relates the activities and attitudes of Fatboy to wider political themes, but these are rare and sometimes contrived. Overall, this appears to be a production with a very talented team working very hard to try to save poor material. There is a line when Fatboy is contemplating his own death when he says, \"I fear the end\". Unfortunately many of the audience were looking forward to it, and quite a few left without waiting for it. It was rather sad at the end when the cast were starting to come on for a second bow and McShane shouted \"No!\" to them when he saw that half of the remaining spectators had already run towards the exits. Whatever the merits of the play (very few) and the production (rather more), the performers deserved their applause for their own committed and often inspired contributions to this production. David Chadderton The Grapes of Wrath By John Steinbeck, adapted by Frank Galati C ***** A two-and-a-half-hour production of a John Steinbeck novel performed by an American university at eleven o'clock in the morning is not something likely to pull in mass audiences, especially on such a wet morning. However Pepperdine University's production of The Grapes of Wrath is well worth braving the rain for. From the opening moments when the whole cast of nearly thirty performers harmonised beautifully in the opening song, it was clear that this was to be a high quality production. The production fuses Steinbeck's story with the music of Woody Guthrie, and all music is played and sung live by the company. This is a true ensemble production, with the large cast collaborating to play various parts, move scenery, sing, narrate and play quite an array of instruments. They manage to bring vividly to life Steinbeck's characters and the humour, warmth, strength and pain of his stories. There are no weaknesses at all in this cast; all show a total commitment to their roles during every moment they are on stage. Although this is an ensemble piece, there were particularly exceptional performances from the young actors playing Tom and his mother, with some extremely good support from Tom's father and the ex-preacher Casey. This young cast has managed to create one of the most accomplished, moving and compelling pieces of theatre on the Fringe, which would not, apart from the large size of its cast, look out of place on the stage of the Traverse. David Chadderton Nancy Cartwright: My Life as a 10-Year-Old Boy By Nancy Cartwright, Rose Goss and Peter Kjenaas Assembly Rooms *** Nancy Cartwright is the voice of Bart Simpson, plus Nelson Muntz, Ralph Wiggum and a few others, in The Simpsons. That in itself is enough to sell out the largest performance space in the Assembly Rooms. The show consists of Cartwright talking about her life, relating anecdotes and showing clips from The Simpsons, opening with a sequence on film of nearly ten minutes showing excerpts from her work cut with other clips. The show mostly feels scripted and rehearsed, even though it is trying to give the impression of an off-the-cuff, intimate chat with her fans, and there is more than a touch of Hollywood schmaltz in her delivery (admittedly nowhere near the level of Liza Minnelli, but not exactly down-to-earth either). Technically this is a very slick show, with seamless cuts between Cartwright's speeches and film clips on the large screen behind her (although perhaps they should find a way to avoid displaying the word 'play' on the screen every time the image changes!). The clips themselves are sometimes interesting, but many of them feel like padding; often they consist of clips from The Simpsons that all true fans would probably already have at home on video. There is even a bit of audience participation, where some people from the audience are invited on stage to compete in a Simpsons trivia quiz for a tee shirt. This is interesting and entertaining, but not really a 'must see' even for Simpsons fans, except for those who want to be able to say they've seen live the person who voices their hero.

Second is Lao-tzu. Third is Kahlil Gibran, who owes his place on that list to one book, “The Prophet,” a collection of twenty-six prose poems, delivered as sermons by a fictional wise man in a faraway time and place. Since its publication, in 1923, “The Prophet” has sold more than nine million copies in its American edition alone. There are public schools named for Gibran in Brooklyn and Yonkers. “The Prophet” has been recited at countless weddings and funerals. It is quoted in books and articles on training art teachers, determining criminal responsibility, and enduring ectopic pregnancy, sleep disorders, and the news that your son is gay. Its words turn up in advertisements for marriage counsellors, chiropractors, learning-disabilities specialists, and face cream. “The Prophet” started fast—it sold out its first printing in a month—and then it got faster, until, in the nineteen-sixties, its sales sometimes reached five thousand copies a week. It was the Bible of that decade. But the book’s popularity should not be laid entirely at the door of the hippies. “The Prophet” was a hit long before the sixties (it made good money even during the Depression), and sales after that decade have never been less than healthy—a record all the more impressive in that it is due almost entirely to word of mouth. Apart from a brief effort during the twenties, “The Prophet” has never been advertised. Presumably in honor of this commercial feat, Everyman’s Library has now brought out “Kahlil Gibran: The Collected Works” ($27.50), with a pretty red binding and a gold ribbon for a bookmark. While most people know Gibran only as the author of “The Prophet,” he wrote seventeen books, nine in Arabic and eight in English. The Everyman’s volume contains twelve of them. The critics will no doubt greet it with the same indifference they have shown Gibran ever since his death, in 1931. Even his publisher, Alfred A. Knopf, brushed him off. When Knopf was asked, in 1965, who the audience for “The Prophet” was, he replied that he had no idea. “It must be a cult,” he said—an ungrateful response from the man to whom “The Prophet” had been a cash cow for more than forty years. In 1974, a cousin of the poet’s, also named Kahlil Gibran, and his wife, Jean, published a good biography, “Kahlil Gibran: His Life and World.” Then, in 1998, came the more searching “Prophet: The Life and Times of Kahlil Gibran,” by Robin Waterfield, a translator of ancient Greek literature. But until the first of those books appeared—that is, for forty-three years after Gibran’s death—there was no proper biography of this hugely influential author. Both Waterfield and the Gibrans complain about the literati’s lack of respect for their subject—Waterfield blames it on snobbery, “hard-hearted cynicism”—but the facts they dug up were not such as to improve his reputation. Part of the reason there were no real biographies is that little was known about Gibran’s life, and the reason for that is that he didn’t want it known. One point that seems firm is that he was born in Lebanon, in a village called Bsharri, in 1883. At that time, Lebanon was part of Syria, which in turn was part of the Ottoman Empire. Gibran, by his account, was a brooding, soulful child. From his earliest years, he said, he drew constantly—painting was his first art and, for a long time, as important to him as writing—and he communed with nature. When a storm came, he would rip off his clothes and run out into the torrent in ecstasy. His mother, Kamileh, got others to leave her strange boy alone. “Sometimes,” Gibran later recalled, “she would smile at someone who came in . . . and lay her finger on her lip and say, ‘Hush. He’s not here.’ ” Gibran’s father was not a good provider. He owned a walnut grove, but he didn’t like working it. He preferred drinking and gambling. He eventually got a job as a tax collector, but then he was arrested for embezzlement. Poor before, the family now became destitute. In 1895, Kamileh packed up her four children—Bhutros, Kahlil (then twelve), Marianna, and Sultana—and sailed to America. They settled in Boston, in the South End, a squalid ghetto filled with immigrants from various countries. (Today, it is Boston’s Chinatown.) Kamileh, like many other Syrian immigrants, became a pack peddler; that is, she went door to door, selling lace and linens out of a basket she carried on her back. Within a year, she had put aside enough money to set Bhutros up in a drygoods store. The two girls were sent out to work as seamstresses; neither ever learned to read or write. Kahlil alone was excused from putting food on the table. He went to school, for the first time. He also enrolled in an art class at a nearby settlement house, and through his teacher he was sent to a man named Fred Holland Day. In European art, this was the period of the Decadents. Theosophy, espoused by Madame Blavatsky, became a craze. People went to séances, dabbled in drugs, and scorned the ugly-hearted West in favor of the more spiritual East. Above all, they made a religion of art. Day, thirty-two years old and financially independent, was a leader of the Boston outpost of this movement. He wore a turban, smoked a hookah, and read by candlelight. He did serious work, however. He and his friends founded two arts magazines, and he was a partner in a publishing house that produced exquisite books. By the eighteen-nineties, though, Day’s main interest was photography. He particularly liked to photograph beautiful young boys of “exotic” origin, sometimes nude, sometimes in their native costumes, and he often recruited them from the streets of the South End. When the thirteen-year-old Gibran turned up at Day’s door, in 1896, he became one of the models. Day was especially taken with Gibran. He made him his pupil and assistant, and he introduced him to the literature of the nineteenth century, the Romantic poets and their Symbolist inheritors. Robin Waterfield, in his biography, says that this syllabus, with its emphasis on suffering, prophecy, and the religion of love, was the rock on which Gibran built his later style. According to Waterfield, Day also gave Gibran his “pretensions.” Imagine what it was like for a child from the ghetto to walk into this world of comfort and beauty, a world, furthermore, where a person could make a life of art. Fortuitously, Gibran already fitted into Day’s milieu in a small way: he was “Oriental.” Day made a fuss over Gibran’s origins, treated him, Waterfield says, like a “Middle Eastern princeling.” Gibran looked the part. He was very handsome, and also reticent. A later mentor declared him a mystic, “a young prophet.” (This was before he had published anything professionally.) And so he began to see himself that way. Kamileh and Bhutros would not have failed to notice that Kahlil was spending all his time with people he did not introduce them to. They may also have worried about his exposure to Protestantism—they were Christians of the Maronite sect, allied with the Church of Rome—and, indeed, to Day, who was presumably homosexual. In any case, Gibran, at the age of fifteen, was packed off to a Maronite college in Beirut. In his three years there, he apparently decided that he might be a writer as well as a painter. He and a classmate founded a student literary magazine, and he was elected “college poet.” But in 1902 he returned to the South End, and to his family’s troubles. Two weeks before he landed in Boston, Sultana died, of tuberculosis, at the age of fourteen. The following year, Bhutros died, also of t.b. (it was rife in the South End), and then Kamileh, of cancer. Waterfield says that there is no evidence that Gibran mourned any of them for long. It is hard to escape the thought that this ambitious young man was not inconvenienced by the loss of his slum-dwelling family. One member remained, however: his sister Marianna. She adored him, cooked his dinners, made his clothes, and supported the two of them on her earnings from the dressmaker’s shop. Gibran still took no job; art was his job. Soon, he had something to show. Day held an exhibition of Gibran’s drawings in his studio in 1904. They were products of their time, or a slightly earlier time, that of the European Symbolist painters: Puvis de Chavannes, Eugène Carrière, Gustave Moreau. Often, in the foreground, one saw a sort of pileup of faceless humanity, while in the background there hovered a Greater Power—an angel, perhaps, or just a sort of milky miasma, suggestive of mystery and the soul. Gibran began publishing his writings as well: collections of stories and poems, parables and aphorisms. He had been heavily exposed to Lebanon’s political problems: the warring among religious sects, the sufferings of the poor at the hands of a corrupt clergy and the distant Turkish overlords. Anger over this, and also pity—whether for Lebanese peasants or, quite often, for himself—were the main themes of his early writings. They were published in Arabic, and they won him great admiration in the Arab-American community. Not only was he standing up for his homeland; he was “making it” in America—and in art, not in drygoods. He enjoyed this, but he wanted a larger audience, and soon he found the person who would make that possible. Mary Haskell, the headmistress of a girls’ school in Boston, was a New Woman. She believed in long hikes, cold showers, and progressive politics. Her school disdained Latin and Greek; it taught anatomy and current events instead. Before Gibran became close to Haskell, in 1908, he had a history of befriending older women who could be useful to him. Haskell, too, was older, by nine years. (She was also taller. Gibran was five feet three, a source of grief to him all his life.) She was not rich, but by careful thrift—the school’s cook, who also had some wealthy employers, sneaked dinners to her from their kitchens—she managed to put aside enough money to support a number of deserving causes: a Greek immigrant boy who needed boarding-school tuition, and another Greek boy, at Harvard. Then she met Gibran, who would be her most expensive project. In the beginning, her major benefaction to him was simply financial—she gave him money, she paid his rent. In 1908, she sent him to Paris for a year, to study painting. Before he went abroad, they were “just friends,” but once they were apart the talk of friendship turned to letters of love, and when Gibran returned to Boston they became engaged. It was apparently agreed, though, that they would not marry until he felt he had established himself, and somehow this moment never came. Finally, Haskell offered to be his mistress. He wasn’t interested. In a painful passage in her diary, Haskell records how, one night, he said that she was looking thin. On the pretext of showing him that she was actually well fleshed, she took off her clothes and stood before him naked. He kissed one of her breasts, and that was all. She got dressed again. She knew that he had had affairs with other women, but he claimed that he was not “sexually minded,” and furthermore that what she missed in their relationship was actually there. When they were apart, he said, they were together. They didn’t need to have “intercourse”; their whole friendship was “a continued intercourse.” More than sex or marriage, it seems, what Haskell wanted from Gibran was simply to be acknowledged as the woman in his life. As she told her diary, she wanted people to “know he loved me because it was the greatest honor I had and I wanted credit for it—wanted the fame of his loving me.” But he would not introduce her to his friends. “Poor Mary!” Waterfield says. Amen to that. Later, Gibran told journalists many lies about his childhood, and, according to the Gibrans’ biography, he seems to have tried these out first on Haskell. He was of noble birth, he said. His father’s family had a palace in Bsharri, where they kept tigers for pets. His mother’s family was the richest in Lebanon. They owned immense properties, “whole towns.” He, as a young aristocrat, had been educated at home, by English, French, and German tutors. He was sure that a great destiny awaited him. She believed this even more than he, and in the beginning her adulation was probably as important to him as her money. “Oh Glorious Kahlil!!” she wrote in her diary. “Transcendent, timeless spirit!” When he read to her from an early book of his, she reported that “the invisible” gathered so thickly around her, “lights and sounds came from such far times and spaces, that from center to circumference I trembled with the excessive life-force”—a remarkable response, in view of the fact that the book was in Arabic, a language she did not then understand. She recorded the extraordinary experiences he told her he had had. For instance, he had intuited the theory of relativity before Einstein; he just hadn’t written it down. Thousands of times, he said, he had been sucked up into the air as dew, and “risen into clouds, then fallen as rain. . . . I’ve been a rock too, but I’m more of an air person.” We don’t know how much of this Haskell believed. Furthermore, however godlike she found him, she was a schoolmistress, and she tried to educate him. On the pretext of their having a nice literary evening together, she would get him to read to her from the classic authors, exactly as Fred Holland Day had done, and for the same reason—to improve his English. He profited from this, and of course resented it, as he resented the amount of money he had taken from her—by 1913, after five years of friendship, this came to $7,440, equal to almost a hundred and fifty thousand dollars today—but he didn’t tell her to stop writing the checks. Soon after Gibran became “engaged” to Haskell, he told her that he was leaving town. Boston was a backwater. New York was where the action was. Clearly, he had another purpose as well: to get away from Haskell. He also needed to unload Marianna. If he was to become a major artist, how was he going to explain that he lived with this illiterate woman who followed him around the house with a dust rag? And so, in 1911, throwing off the two women who had supported him through his early period, Gibran moved to New York, and to his middle period. He found a studio apartment in an artists’ housing complex at 51 West Tenth Street. Haskell paid the rent, of course. After a few years in New York, during which he published two more books in Arabic, Gibran made a serious decision: he was going to begin writing in English. To do this, he needed Haskell’s help, and she rushed to give it. When they were apart, he sent her his manuscripts, and she sent back corrections. When they were together—she visited him often (sleeping elsewhere)—he dictated his work to her. She wrote in her diary that if, during that process, “we come to a part that I question, we stop then and there.” Who resolved the question? We don’t know. She said that “he always gave every idea, and I simply found the phrases sometimes.” But finding the phrases is a large part of writing. For Gibran’s first English-language publication, a brief poem, Haskell sent him seven pages of proposed corrections. She probably made substantial changes in his later work as well. Proud of this responsible role in his life, she gave up hoping for more. In 1926, with no objections from Gibran, she married a rich relative. But at night, after her husband went to bed, she would work on Gibran’s manuscripts. Until he died, she edited all his English-language books. With the third of these, “The Prophet,” he hit pay dirt. What made “The Prophet” so fantastically successful? At the opening of the book, we are told that Almustafa, a holy man, has been living in exile, in a city called Orphalese, for twelve years. (When “The Prophet” was published, Gibran had been living in New York, in “exile” from Lebanon, for twelve years.) A ship is now coming to take him back to the island of his birth. Saddened by his departure, people gather around and ask him for his final words of wisdom—on love, on work, on joy and sorrow, and so forth. He obliges, and his lucubrations on these matters occupy most of the book. Almustafa’s advice is not bad: love involves suffering; children should be given their independence. Who, these days, would say otherwise? More than the soundness of its advice, however, the mere fact that “The Prophet” was an advice book—or, more precisely, “inspirational literature”—probably insured a substantial readership at the start. Gibran’s closest counterpart today is the Brazilian sage Paulo Coelho, and his books have sold nearly a hundred million copies. Then, there is the pleasing ambiguity of Almustafa’s counsels. In the manner of horoscopes, the statements are so widely applicable (“your creativity,” “your family problems”) that almost anyone could think that they were addressed to him. At times, Almustafa’s vagueness is such that you can’t figure out what he means. If you look closely, though, you will see that much of the time he is saying something specific; namely, that everything is everything else. Freedom is slavery; waking is dreaming; belief is doubt; joy is pain; death is life. So, whatever you’re doing, you needn’t worry, because you’re also doing the opposite. Such paradoxes, which Gibran had used for years to keep Haskell out of his bed, now became his favorite literary device. They appeal not only by their seeming correction of conventional wisdom but also by their hypnotic power, their negation of rational processes. Also, the book sounds religious, which it is, in a way. Gibran was familiar with Buddhist and Muslim holy books, and above all with the Bible, in both its Arabic and King James translations. (Those paradoxes of his come partly from the Sermon on the Mount.) In “The Prophet” he Osterized all these into a warm, smooth, interconfessional soup that was perfect for twentieth-century readers, many of whom longed for the comforts of religion but did not wish to pledge allegiance to any church, let alone to any deity who might have left a record of how he wanted them to behave. It is no surprise that when those two trends—anti-authoritarianism and a nostalgia for sanctity—came together and produced the sixties, “The Prophet” ’s sales climaxed. Nor is the spirit of the sixties gone from our world. It survives in the New Age movement—of which Gibran was a midwife—and that market may be what Everyman’s had in mind when it decided to issue the new collection. Furthermore, “The Prophet” is comforting. Gibran told Haskell that the whole meaning of the book was “You are far far greater than you know—and All is well.” To people in doubt or in trouble, that is good news. Reportedly, the book is popular in prisons. Finally, “The Prophet” is short—ninety-six pages in its original edition, with margins you could drive a truck through—a selling point not to be dismissed. And, since the text is in small, detachable sections, you can make it even shorter, by just dipping into it here and there, as some people do with the Bible. My guess is that plenty of its fans have not read it from cover to cover. There is a better book by Gibran, “Jesus, the Son of Man,” which was published five years after “The Prophet.” This is his second-most-popular work, but way second. That, no doubt, is because it lacks the something-for-everyone quality of its predecessor. “Jesus” is about Jesus. Also, it is not a book of advice or consolation. It is a novel of sorts, a collection of seventy-nine statements by people remembering Christ. Some of the speakers are known to us—Pontius Pilate, Mary Magdalene—but others are inventions: a Lebanese sheepherder, a Greek apothecary. They all speak as if they were being interviewed. Though Gibran thought of himself as an admirer of all religions, he had an obsession with Jesus. He told Haskell that Jesus came to him in dreams. The two of them ate watercress together, and Jesus told him special things—for example, parables that didn’t make it into the Gospels. On occasion, Gibran clearly saw himself as Jesus, and presumably it was this that inspired his unwise decision, in “Jesus, the Son of Man,” to rewrite long sections of the Bible, for example, the Lord’s Prayer: “Our Father in earth and heaven, sacred is Thy name. Thy will be done with us, even as in space.” Much of the book transcends such follies, however. Gibran at one time had hoped to be a playwright, and “Jesus” shows a gift for characterization and “voice”—an insistence, for the moment, on one speaker’s point of view—that saves the book from his habitual gassiness. Also, however much he imagined himself as Jesus, in this book alone he drops the oracular tone that is so oppressive in the rest of his work. A number of the speakers have complaints about Jesus. Judas is allowed to justify his crime: “I thought He had chosen me a captain of His chariots, and a chief man of His warriors.” Judas’s disgraced mother is given a dignified and moving speech: “I beg you to question me no further about my son. I loved him and I shall love him forevermore. If love were in the flesh I would burn it out with hot irons and be at peace. But it is in the soul, unreachable. And now I would speak no more. Go question another woman more honored than the mother of Judas. Go to the mother of Jesus.” Hard words. In contrast to “The Prophet,” which received few and tepid reviews, “Jesus, the Son of Man” was praised by critics, but these were mostly newspaper critics. While the literary journals paid some attention to Gibran early on, they eventually dropped him. This is no surprise. His leading traits—idealism, vagueness, sentimentality—were exactly what the young writers of the twenties were running away from. Consequently, he did not make the scene with Manhattan’s better class of artists. He seldom turns up in literary memoirs of the period. Edmund Wilson, in his journal of the twenties, says that “Gibran the Persian” was at a dinner party that a friend of his attended. That’s the only mention he gets. But, if the artists of the time were throwing off idealism and sentiment, ordinary people were not. They wanted to hear about their souls, and Sinclair Lewis was not obliging them. Hence the popularity of “The Prophet” with the general public. After its publication, Gibran received bags of fan mail. He was also besieged by visitors, mostly female. Interestingly, in view of his hunger for fame, he did not enjoy these attentions. He took to spending months of the year in Boston, with Marianna, and, though he was now making money, he didn’t change his way of living, or even his apartment. He remained in his one-room studio to the end of his life. Apparently, its monastic simplicity pleased him. He called it the Hermitage and lit it with candles. His reclusiveness increased as his productivity decreased. After “Jesus, the Son of Man,” he was more or less played out. He produced two more books in English, but they were tired little things, and the reviewers said so. When Gibran was in Paris, he met Rodin, and he later claimed that the famous old sculptor had called him “the William Blake of the twentieth century.” This tribute was probably of Gibran’s manufacture, not Rodin’s, but people at Knopf liked it, and so it was bannered on Gibran’s publicity flyers. (Rodin couldn’t protest; he was dead.) After “The Prophet,” the critics, already annoyed by that book’s popularity, threw the phrase back in Gibran’s face. “Blake?” they asked. By his forties, Gibran was a sick man. He had long complained of a periodic illness, which he called the flu. Now he decided that the malady was not in his body but in his soul. There was a great book inside him—greater than “The Prophet”—but he couldn’t get it out. He had another difficulty: alcoholism, a situation that may have developed soon after “The Prophet” was published, or while he was writing it. Robin Waterfield thinks that Gibran’s basic problem may have been a feeling of hypocrisy, in that his life so contradicted his pose as a holy man. In his last years, he stayed closed up in his apartment, occasionally receiving a worthy visitor but mostly drinking arak, a Syrian liquor that Marianna sent to him, apparently by the gallon. By the spring of 1931, he was bedridden, and one morning the woman who brought him his breakfast decided that his condition was dangerous. Gibran was taken to St. Vincent’s Hospital, where he died later that day. The cause of death was recorded as “cirrhosis of the liver with incipient tuberculosis.” Waterfield reports that Gibran’s admirers have greatly stressed the tuberculosis over the cirrhosis. “Nothing incipient kills people,” he objects. His speculation seems to be that Gibran drank himself to death out of a sense of fraudulence and failure. A black comedy ensued. After mobbed memorial services in New York and Boston, Marianna took the body to Lebanon for burial, as Gibran had wished. In Beirut, the casket was opened, and the minister of education pinned a medal on Gibran’s chest. Then began the eighty-mile trek to Bsharri, with an honor guard of three hundred. The road was lined with townspeople, Jean and Kahlil Gibran report in their biography: “Young men in native dress brandished swords and dancing women scattered perfume and flowers before the hearse.” Gibran’s will dictated that Marianna be given his money; Haskell his manuscripts and paintings; and the town of Bsharri all future American royalties on the books published during his lifetime. This last provision produced so many difficulties that it was cited in an American textbook on copyright law. Who, among the people in Bsharri, was going to decide how this money would be distributed? Gibran had said that it was to be spent on good causes. To evaluate them, an administrative committee, with members from each of the town’s seven leading families, was set up, but this created further problems. “Families split apart in the clamor to win a committee position,” Time reported. “Age-old feuds gained new fury, and at least two deaths resulted.” Meanwhile, the funds were disappearing. The situation became such a scandal that in 1967 Knopf started withholding the royalties, which at that point amounted to three hundred thousand dollars a year. Marianna eventually sued Bsharri to win control of the copyrights; the judgment went to the Bsharrians, though, in the process, their legacy was substantially reduced, because the fee that their Lebanese-American lawyer had negotiated with them was an astonishing twenty-five per cent of future royalties. The Bsharrians then sued the lawyer, and they lost. In the end, the Lebanese government intervened and, reportedly, put Gibran’s estate to rights. His coffin rests in a deconsecrated monastery—Mar Sarkis, in Bsharri—that he chose for that purpose. Robin Waterfield has visited it. He says that he found a crack in the cover of the casket and that, when he looked into it, he saw straight through to the back—in other words, that the body had disappeared. This seems a fitting, if sad, conclusion. As Gibran’s mother said, “Hush. He’s not here.” ♦ By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

Told he was a mystic—\"a young prophet\"—he began to see himself that way.Photograph by Fred Holland Day. Royal Photographic Society / National Media Museum / Science & Society Picture LibraryShakespeare, we are told, is the best-selling poet of all time. Second is Lao-tzu. Third is Kahlil Gibran, who owes his place on that list to one book, “The Prophet,” a collection of twenty-six prose poems, delivered as sermons by a fictional wise man in a faraway time and place. Since its publication, in 1923, “The Prophet” has sold more than nine million copies in its American edition alone. There are public schools named for Gibran in Brooklyn and Yonkers. “The Prophet” has been recited at countless weddings and funerals. It is quoted in books and articles on training art teachers, determining criminal responsibility, and enduring ectopic pregnancy, sleep disorders, and the news that your son is gay. Its words turn up in advertisements for marriage counsellors, chiropractors, learning-disabilities specialists, and face cream.“The Prophet” started fast—it sold out its first printing in a month—and then it got faster, until, in the nineteen-sixties, its sales sometimes reached five thousand copies a week. It was the Bible of that decade. But the book’s popularity should not be laid entirely at the door of the hippies. “The Prophet” was a hit long before the sixties (it made good money even during the Depression), and sales after that decade have never been less than healthy—a record all the more impressive in that it is due almost entirely to word of mouth. Apart from a brief effort during the twenties, “The Prophet” has never been advertised. Presumably in honor of this commercial feat, Everyman’s Library has now brought out “Kahlil Gibran: The Collected Works” ($27.50), with a pretty red binding and a gold ribbon for a bookmark. While most people know Gibran only as the author of “The Prophet,” he wrote seventeen books, nine in Arabic and eight in English. The Everyman’s volume contains twelve of them.The critics will no doubt greet it with the same indifference they have shown Gibran ever since his death, in 1931. Even his publisher, Alfred A. Knopf, brushed him off. When Knopf was asked, in 1965, who the audience for “The Prophet” was, he replied that he had no idea. “It must be a cult,” he said—an ungrateful response from the man to whom “The Prophet” had been a cash cow for more than forty years. In 1974, a cousin of the poet’s, also named Kahlil Gibran, and his wife, Jean, published a good biography, “Kahlil Gibran: His Life and World.” Then, in 1998, came the more searching “Prophet: The Life and Times of Kahlil Gibran,” by Robin Waterfield, a translator of ancient Greek literature. But until the first of those books appeared—that is, for forty-three years after Gibran’s death—there was no proper biography of this hugely influential author. Both Waterfield and the Gibrans complain about the literati’s lack of respect for their subject—Waterfield blames it on snobbery, “hard-hearted cynicism”—but the facts they dug up were not such as to improve his reputation.Part of the reason there were no real biographies is that little was known about Gibran’s life, and the reason for that is that he didn’t want it known. One point that seems firm is that he was born in Lebanon, in a village called Bsharri, in 1883. At that time, Lebanon was part of Syria, which in turn was part of the Ottoman Empire. Gibran, by his account, was a brooding, soulful child. From his earliest years, he said, he drew constantly—painting was his first art and, for a long time, as important to him as writing—and he communed with nature. When a storm came, he would rip off his clothes and run out into the torrent in ecstasy. His mother, Kamileh, got others to leave her strange boy alone. “Sometimes,” Gibran later recalled, “she would smile at someone who came in . . . and lay her finger on her lip and say, ‘Hush. He’s not here.’ ”Gibran’s father was not a good provider. He owned a walnut grove, but he didn’t like working it. He preferred drinking and gambling. He eventually got a job as a tax collector, but then he was arrested for embezzlement. Poor before, the family now became destitute. In 1895, Kamileh packed up her four children—Bhutros, Kahlil (then twelve), Marianna, and Sultana—and sailed to America. They settled in Boston, in the South End, a squalid ghetto filled with immigrants from various countries. (Today, it is Boston’s Chinatown.) Kamileh, like many other Syrian immigrants, became a pack peddler; that is, she went door to door, selling lace and linens out of a basket she carried on her back. Within a year, she had put aside enough money to set Bhutros up in a drygoods store. The two girls were sent out to work as seamstresses; neither ever learned to read or write. Kahlil alone was excused from putting food on the table. He went to school, for the first time.He also enrolled in an art class at a nearby settlement house, and through his teacher he was sent to a man named Fred Holland Day. In European art, this was the period of the Decadents. Theosophy, espoused by Madame Blavatsky, became a craze. People went to séances, dabbled in drugs, and scorned the ugly-hearted West in favor of the more spiritual East. Above all, they made a religion of art. Day, thirty-two years old and financially independent, was a leader of the Boston outpost of this movement. He wore a turban, smoked a hookah, and read by candlelight. He did serious work, however. He and his friends founded two arts magazines, and he was a partner in a publishing house that produced exquisite books. By the eighteen-nineties, though, Day’s main interest was photography. He particularly liked to photograph beautiful young boys of “exotic” origin, sometimes nude, sometimes in their native costumes, and he often recruited them from the streets of the South End. When the thirteen-year-old Gibran turned up at Day’s door, in 1896, he became one of the models. Day was especially taken with Gibran. He made him his pupil and assistant, and he introduced him to the literature of the nineteenth century, the Romantic poets and their Symbolist inheritors. Robin Waterfield, in his biography, says that this syllabus, with its emphasis on suffering, prophecy, and the religion of love, was the rock on which Gibran built his later style. According to Waterfield, Day also gave Gibran his “pretensions.” Imagine what it was like for a child from the ghetto to walk into this world of comfort and beauty, a world, furthermore, where a person could make a life of art. Fortuitously, Gibran already fitted into Day’s milieu in a small way: he was “Oriental.” Day made a fuss over Gibran’s origins, treated him, Waterfield says, like a “Middle Eastern princeling.” Gibran looked the part. He was very handsome, and also reticent. A later mentor declared him a mystic, “a young prophet.” (This was before he had published anything professionally.) And so he began to see himself that way.Kamileh and Bhutros would not have failed to notice that Kahlil was spending all his time with people he did not introduce them to. They may also have worried about his exposure to Protestantism—they were Christians of the Maronite sect, allied with the Church of Rome—and, indeed, to Day, who was presumably homosexual. In any case, Gibran, at the age of fifteen, was packed off to a Maronite college in Beirut. In his three years there, he apparently decided that he might be a writer as well as a painter. He and a classmate founded a student literary magazine, and he was elected “college poet.” But in 1902 he returned to the South End, and to his family’s troubles. Two weeks before he landed in Boston, Sultana died, of tuberculosis, at the age of fourteen. The following year, Bhutros died, also of t.b. (it was rife in the South End), and then Kamileh, of cancer. Waterfield says that there is no evidence that Gibran mourned any of them for long. It is hard to escape the thought that this ambitious young man was not inconvenienced by the loss of his slum-dwelling family. One member remained, however: his sister Marianna. She adored him, cooked his dinners, made his clothes, and supported the two of them on her earnings from the dressmaker’s shop. Gibran still took no job; art was his job.Soon, he had something to show. Day held an exhibition of Gibran’s drawings in his studio in 1904. They were products of their time, or a slightly earlier time, that of the European Symbolist painters: Puvis de Chavannes, Eugène Carrière, Gustave Moreau. Often, in the foreground, one saw a sort of pileup of faceless humanity, while in the background there hovered a Greater Power—an angel, perhaps, or just a sort of milky miasma, suggestive of mystery and the soul.Gibran began publishing his writings as well: collections of stories and poems, parables and aphorisms. He had been heavily exposed to Lebanon’s political problems: the warring among religious sects, the sufferings of the poor at the hands of a corrupt clergy and the distant Turkish overlords. Anger over this, and also pity—whether for Lebanese peasants or, quite often, for himself—were the main themes of his early writings. They were published in Arabic, and they won him great admiration in the Arab-American community. Not only was he standing up for his homeland; he was “making it” in America—and in art, not in drygoods.He enjoyed this, but he wanted a larger audience, and soon he found the person who would make that possible. Mary Haskell, the headmistress of a girls’ school in Boston, was a New Woman. She believed in long hikes, cold showers, and progressive politics. Her school disdained Latin and Greek; it taught anatomy and current events instead. Before Gibran became close to Haskell, in 1908, he had a history of befriending older women who could be useful to him. Haskell, too, was older, by nine years. (She was also taller. Gibran was five feet three, a source of grief to him all his life.) She was not rich, but by careful thrift—the school’s cook, who also had some wealthy employers, sneaked dinners to her from their kitchens—she managed to put aside enough money to support a number of deserving causes: a Greek immigrant boy who needed boarding-school tuition, and another Greek boy, at Harvard. Then she met Gibran, who would be her most expensive project.In the beginning, her major benefaction to him was simply financial—she gave him money, she paid his rent. In 1908, she sent him to Paris for a year, to study painting. Before he went abroad, they were “just friends,” but once they were apart the talk of friendship turned to letters of love, and when Gibran returned to Boston they became engaged. It was apparently agreed, though, that they would not marry until he felt he had established himself, and somehow this moment never came. Finally, Haskell offered to be his mistress. He wasn’t interested. In a painful passage in her diary, Haskell records how, one night, he said that she was looking thin. On the pretext of showing him that she was actually well fleshed, she took off her clothes and stood before him naked. He kissed one of her breasts, and that was all. She got dressed again. She knew that he had had affairs with other women, but he claimed that he was not “sexually minded,” and furthermore that what she missed in their relationship was actually there. When they were apart, he said, they were together. They didn’t need to have “intercourse”; their whole friendship was “a continued intercourse.” More than sex or marriage, it seems, what Haskell wanted from Gibran was simply to be acknowledged as the woman in his life. As she told her diary, she wanted people to “know he loved me because it was the greatest honor I had and I wanted credit for it—wanted the fame of his loving me.” But he would not introduce her to his friends. “Poor Mary!” Waterfield says. Amen to that.Later, Gibran told journalists many lies about his childhood, and, according to the Gibrans’ biography, he seems to have tried these out first on Haskell. He was of noble birth, he said. His father’s family had a palace in Bsharri, where they kept tigers for pets. His mother’s family was the richest in Lebanon. They owned immense properties, “whole towns.” He, as a young aristocrat, had been educated at home, by English, French, and German tutors.He was sure that a great destiny awaited him. She believed this even more than he, and in the beginning her adulation was probably as important to him as her money. “Oh Glorious Kahlil!!” she wrote in her diary. “Transcendent, timeless spirit!” When he read to her from an early book of his, she reported that “the invisible” gathered so thickly around her, “lights and sounds came from such far times and spaces, that from center to circumference I trembled with the excessive life-force”—a remarkable response, in view of the fact that the book was in Arabic, a language she did not then understand. She recorded the extraordinary experiences he told her he had had. For instance, he had intuited the theory of relativity before Einstein; he just hadn’t written it down. Thousands of times, he said, he had been sucked up into the air as dew, and “risen into clouds, then fallen as rain. . . . I’ve been a rock too, but I’m more of an air person.”We don’t know how much of this Haskell believed. Furthermore, however godlike she found him, she was a schoolmistress, and she tried to educate him. On the pretext of their having a nice literary evening together, she would get him to read to her from the classic authors, exactly as Fred Holland Day had done, and for the same reason—to improve his English. He profited from this, and of course resented it, as he resented the amount of money he had taken from her—by 1913, after five years of friendship, this came to $7,440, equal to almost a hundred and fifty thousand dollars today—but he didn’t tell her to stop writing the checks.Soon after Gibran became “engaged” to Haskell, he told her that he was leaving town. Boston was a backwater. New York was where the action was. Clearly, he had another purpose as well: to get away from Haskell. He also needed to unload Marianna. If he was to become a major artist, how was he going to explain that he lived with this illiterate woman who followed him around the house with a dust rag? And so, in 1911, throwing off the two women who had supported him through his early period, Gibran moved to New York, and to his middle period. He found a studio apartment in an artists’ housing complex at 51 West Tenth Street. Haskell paid the rent, of course.After a few years in New York, during which he published two more books in Arabic, Gibran made a serious decision: he was going to begin writing in English. To do this, he needed Haskell’s help, and she rushed to give it. When they were apart, he sent her his manuscripts, and she sent back corrections. When they were together—she visited him often (sleeping elsewhere)—he dictated his work to her. She wrote in her diary that if, during that process, “we come to a part that I question, we stop then and there.” Who resolved the question? We don’t know. She said that “he always gave every idea, and I simply found the phrases sometimes.” But finding the phrases is a large part of writing. For Gibran’s first English-language publication, a brief poem, Haskell sent him seven pages of proposed corrections. She probably made substantial changes in his later work as well. Proud of this responsible role in his life, she gave up hoping for more. In 1926, with no objections from Gibran, she married a rich relative. But at night, after her husband went to bed, she would work on Gibran’s manuscripts. Until he died, she edited all his English-language books. With the third of these, “The Prophet,” he hit pay dirt.What made “The Prophet” so fantastically successful? At the opening of the book, we are told that Almustafa, a holy man, has been living in exile, in a city called Orphalese, for twelve years. (When “The Prophet” was published, Gibran had been living in New York, in “exile” from Lebanon, for twelve years.) A ship is now coming to take him back to the island of his birth. Saddened by his departure, people gather around and ask him for his final words of wisdom—on love, on work, on joy and sorrow, and so forth. He obliges, and his lucubrations on these matters occupy most of the book. Almustafa’s advice is not bad: love involves suffering; children should be given their independence. Who, these days, would say otherwise? More than the soundness of its advice, however, the mere fact that “The Prophet” was an advice book—or, more precisely, “inspirational literature”—probably insured a substantial readership at the start. Gibran’s closest counterpart today is the Brazilian sage Paulo Coelho, and his books have sold nearly a hundred million copies.Then, there is the pleasing ambiguity of Almustafa’s counsels. In the manner of horoscopes, the statements are so widely applicable (“your creativity,” “your family problems”) that almost anyone could think that they were addressed to him. At times, Almustafa’s vagueness is such that you can’t figure out what he means. If you look closely, though, you will see that much of the time he is saying something specific; namely, that everything is everything else. Freedom is slavery; waking is dreaming; belief is doubt; joy is pain; death is life. So, whatever you’re doing, you needn’t worry, because you’re also doing the opposite. Such paradoxes, which Gibran had used for years to keep Haskell out of his bed, now became his favorite literary device. They appeal not only by their seeming correction of conventional wisdom but also by their hypnotic power, their negation of rational processes.Also, the book sounds religious, which it is, in a way. Gibran was familiar with Buddhist and Muslim holy books, and above all with the Bible, in both its Arabic and King James translations. (Those paradoxes of his come partly from the Sermon on the Mount.) In “The Prophet” he Osterized all these into a warm, smooth, interconfessional soup that was perfect for twentieth-century readers, many of whom longed for the comforts of religion but did not wish to pledge allegiance to any church, let alone to any deity who might have left a record of how he wanted them to behave. It is no surprise that when those two trends—anti-authoritarianism and a nostalgia for sanctity—came together and produced the sixties, “The Prophet” ’s sales climaxed. Nor is the spirit of the sixties gone from our world. It survives in the New Age movement—of which Gibran was a midwife—and that market may be what Everyman’s had in mind when it decided to issue the new collection.Furthermore, “The Prophet” is comforting. Gibran told Haskell that the whole meaning of the book was “You are far far greater than you know—and All is well.” To people in doubt or in trouble, that is good news. Reportedly, the book is popular in prisons. Finally, “The Prophet” is short—ninety-six pages in its original edition, with margins you could drive a truck through—a selling point not to be dismissed. And, since the text is in small, detachable sections, you can make it even shorter, by just dipping into it here and there, as some people do with the Bible. My guess is that plenty of its fans have not read it from cover to cover.There is a better book by Gibran, “Jesus, the Son of Man,” which was published five years after “The Prophet.” This is his second-most-popular work, but way second. That, no doubt, is because it lacks the something-for-everyone quality of its predecessor. “Jesus” is about Jesus. Also, it is not a book of advice or consolation. It is a novel of sorts, a collection of seventy-nine statements by people remembering Christ. Some of the speakers are known to us—Pontius Pilate, Mary Magdalene—but others are inventions: a Lebanese sheepherder, a Greek apothecary. They all speak as if they were being interviewed.Though Gibran thought of himself as an admirer of all religions, he had an obsession with Jesus. He told Haskell that Jesus came to him in dreams. The two of them ate watercress together, and Jesus told him special things—for example, parables that didn’t make it into the Gospels. On occasion, Gibran clearly saw himself as Jesus, and presumably it was this that inspired his unwise decision, in “Jesus, the Son of Man,” to rewrite long sections of the Bible, for example, the Lord’s Prayer: “Our Father in earth and heaven, sacred is Thy name. Thy will be done with us, even as in space.”Much of the book transcends such follies, however. Gibran at one time had hoped to be a playwright, and “Jesus” shows a gift for characterization and “voice”—an insistence, for the moment, on one speaker’s point of view—that saves the book from his habitual gassiness. Also, however much he imagined himself as Jesus, in this book alone he drops the oracular tone that is so oppressive in the rest of his work. A number of the speakers have complaints about Jesus. Judas is allowed to justify his crime: “I thought He had chosen me a captain of His chariots, and a chief man of His warriors.” Judas’s disgraced mother is given a dignified and moving speech: “I beg you to question me no further about my son. I loved him and I shall love him forevermore. If love were in the flesh I would burn it out with hot irons and be at peace. But it is in the soul, unreachable. And now I would speak no more. Go question another woman more honored than the mother of Judas. Go to the mother of Jesus.” Hard words.In contrast to “The Prophet,” which received few and tepid reviews, “Jesus, the Son of Man” was praised by critics, but these were mostly newspaper critics. While the literary journals paid some attention to Gibran early on, they eventually dropped him. This is no surprise. His leading traits—idealism, vagueness, sentimentality—were exactly what the young writers of the twenties were running away from. Consequently, he did not make the scene with Manhattan’s better class of artists. He seldom turns up in literary memoirs of the period. Edmund Wilson, in his journal of the twenties, says that “Gibran the Persian” was at a dinner party that a friend of his attended. That’s the only mention he gets.But, if the artists of the time were throwing off idealism and sentiment, ordinary people were not. They wanted to hear about their souls, and Sinclair Lewis was not obliging them. Hence the popularity of “The Prophet” with the general public. After its publication, Gibran received bags of fan mail. He was also besieged by visitors, mostly female. Interestingly, in view of his hunger for fame, he did not enjoy these attentions. He took to spending months of the year in Boston, with Marianna, and, though he was now making money, he didn’t change his way of living, or even his apartment. He remained in his one-room studio to the end of his life. Apparently, its monastic simplicity pleased him. He called it the Hermitage and lit it with candles.His reclusiveness increased as his productivity decreased. After “Jesus, the Son of Man,” he was more or less played out. He produced two more books in English, but they were tired little things, and the reviewers said so. When Gibran was in Paris, he met Rodin, and he later claimed that the famous old sculptor had called him “the William Blake of the twentieth century.” This tribute was probably of Gibran’s manufacture, not Rodin’s, but people at Knopf liked it, and so it was bannered on Gibran’s publicity flyers. (Rodin couldn’t protest; he was dead.) After “The Prophet,” the critics, already annoyed by that book’s popularity, threw the phrase back in Gibran’s face. “Blake?” they asked.By his forties, Gibran was a sick man. He had long complained of a periodic illness, which he called the flu. Now he decided that the malady was not in his body but in his soul. There was a great book inside him—greater than “The Prophet”—but he couldn’t get it out. He had another difficulty: alcoholism, a situation that may have developed soon after “The Prophet” was published, or while he was writing it. Robin Waterfield thinks that Gibran’s basic problem may have been a feeling of hypocrisy, in that his life so contradicted his pose as a holy man. In his last years, he stayed closed up in his apartment, occasionally receiving a worthy visitor but mostly drinking arak, a Syrian liquor that Marianna sent to him, apparently by the gallon. By the spring of 1931, he was bedridden, and one morning the woman who brought him his breakfast decided that his condition was dangerous. Gibran was taken to St. Vincent’s Hospital, where he died later that day. The cause of death was recorded as “cirrhosis of the liver with incipient tuberculosis.” Waterfield reports that Gibran’s admirers have greatly stressed the tuberculosis over the cirrhosis. “Nothing incipient kills people,” he objects. His speculation seems to be that Gibran drank himself to death out of a sense of fraudulence and failure.A black comedy ensued. After mobbed memorial services in New York and Boston, Marianna took the body to Lebanon for burial, as Gibran had wished. In Beirut, the casket was opened, and the minister of education pinned a medal on Gibran’s chest. Then began the eighty-mile trek to Bsharri, with an honor guard of three hundred. The road was lined with townspeople, Jean and Kahlil Gibran report in their biography: “Young men in native dress brandished swords and dancing women scattered perfume and flowers before the hearse.”Gibran’s will dictated that Marianna be given his money; Haskell his manuscripts and paintings; and the town of Bsharri all future American royalties on the books published during his lifetime. This last provision produced so many difficulties that it was cited in an American textbook on copyright law. Who, among the people in Bsharri, was going to decide how this money would be distributed? Gibran had said that it was to be spent on good causes. To evaluate them, an administrative committee, with members from each of the town’s seven leading families, was set up, but this created further problems. “Families split apart in the clamor to win a committee position,” Time reported. “Age-old feuds gained new fury, and at least two deaths resulted.” Meanwhile, the funds were disappearing. The situation became such a scandal that in 1967 Knopf started withholding the royalties, which at that point amounted to three hundred thousand dollars a year. Marianna eventually sued Bsharri to win control of the copyrights; the judgment went to the Bsharrians, though, in the process, their legacy was substantially reduced, because the fee that their Lebanese-American lawyer had negotiated with them was an astonishing twenty-five per cent of future royalties. The Bsharrians then sued the lawyer, and they lost.In the end, the Lebanese government intervened and, reportedly, put Gibran’s estate to rights. His coffin rests in a deconsecrated monastery—Mar Sarkis, in Bsharri—that he chose for that purpose. Robin Waterfield has visited it. He says that he found a crack in the cover of the casket and that, when he looked into it, he saw straight through to the back—in other words, that the body had disappeared. This seems a fitting, if sad, conclusion. As Gibran’s mother said, “Hush. He’s not here.” ♦ Close Alert Search Open Navigation Menu Close Alert Books January 7, 2008 Issue By Joan Acocella By Joan Acocella By Gibran in 1897.

On December 3, 1995, Al-Hewar Center in Vienna, Virginia, presented an evening to celebrate the 100th anniversary of Gibran Kahlil Gibran’s arrival in America. After an introduction by Mariam Qasem El-Saad, Dr. Suheil Bushrui presented an intriguing glimpse into the life of this poet who continues to be loved around the world. The following is Dr. Bushrui’s presentation: Notwithstanding the all-important influence of his Arab background and heritage, Kahlil Gibran, the Lebanese-born poet and philosopher, undoubtedly owed much of his success to the country which received him as a young immigrant at the turn of the century. A world of possibilities was opened up to him by the dynamism and materialism of the American way of life, giving rise to the unique East-West synthesis which Gibran’s work represents. Impressed by the great technological achievements of America, and mindful of the material well-being of the majority of its citizens, Gibran viewed his adopted home from the vantage-point of his own cultural heritage and recognized that the picture was incomplete. Consequently he sought to infuse some Eastern mysticism into Western materialism, believing that humanity was best served by a man capable of bestriding the two cultures and acknowledging the virtues of each.[1] His English writings represent the best of both worlds, a richly harmonious blend of East and West. This is especially true of The Prophet, America’s best-selling book of the century after the Bible. Gibran, however, was not only a man from the East who brought a much-needed element of spirituality to the West, he equally became a man of the West, benefiting from an environment in which freedom, democracy and equality of opportunity opened doors before him as would have been possible nowhere else in the world. His achievement thus symbolizes the achievement of America herself, a nation of immigrants which through its ingenuity and largesse has created a truly international society thriving on unity in diversity. America is in some ways entitled to claim Kahlil Gibran for one of her own sons as much as his native Lebanon. For he spent only the first twelve years of his life in Bisharri, the village where he was born in 1883, before emigrating with his family to the United States. Apart from two brief return visits to Lebanon and a two-year studentship in Paris, he lived out the last two-thirds of his life, including virtually all of his adulthood entirely on American soil. He died in New York at the age of 48. It was in America that the spelling of Khalil was rearranged to suit American pronunciation. There he learned and eventually mastered English, the language of The Prophet, Jesus, the Son of Man, and several other books. In America he was also exposed to the avant-garde movements in photography, art, music and literature; his work bears the influence of the Transcendentalists, Emerson and Thoreau, and the poetry of Walt Whitman. The American people appreciated Gibran’s artistic talents as much as his literary achievements. And above all a number of American individuals helped him to establish himself, among them Jessie Beale of Denison House, the photographer Fred Holland Day, and the poetess Josephine Peabody. Much later there was also Alfred Knopf, in 1918 a young and inexperienced publisher, whose remarkable faith in a writer unknown to English-speaking readers was to be richly rewarded. No one deserved Gibran’s thanks more, however, than his good friend and benefactress, Mary Haskell, whose help, financial and otherwise, was unstinting at crucial moments in his career. In the latter part of their friendship, Gibran used Mary as a consultant on his English writings, her role generally being confined to correcting his punctuation and grammar, and occasionally suggesting an alternative word for greater felicity of sound. Beginning in June 1914, he sought her comments on most of his English output as it was being written and rewritten: first The Madman, then The Forerunner, and finally, The Prophet, whose publication in 1923 marked the end of their collaboration. Mary may well have been the inspiration for Almitra in The Prophet, while the city of Orphalese is often said to represent America or perhaps just New York. Gibran moved to New York from Boston in 1912 at the instigation of his fellow Lebanese émigré writer, Ameen Rihani. He found an audience and consciousness far better suited to his aspirations than stately Boston, where his family had settled when they came to America in 1895. “And what can I tell you of New York?” he wrote to Mary. “…I have met many people [with] a saintly respect for art—people who are hungry for the beautiful and the uncommon.”[2] New York thus became his professional home, providing him with the studio at 51 West Tenth Street which he dubbed “The Hermitage,” where he was to produce his finest work. Gibran’s attitude towards America was often ambivalent, perhaps not surprisingly in one who longed for the place of his birth and would himself come to symbolize the struggle to reconcile East and West. At one moment he called it the “best place on earth,”[3] at another he inveighed against “this mechanical and commercial country whose skies are replete with clamor and noise.”[4] Nevertheless, he recognized that “what is real and fine in America is hidden to the foreigner…the real splendor of America is in her ideal of health, her power to organize, her institutions, her management, her efficiency, her ambition.”[5] At times, the enthusiasm of the people of his adopted land almost overwhelmed Gibran. In 1919 he wrote to May Ziadah, a Lebanese writer living in Egypt: The Americans are a mighty people, indefatigable, persistent, unflagging, sleepless and dreamless. If they hate someone, they kill him with indifference; if they love someone, they smother him with kindness. He who wishes to live in New York should keep a sharp sword by him, but in a sheath full of honey; a sword to punish those who like to kill time, and honey to gratify those who are hungry.[6] These words were written a year after the publication of The Madman, which established Gibran’s credentials as a writer to be taken seriously in America. By this time he was already a writer of considerable distinction in Arabic, and in 1920 he crowned this by becoming founder-president of a literary society called Arrabitah (The Pen Bond). The society, made up of leading Arab-American writers including Mikhail Naimy and Naseeb ‘Arida, was to exert enormous and lasting influence on the renaissance in Arab letters, both in America and in other parts of the globe including the Arab world itself. Its members developed a unified approach to Arabic literature and art, and introduced a much-needed spirit of avant-garde experiment into a largely fossilized institution. Fired by Romantic ideals of individual inspiration, pantheism and universal love, they revitalized a great literary language by bringing it closer to the colloquial. Kahlil Gibran was at the forefront of this revolution. In 1925, at the height of his success in America, he was invited to become an officer of the New Orient Society in New York, which was dedicated to the promotion of East-West understanding. Among the contributors to its quarterly journal was the American author Claude Bragdon, who once asked Gibran for his impression of America. His reply was as follows: Conceive of the world as a rose-bush in a sky-garden, with races and civilizations for its blooms. Some flourish, from others the petals are falling, here one is withered, and just beside it, where once was a great red-hearted blossom, only an empty stalk remains to tell the tale. Now on this rose-bush America represents the bud just pressing at its sheath, just ready to blossom: still hard, still green and not yet fragrant, but vigorous and full of life.[7] It was in such a land far from the country of his origins that Gibran, like so many others before and after him, eventually found fame and fortune. But more importantly, inspired by his experiences in America, he strove to resolve cultural and human conflict, in the process developing a unique genre of writing, and transcending the barriers of East and West as few have done before or since. He became not only Gibran of Lebanon, but Gibran of America, indeed Gibran, the voice of global consciousness: a voice which increasingly demands to be heard in the continuing Age of Anxiety. The special place of Kahlil Gibran in the hearts of the American people has recently received dual confirmation in the academic and public spheres. On the one hand a proposal for a Chair in his name has been submitted at the University of Maryland, and on the other hand a memorial garden has been created in his honor in Washington, D.C. The first was an institutional decision by a major U.S. university; the second was the result of a bill passed by Congress, followed by a special commemoration ceremony in May 1991. Gibran must surely be the only immigrant poet ever to have been accorded such academic and national recognition. Kahlil Gibran occupies a unqiue position in the pantheon of the world’s great writers. His best known work, The Prophet, has been translated into some forty different languages, enabling it to be read and appreciated in places as far apart as Tokyo, Delhi, Manila, Nairobi, Rome, Paris, London and New York. The first annotated version, with dual Italian-English text, was published by Biblioteca Universale Rizzoli of Milan in 1992; just one of many indications of a continuing growth in Gibran’s world-wide readership. His stature and importance increase as time passes, for although he died in 1931 and his finest work was published seventy years ago, his message remains as potent and as meaningful today as when he was writing. With its emphasis on the healing process, the universal, the natural, the eternal, the timeless, his work represents a powerful affirmation of faith in the human spirit. Inspired poetry, like religion, carries within it the seed of truth. It communicates by inducing recognition and affirmation: an expression of profound delight at the sheer rightness of the poet’s words, a joy that makes the soul resonate, like a musical note, with a sense of shared truth. Almost involuntarily, from deep inside us, comes the response: “I have always known this;” and for an instant we are placed directly in touch with something greater than ourselves. Fine poetry is the meeting of the human soul with truth. Much of what Gibran wrote achieves this goal while nevertheless remaining essentially very simple. His work abounds with beautiful aphorisms, such as: “Love is a word of light, written by a hand of light, upon a page of light.”[8] Throughout the world, and especially in America and the Arab world, Gibran enjoys a unique reputation. Very few authors in history can match his achievement of writing successfully in two languages, Arabic and English. Few have synthesized the best of Christianity and Islam as he does. And perhaps most important of all, amongst the literature of the twentieth century, with its fashionable emphasis on cynicism, anxiety and despair, his work stands out like a beacon of hope and compassion. Gibran’s name, perhaps more than that of any other modern writer, is synonymous with peace, spiritual values and international understanding. Events around the globe in recent years have underlined all too clearly the continuing relevance of Kahlil Gibran today. His passionate belief in the oneness of mankind, and hence the need to remove man-made barriers, has found a host of reflection in glasnost, the dismantling of the Berlin Wall, the end of the Cold War, the move towards federalism in Europe, and the growing effectiveness of the United Nations Organization—to name some of the more encouraging recent developments. As the name of Gibran’s best-known work implies, his writings have a prophetic quality. He appears, for example, to have anticipated with uncanny accuracy the dreadful cloud that would pass over his own country, Lebanon, in our own times. “Pity the nation divided into fragments, each fragment deeming itself a nation,”[9] he warned somberly in the 1920s. The need for Gibran’s voice to be heeded remains strong. In the sixty years since he died, the Arab world has been transformed beyond recognition by the oil riches that have come its way. While this phenomenon has not been without its benefits, bringing progress in place of stagnation, among some of the wealthier Arabs it has engendered a materialistic approach that runs counter to their spiritual heritage. Religious intolerance, too, thrives in the Middle East as it does nowhere else in the world. These are subjects on which Gibran has much of value to say. One of his most powerful Arabic works, translated into English as Spirits Rebellious, represents a scathing attack on the abuse of religious power. But it is as the voice of reconciliation and consolation that Gibran needs most of all to be heard. His friend and colleague Mikhail Naimy wrote of him: “It would seem that the all-seeing eye perceived our spiritual drought and sent us this rain-bearing cloud to drizzle some relief to our parching souls.”[10] It was also Naimy who said of Gibran and The Prophet: “Such books and such men are our surety that Humanity, despite the fearful dissipation of its incalculable energies and resources, is not yet bankrupt.”[11] The Prophet, this century’s best-selling book after the Bible in America, is full of practical wisdom and simple moral and spiritual values. Its secret is Gibran’s remarkable ability to convey profound truths in simple yet incomparably elegant language; hence his vast international readership, many of whom have shunned other works of a spiritual nature. Never does he attempt to bamboozle his readers or sweep them off their feet with rhetoric. Gibran’s approach enables him to appeal to people of all ages, races, colors and creeds. For today’s world with its striking need for balance and reconciliation between heart and mind, between faith and reason, between spiritual values and the demands of modern technology and progress, there is perhaps no more important message than that contained in the sermon on Reason and Passion: Your soul is oftentimes a battlefield, upon which your reason and your judgment wage war against your passion and your appetite. Would that I could be the peacemaker in your soul, that I might turn the discord and the rivalry of your elements into oneness and melody. But how shall I, unless you yourselves be also the peacemakers, nay, the lovers of all your elements?...[12] Kahlil Gibran was truly a citizen of the world; a man from the East who brought a much-needed element of spirituality to the West; and eventually a man of the West as well, benefiting from an environment in which freedom, democracy and equality of opportunity opened doors for him. His work remains a shining example, on an individual level, of the inspired results that can be forthcoming when cultures merge in a spirit of unity and goodwill. That is surely the watchword for the global society now developing apace as we approach the third millennium. _________________________________________ Suheil Bushrui comes from a similar background to that of Kahlil Gibran having been born and bred in the Middle East, but having spent much of his life in the West.

Kahlil Gibran of America by Dr. Suheil Bushrui Source: The Arab American Dialogue, Vol. 7, No. 3 (January/February 1996). Notwithstanding the all-important influence of his Arab background and heritage, Kahlil Gibran, the Lebanese-born poet and philosopher, undoubtedly owed much of his success to the country which received him as a young immigrant at the turn of the century. A world of possibilities was opened up to him by the dynamism and materialism of the American way of life, giving rise to the unique East-West synthesis which Gibran’s work represents. Impressed by the great technological achievements of America, and mindful of the material well-being of the majority of its citizens, Gibran viewed his adopted home from the vantage-point of his own cultural heritage and recognized that the picture was incomplete. Consequently he sought to infuse some Eastern mysticism into Western materialism, believing that humanity was best served by a man capable of bestriding the two cultures and acknowledging the virtues of each.[1] [1] [1] His English writings represent the best of both worlds, a richly harmonious blend of East and West. This is especially true of The Prophet, America’s best-selling book of the century after the Bible. Gibran, however, was not only a man from the East who brought a much-needed element of spirituality to the West, he equally became a man of the West, benefiting from an environment in which freedom, democracy and equality of opportunity opened doors before him as would have been possible nowhere else in the world. His achievement thus symbolizes the achievement of America herself, a nation of immigrants which through its ingenuity and largesse has created a truly international society thriving on unity in diversity. America is in some ways entitled to claim Kahlil Gibran for one of her own sons as much as his native Lebanon. For he spent only the first twelve years of his life in Bisharri, the village where he was born in 1883, before emigrating with his family to the United States. Apart from two brief return visits to Lebanon and a two-year studentship in Paris, he lived out the last two-thirds of his life, including virtually all of his adulthood entirely on American soil. He died in New York at the age of 48. It was in America that the spelling of Khalil was rearranged to suit American pronunciation. There he learned and eventually mastered English, the language of The Prophet, Jesus, the Son of Man, and several other books. In America he was also exposed to the avant-garde movements in photography, art, music and literature; his work bears the influence of the Transcendentalists, Emerson and Thoreau, and the poetry of Walt Whitman. The American people appreciated Gibran’s artistic talents as much as his literary achievements. And above all a number of American individuals helped him to establish himself, among them Jessie Beale of Denison House, the photographer Fred Holland Day, and the poetess Josephine Peabody. Much later there was also Alfred Knopf, in 1918 a young and inexperienced publisher, whose remarkable faith in a writer unknown to English-speaking readers was to be richly rewarded. No one deserved Gibran’s thanks more, however, than his good friend and benefactress, Mary Haskell, whose help, financial and otherwise, was unstinting at crucial moments in his career. In the latter part of their friendship, Gibran used Mary as a consultant on his English writings, her role generally being confined to correcting his punctuation and grammar, and occasionally suggesting an alternative word for greater felicity of sound. Beginning in June 1914, he sought her comments on most of his English output as it was being written and rewritten: first The Madman, then The Forerunner, and finally, The Prophet, whose publication in 1923 marked the end of their collaboration. Mary may well have been the inspiration for Almitra in The Prophet, while the city of Orphalese is often said to represent America or perhaps just New York. Gibran moved to New York from Boston in 1912 at the instigation of his fellow Lebanese émigré writer, Ameen Rihani. He found an audience and consciousness far better suited to his aspirations than stately Boston, where his family had settled when they came to America in 1895. “And what can I tell you of New York?” he wrote to Mary. “…I have met many people [with] a saintly respect for art—people who are hungry for the beautiful and the uncommon.”[2] New York thus became his professional home, providing him with the studio at 51 West Tenth Street which he dubbed “The Hermitage,” where he was to produce his finest work. [2] [2] Gibran’s attitude towards America was often ambivalent, perhaps not surprisingly in one who longed for the place of his birth and would himself come to symbolize the struggle to reconcile East and West. At one moment he called it the “best place on earth,”[3] at another he inveighed against “this mechanical and commercial country whose skies are replete with clamor and noise.”[4] Nevertheless, he recognized that “what is real and fine in America is hidden to the foreigner…the real splendor of America is in her ideal of health, her power to organize, her institutions, her management, her efficiency, her ambition.”[5] [3] [3] [4] [4] [5] [5] At times, the enthusiasm of the people of his adopted land almost overwhelmed Gibran. In 1919 he wrote to May Ziadah, a Lebanese writer living in Egypt: The Americans are a mighty people, indefatigable, persistent, unflagging, sleepless and dreamless. If they hate someone, they kill him with indifference; if they love someone, they smother him with kindness. He who wishes to live in New York should keep a sharp sword by him, but in a sheath full of honey; a sword to punish those who like to kill time, and honey to gratify those who are hungry.[6] [6] [6] These words were written a year after the publication of The Madman, which established Gibran’s credentials as a writer to be taken seriously in America. By this time he was already a writer of considerable distinction in Arabic, and in 1920 he crowned this by becoming founder-president of a literary society called Arrabitah (The Pen Bond). The society, made up of leading Arab-American writers including Mikhail Naimy and Naseeb ‘Arida, was to exert enormous and lasting influence on the renaissance in Arab letters, both in America and in other parts of the globe including the Arab world itself. Its members developed a unified approach to Arabic literature and art, and introduced a much-needed spirit of avant-garde experiment into a largely fossilized institution. Fired by Romantic ideals of individual inspiration, pantheism and universal love, they revitalized a great literary language by bringing it closer to the colloquial. Kahlil Gibran was at the forefront of this revolution. In 1925, at the height of his success in America, he was invited to become an officer of the New Orient Society in New York, which was dedicated to the promotion of East-West understanding. Among the contributors to its quarterly journal was the American author Claude Bragdon, who once asked Gibran for his impression of America. His reply was as follows: Conceive of the world as a rose-bush in a sky-garden, with races and civilizations for its blooms. Some flourish, from others the petals are falling, here one is withered, and just beside it, where once was a great red-hearted blossom, only an empty stalk remains to tell the tale. Now on this rose-bush America represents the bud just pressing at its sheath, just ready to blossom: still hard, still green and not yet fragrant, but vigorous and full of life.[7] [7] [7] It was in such a land far from the country of his origins that Gibran, like so many others before and after him, eventually found fame and fortune. But more importantly, inspired by his experiences in America, he strove to resolve cultural and human conflict, in the process developing a unique genre of writing, and transcending the barriers of East and West as few have done before or since. He became not only Gibran of Lebanon, but Gibran of America, indeed Gibran, the voice of global consciousness: a voice which increasingly demands to be heard in the continuing Age of Anxiety. The special place of Kahlil Gibran in the hearts of the American people has recently received dual confirmation in the academic and public spheres. On the one hand a proposal for a Chair in his name has been submitted at the University of Maryland, and on the other hand a memorial garden has been created in his honor in Washington, D.C. The first was an institutional decision by a major U.S. university; the second was the result of a bill passed by Congress, followed by a special commemoration ceremony in May 1991. Gibran must surely be the only immigrant poet ever to have been accorded such academic and national recognition. Kahlil Gibran occupies a unqiue position in the pantheon of the world’s great writers. His best known work, The Prophet, has been translated into some forty different languages, enabling it to be read and appreciated in places as far apart as Tokyo, Delhi, Manila, Nairobi, Rome, Paris, London and New York. The first annotated version, with dual Italian-English text, was published by Biblioteca Universale Rizzoli of Milan in 1992; just one of many indications of a continuing growth in Gibran’s world-wide readership. His stature and importance increase as time passes, for although he died in 1931 and his finest work was published seventy years ago, his message remains as potent and as meaningful today as when he was writing. With its emphasis on the healing process, the universal, the natural, the eternal, the timeless, his work represents a powerful affirmation of faith in the human spirit. Inspired poetry, like religion, carries within it the seed of truth. It communicates by inducing recognition and affirmation: an expression of profound delight at the sheer rightness of the poet’s words, a joy that makes the soul resonate, like a musical note, with a sense of shared truth. Almost involuntarily, from deep inside us, comes the response: “I have always known this;” and for an instant we are placed directly in touch with something greater than ourselves. Fine poetry is the meeting of the human soul with truth. Much of what Gibran wrote achieves this goal while nevertheless remaining essentially very simple. His work abounds with beautiful aphorisms, such as: “Love is a word of light, written by a hand of light, upon a page of light.”[8] [8] [8] Throughout the world, and especially in America and the Arab world, Gibran enjoys a unique reputation. Very few authors in history can match his achievement of writing successfully in two languages, Arabic and English. Few have synthesized the best of Christianity and Islam as he does. And perhaps most important of all, amongst the literature of the twentieth century, with its fashionable emphasis on cynicism, anxiety and despair, his work stands out like a beacon of hope and compassion. Gibran’s name, perhaps more than that of any other modern writer, is synonymous with peace, spiritual values and international understanding. Events around the globe in recent years have underlined all too clearly the continuing relevance of Kahlil Gibran today. His passionate belief in the oneness of mankind, and hence the need to remove man-made barriers, has found a host of reflection in glasnost, the dismantling of the Berlin Wall, the end of the Cold War, the move towards federalism in Europe, and the growing effectiveness of the United Nations Organization—to name some of the more encouraging recent developments. As the name of Gibran’s best-known work implies, his writings have a prophetic quality. He appears, for example, to have anticipated with uncanny accuracy the dreadful cloud that would pass over his own country, Lebanon, in our own times. “Pity the nation divided into fragments, each fragment deeming itself a nation,”[9] he warned somberly in the 1920s. [9] [9] The need for Gibran’s voice to be heeded remains strong. In the sixty years since he died, the Arab world has been transformed beyond recognition by the oil riches that have come its way. While this phenomenon has not been without its benefits, bringing progress in place of stagnation, among some of the wealthier Arabs it has engendered a materialistic approach that runs counter to their spiritual heritage. Religious intolerance, too, thrives in the Middle East as it does nowhere else in the world. These are subjects on which Gibran has much of value to say. One of his most powerful Arabic works, translated into English as Spirits Rebellious, represents a scathing attack on the abuse of religious power. But it is as the voice of reconciliation and consolation that Gibran needs most of all to be heard. His friend and colleague Mikhail Naimy wrote of him: “It would seem that the all-seeing eye perceived our spiritual drought and sent us this rain-bearing cloud to drizzle some relief to our parching souls.”[10] [10] [10] It was also Naimy who said of Gibran and The Prophet: “Such books and such men are our surety that Humanity, despite the fearful dissipation of its incalculable energies and resources, is not yet bankrupt.”[11] The Prophet, this century’s best-selling book after the Bible in America, is full of practical wisdom and simple moral and spiritual values. Its secret is Gibran’s remarkable ability to convey profound truths in simple yet incomparably elegant language; hence his vast international readership, many of whom have shunned other works of a spiritual nature. Never does he attempt to bamboozle his readers or sweep them off their feet with rhetoric. Gibran’s approach enables him to appeal to people of all ages, races, colors and creeds. For today’s world with its striking need for balance and reconciliation between heart and mind, between faith and reason, between spiritual values and the demands of modern technology and progress, there is perhaps no more important message than that contained in the sermon on Reason and Passion: [11] [11] Your soul is oftentimes a battlefield, upon which your reason and your judgment wage war against your passion and your appetite. Would that I could be the peacemaker in your soul, that I might turn the discord and the rivalry of your elements into oneness and melody. But how shall I, unless you yourselves be also the peacemakers, nay, the lovers of all your elements?...[12] [12] [12] Kahlil Gibran was truly a citizen of the world; a man from the East who brought a much-needed element of spirituality to the West; and eventually a man of the West as well, benefiting from an environment in which freedom, democracy and equality of opportunity opened doors for him. His work remains a shining example, on an individual level, of the inspired results that can be forthcoming when cultures merge in a spirit of unity and goodwill. That is surely the watchword for the global society now developing apace as we approach the third millennium. _________________________________________ Suheil Bushrui comes from a similar background to that of Kahlil Gibran having been born and bred in the Middle East, but having spent much of his life in the West.

But many critics have been lukewarm about his merits. Why, then, has his seminal work, The Prophet, struck such a chord with generations of readers? Since it was published in 1923, The Prophet has never been out of print. The perennial classic has been translated into more than 50 languages and is a staple on international best-seller lists. It is thought to have sold tens of millions of copies. Although practically ignored by the literary establishment in the West, lines from the book have inspired song lyrics, political speeches and have been read out at weddings and funerals all around the world. \"It serves various occasions or big moments in one's life so it tends to be a book that is often gifted to a lover, or for a birth, or death. That is why it has spread so widely, and by word of mouth,\" says Dr Mohamed Salah Omri, lecturer in Modern Arabic literature at Oxford University. The Beatles, John F Kennedy and Indira Gandhi are among those who have been influenced by its words. \"This book has a way of speaking to people at different stages in their lives. It has this magical quality, the more you read it the more you come to understand the words,\" says Reverend Laurie Sue, an interfaith minister in New York who has conducted hundreds of weddings with readings from The Prophet. \"But it is not filled with any kind of dogma, it is available to anyone whether they are Jewish or Christian or Muslim.\" The book is made up of 26 prose poems, delivered as sermons by a wise man called Al Mustapha. He is about to set sail for his homeland after 12 years in exile on a fictional island when the people of the island ask him to share his wisdom on the big questions of life: love, family, work and death. Its popularity peaked in the 1930s and again in the 1960s when it became the bible of the counter culture. \"Many people turned away from the establishment of the Church to Gibran,\" says Professor Juan Cole, historian of the Middle East at the University of Michigan who has translated several of Gibran's works from Arabic. \"He offered a dogma-free universal spiritualism as opposed to orthodox religion, and his vision of the spiritual was not moralistic. In fact, he urged people to be non-judgmental.\" Despite the immense popularity of his writing, or perhaps because of it, The Prophet was panned by many critics in the West who thought it simplistic, naive and lacking in substance. \"In the West, he was not added to the canon of English literature,\" says Cole. \"Even though his major works were in English after 1918, and though he is one of bestselling poets in American history, he was disdained by English professors.\" \"He was looked down upon as, frankly, a 'bubblehead' by Western academics, because he appealed to the masses. I think he has been misunderstood in the West. He is certainly not a bubblehead, in fact his writings in Arabic are in a very sophisticated style. \"There is no doubt he deserves a place in the Western canon. It is strange to teach English literature and ignore a literary phenomenon.\" Gibran was a painter as well as a writer by training and was schooled in the symbolist tradition in Paris in 1908. He mixed with the intellectual elite of his time, including figures such as WB Yeats, Carl Jung and August Rodin, all of whom he met and painted. Symbolists such as Rodin and the English poet and artist William Blake, who was a big influence on Gibran, favoured romance over realism and it was a movement that was already passe in the 1920s as modernists such as TS Eliot and Ezra Pound were gaining popularity. He painted more than 700 pictures, watercolours and drawings but because most of his paintings were shipped back to Lebanon after his death, they have been overlooked in the West. Professor Suheil Bushrui, who holds the Kahlil Gibran chair for Values and Peace at the University of Maryland, compares Gibran to the English Romantics such as Shelley and Blake, and he says that like Gibran, Blake was dismissed in his own time. \"He was called 'mad Blake'. He is now a major figure in English literature. So the fact that a writer is not taken seriously by the critics is no indication of the value of the work\". In Lebanon, where he was born, he is still celebrated as a literary hero. His style, which broke away from the classical school, pioneered a new Romantic movement in Arabic literature of poetic prose. \"We are talking about a renaissance in modern Arabic literature and this renaissance had at its foundation Gibran's writings,\" says Professor Suheil Bushrui, who holds the Kahlil Gibran Chair for Values and Peace at the University of Maryland. In the Arab world, Gibran is regarded as a rebel, both in a literary and political sense. He emigrated to the US at 12 but returned to study in Lebanon three years later where he witnessed injustices suffered by peasants at the hands of their Ottoman rulers. \"He was a Christian but he saw things being done in the name of Christianity which he could not accept,\" says Bushrui. In his writing, he raged against the oppression of women and the tyranny of the Church and called for freedom from Ottoman rule. \"What he was doing was revolutionary and there were protests against it in the Arab world,\" says Juan Cole. \"So he is viewed in Arabic literature as an innovator, not dissimilar to someone like WB Yeats in the West.\" Political leaders considered his thoughts poisonous to young people and one of his books, Spirit Rebellious, was burnt in the market place in Beirut soon after it was published. By the 1930s, Gibran had become a prominent and charismatic figure within the Lebanese community and New York literary circles. But the success of his writing in English owes much to a woman called Mary Haskell, a progressive Boston school headmistress who became his patron and confidante as well as his editor. Haskell supported him financially throughout his career until the publication of The Prophet in 1923. Their relationship developed into a love affair and although Gibran proposed to her twice, they never married. Haskell's conservative family at that time would never have accepted her marrying an immigrant, says Jean Gibran, who married Kahlil Gibran's godson and his namesake and dedicated five years to writing a biography of the writer. In their book, Jean Gibran and her late husband didn't shy away from the less favourable aspects of the Gibran's character. He was, they admit, known to cultivate his own celebrity. He even went so far as to create a mythology around himself and made pretensions to a noble lineage. But Jean Gibran says that he never claimed to be a saint or prophet. \"As a poor but proud immigrant amongst Boston's elite, he didn't want people to look down on him. He was a fragile human being and aware of his own weaknesses.\" But arguably for Gibran's English readers, none of this mattered much. \"I don't know how many people who picked up The Prophet, read it or gifted it, would actually know about Gibran the man or even want to know,\" says Dr Mohamed Salah Omri. \"Part of the appeal is perhaps that this book could have been written by anybody and that is what we do with scripture.
