On the 25th anniversary of his death, it is right that football remembers the pleasure he gave people and the non-conformity with which he played the game he loved so much. The art form of dribbling might have been invented for the Brazilian, who played with a freedom of spirit and, at times, a reckless disregard for the \"end product\" that is difficult to fathom in a sport now dominated by results. During one game he is said to have bamboozled his marker so much, the defender fell to the floor as Garrincha ran past him. Instead of carrying on, Garrincha dribbled back to his opponent, picked him up off the turf and then carried on down the wing. His biographer, Rui Castro, described the man fans called 'the angel with bent legs' as \"the most amateur footballer professional football ever produced\". Sadly for Garrincha, born in Pau Grande, a province of Rio de Janeiro on 28 October, 1933, this carefree attitude he had to football and life in general caused him many more problems than it did his opponents. For Garrincha was an alcoholic. He was as fond of the local Cachaça as his father, who lost his life to drink. They also both shared more than a passing interest in the opposite sex. Garrincha was married to his childhood sweetheart Nair and she gave birth to eight daughters before he left her in 1965. 606: DEBATE Tell us what you think about Brazil legend Garrincha His decision to move in with Elza Soares, a famous Brazilian samba singer who had also been married before, had Garrincha cast as a villain by the same press that had once feted him. Throw in countless other relationships and Garrincha is believed to have fathered at least 14 children. Despite being unable to get his life into any semblance of order, Garrincha enjoyed remarkable success in his football career. He helped his country to its first two World Cup triumphs in 1958 and 1962, was joint top scorer and named player of the tournament at the second and collected three Rio State Championships with Botafogo to boot. But Garrincha was about so much more than trophies. He helped create the legend of beautiful football, the mythical status which the very name Brazil conjures up around the globe. Before Garrincha and his team-mates arrived at the 1958 World Cup finals in Sweden, Brazil were something of a laughing stock in terms of world football. They were considered second-rate even on their own continent, with Uruguay the dominant force having won the first World Cup in 1930 and then, catastrophically for Brazil, beating the hosts in the Maracana in 1950 to claim their second crown. Garrincha was more of a danger than Pele I believe at the time, a phenomenon, capable of sheer magic Wales' Mel Hopkins, who faced Garrincha in 1958 The 1950 defeat on their own patch, dubbed 'The Fateful Final', had caused such long-lasting scars on the Brazilian game that they went to Sweden with a psychologist in tow, a move almost unheard of at the time. They need not have worried. Garrincha was held back until the third game, against the powerful Russians, and in partnership with Didi, Vava and Pele, he destroyed them. They edged past Wales 1-0, thrashed 13-goal Just Fontaine's France 5-2 and then battered Sweden 5-2 in the final in Stockholm to become the first team to win the World Cup outside their own continent. Former Wales international left-back Mel Hopkins, who lined up directly against Garrincha on 19 June, 1958 in Gothenburg in the World Cup quarter-final, described to BBC Sport the force of nature he was up against that day. \"When he stood and faced you his legs went one way and his body the other, there's no doubt about it, he could have been declared a cripple. But my God could he play,\" said Hopkins, who also won the League and FA Cup double with Tottenham in 1961. Garrincha takes on Hopkins in the 1958 World Cup quarter-final \"He attacked with such pace and I believe he was more of a danger than Pele at the time - he was a phenomenon, capable of sheer magic. \"It was difficult to know which way he was going to go because of his legs and because he was as comfortable on his left foot as his right, so he could cut inside or go down the line and he had a ferocious shot too. \"Garrincha would have been a real star today, no question about it - a superstar.\" Garrincha's place as one of football's all-time greats was assured at the 1962 World Cup finals in Chile. When Pele was injured in the second game, Garrincha took on his mantle as leader of the team and his dazzling displays inspired Brazil to their second crown. He scored twice in the quarters against England, twice more in the semis against the hosts and, despite suffering from a fever, helped his side to a 3-1 win over Czechoslovakia in the finals. The player of the tournament was undoubtedly now a superstar - and he acted like one, too. Garrincha spent money like it was going out of fashion on a variety of friends, hangers-on, girlfriends and his ever-increasing family. I would not have been a three-time World Cup winner without Garrincha Pele By the time the 1966 World Cup came around he was a pale imitation of the real Garrincha, a long-term knee injury enough to curb the electric bursts of speed that had once made him so destructive. His last game in a Brazil shirt was their 3-1 defeat by Hungary - the first time he had ever been on the losing side for his country in his 60th appearance. Pele was injured and did not play in that game, meaning the pair of them never finished on the losing team together in yellow and blue. Garrincha's career was effectively over, though he spent many years drifting around both South America and Europe trying to prolong it. He needed money to support his alcoholism and his family, but he also needed work because it was the only time he could lay off the booze. He was involved in several car crashes, running over his own father once, and then, in April 1969, Garrincha smashed into a lorry and his mother-in-law was killed, an incident which only accelerated his drinking. Soares threw him out after he struck her in a drunken rage and they separated in 1977, Garrincha too consumed by alcohol to be of any use to anyone. Six years later on 20 January, 1983 at the age of 49 - just 21 years after he was widely recognised as the greatest footballer on earth - Garrincha died of cirrhosis of the liver, attached to a drip in a Rio hospital. One of the most extraordinary entertainers sport is ever likely to see passed away in misery, penniless and unable to conquer the demons that cut his life so tragically short.

For Garrincha was an alcoholic. He was as fond of the local Cachaça as his father, who lost his life to drink. They also both shared more than a passing interest in the opposite sex. Garrincha was married to his childhood sweetheart Nair and she gave birth to eight daughters before he left her in 1965. 606: DEBATE Tell us what you think about Brazil legend Garrincha His decision to move in with Elza Soares, a famous Brazilian samba singer who had also been married before, had Garrincha cast as a villain by the same press that had once feted him. Throw in countless other relationships and Garrincha is believed to have fathered at least 14 children. Despite being unable to get his life into any semblance of order, Garrincha enjoyed remarkable success in his football career. He helped his country to its first two World Cup triumphs in 1958 and 1962, was joint top scorer and named player of the tournament at the second and collected three Rio State Championships with Botafogo to boot. But Garrincha was about so much more than trophies. He helped create the legend of beautiful football, the mythical status which the very name Brazil conjures up around the globe. Before Garrincha and his team-mates arrived at the 1958 World Cup finals in Sweden, Brazil were something of a laughing stock in terms of world football. They were considered second-rate even on their own continent, with Uruguay the dominant force having won the first World Cup in 1930 and then, catastrophically for Brazil, beating the hosts in the Maracana in 1950 to claim their second crown. Garrincha was more of a danger than Pele I believe at the time, a phenomenon, capable of sheer magic Wales' Mel Hopkins, who faced Garrincha in 1958 The 1950 defeat on their own patch, dubbed 'The Fateful Final', had caused such long-lasting scars on the Brazilian game that they went to Sweden with a psychologist in tow, a move almost unheard of at the time. They need not have worried. Garrincha was held back until the third game, against the powerful Russians, and in partnership with Didi, Vava and Pele, he destroyed them. They edged past Wales 1-0, thrashed 13-goal Just Fontaine's France 5-2 and then battered Sweden 5-2 in the final in Stockholm to become the first team to win the World Cup outside their own continent. Former Wales international left-back Mel Hopkins, who lined up directly against Garrincha on 19 June, 1958 in Gothenburg in the World Cup quarter-final, described to BBC Sport the force of nature he was up against that day. \"When he stood and faced you his legs went one way and his body the other, there's no doubt about it, he could have been declared a cripple. But my God could he play,\" said Hopkins, who also won the League and FA Cup double with Tottenham in 1961. Garrincha takes on Hopkins in the 1958 World Cup quarter-final \"He attacked with such pace and I believe he was more of a danger than Pele at the time - he was a phenomenon, capable of sheer magic. \"It was difficult to know which way he was going to go because of his legs and because he was as comfortable on his left foot as his right, so he could cut inside or go down the line and he had a ferocious shot too. \"Garrincha would have been a real star today, no question about it - a superstar.\" Garrincha's place as one of football's all-time greats was assured at the 1962 World Cup finals in Chile. When Pele was injured in the second game, Garrincha took on his mantle as leader of the team and his dazzling displays inspired Brazil to their second crown. He scored twice in the quarters against England, twice more in the semis against the hosts and, despite suffering from a fever, helped his side to a 3-1 win over Czechoslovakia in the finals. The player of the tournament was undoubtedly now a superstar - and he acted like one, too. Garrincha spent money like it was going out of fashion on a variety of friends, hangers-on, girlfriends and his ever-increasing family. I would not have been a three-time World Cup winner without Garrincha Pele By the time the 1966 World Cup came around he was a pale imitation of the real Garrincha, a long-term knee injury enough to curb the electric bursts of speed that had once made him so destructive. His last game in a Brazil shirt was their 3-1 defeat by Hungary - the first time he had ever been on the losing side for his country in his 60th appearance. Pele was injured and did not play in that game, meaning the pair of them never finished on the losing team together in yellow and blue. Garrincha's career was effectively over, though he spent many years drifting around both South America and Europe trying to prolong it. He needed money to support his alcoholism and his family, but he also needed work because it was the only time he could lay off the booze. He was involved in several car crashes, running over his own father once, and then, in April 1969, Garrincha smashed into a lorry and his mother-in-law was killed, an incident which only accelerated his drinking. Soares threw him out after he struck her in a drunken rage and they separated in 1977, Garrincha too consumed by alcohol to be of any use to anyone. Six years later on 20 January, 1983 at the age of 49 - just 21 years after he was widely recognised as the greatest footballer on earth - Garrincha died of cirrhosis of the liver, attached to a drip in a Rio hospital. One of the most extraordinary entertainers sport is ever likely to see passed away in misery, penniless and unable to conquer the demons that cut his life so tragically short. Yet the anniversary of his death gives football a chance to pay tribute to one of its greatest sons. Garrincha, the 'joy of the people', must never be forgotten. Garrincha poses in a Botafogo shirt - he spent 12 years with them But put a ball at his feet, and the man they called Garrincha - the little bird - could just about do anything. On the 25th anniversary of his death, it is right that football remembers the pleasure he gave people and the non-conformity with which he played the game he loved so much. The art form of dribbling might have been invented for the Brazilian, who played with a freedom of spirit and, at times, a reckless disregard for the \"end product\" that is difficult to fathom in a sport now dominated by results. During one game he is said to have bamboozled his marker so much, the defender fell to the floor as Garrincha ran past him.

Garrincha was married to his childhood sweetheart Nair and she gave birth to eight daughters before he left her in 1965. 606: DEBATE Tell us what you think about Brazil legend Garrincha His decision to move in with Elza Soares, a famous Brazilian samba singer who had also been married before, had Garrincha cast as a villain by the same press that had once feted him. Throw in countless other relationships and Garrincha is believed to have fathered at least 14 children. Despite being unable to get his life into any semblance of order, Garrincha enjoyed remarkable success in his football career. He helped his country to its first two World Cup triumphs in 1958 and 1962, was joint top scorer and named player of the tournament at the second and collected three Rio State Championships with Botafogo to boot. But Garrincha was about so much more than trophies. He helped create the legend of beautiful football, the mythical status which the very name Brazil conjures up around the globe. Before Garrincha and his team-mates arrived at the 1958 World Cup finals in Sweden, Brazil were something of a laughing stock in terms of world football. They were considered second-rate even on their own continent, with Uruguay the dominant force having won the first World Cup in 1930 and then, catastrophically for Brazil, beating the hosts in the Maracana in 1950 to claim their second crown. Garrincha was more of a danger than Pele I believe at the time, a phenomenon, capable of sheer magic Wales' Mel Hopkins, who faced Garrincha in 1958 The 1950 defeat on their own patch, dubbed 'The Fateful Final', had caused such long-lasting scars on the Brazilian game that they went to Sweden with a psychologist in tow, a move almost unheard of at the time. They need not have worried. Garrincha was held back until the third game, against the powerful Russians, and in partnership with Didi, Vava and Pele, he destroyed them. They edged past Wales 1-0, thrashed 13-goal Just Fontaine's France 5-2 and then battered Sweden 5-2 in the final in Stockholm to become the first team to win the World Cup outside their own continent. Former Wales international left-back Mel Hopkins, who lined up directly against Garrincha on 19 June, 1958 in Gothenburg in the World Cup quarter-final, described to BBC Sport the force of nature he was up against that day. \"When he stood and faced you his legs went one way and his body the other, there's no doubt about it, he could have been declared a cripple. But my God could he play,\" said Hopkins, who also won the League and FA Cup double with Tottenham in 1961. Garrincha takes on Hopkins in the 1958 World Cup quarter-final \"He attacked with such pace and I believe he was more of a danger than Pele at the time - he was a phenomenon, capable of sheer magic. \"It was difficult to know which way he was going to go because of his legs and because he was as comfortable on his left foot as his right, so he could cut inside or go down the line and he had a ferocious shot too. \"Garrincha would have been a real star today, no question about it - a superstar.\" Garrincha's place as one of football's all-time greats was assured at the 1962 World Cup finals in Chile. When Pele was injured in the second game, Garrincha took on his mantle as leader of the team and his dazzling displays inspired Brazil to their second crown. He scored twice in the quarters against England, twice more in the semis against the hosts and, despite suffering from a fever, helped his side to a 3-1 win over Czechoslovakia in the finals. The player of the tournament was undoubtedly now a superstar - and he acted like one, too. Garrincha spent money like it was going out of fashion on a variety of friends, hangers-on, girlfriends and his ever-increasing family. I would not have been a three-time World Cup winner without Garrincha Pele By the time the 1966 World Cup came around he was a pale imitation of the real Garrincha, a long-term knee injury enough to curb the electric bursts of speed that had once made him so destructive. His last game in a Brazil shirt was their 3-1 defeat by Hungary - the first time he had ever been on the losing side for his country in his 60th appearance. Pele was injured and did not play in that game, meaning the pair of them never finished on the losing team together in yellow and blue. Garrincha's career was effectively over, though he spent many years drifting around both South America and Europe trying to prolong it. He needed money to support his alcoholism and his family, but he also needed work because it was the only time he could lay off the booze. He was involved in several car crashes, running over his own father once, and then, in April 1969, Garrincha smashed into a lorry and his mother-in-law was killed, an incident which only accelerated his drinking. Soares threw him out after he struck her in a drunken rage and they separated in 1977, Garrincha too consumed by alcohol to be of any use to anyone. Six years later on 20 January, 1983 at the age of 49 - just 21 years after he was widely recognised as the greatest footballer on earth - Garrincha died of cirrhosis of the liver, attached to a drip in a Rio hospital. One of the most extraordinary entertainers sport is ever likely to see passed away in misery, penniless and unable to conquer the demons that cut his life so tragically short. Yet the anniversary of his death gives football a chance to pay tribute to one of its greatest sons. Garrincha, the 'joy of the people', must never be forgotten. His biographer, Rui Castro, described the man fans called 'the angel with bent legs' as \"the most amateur footballer professional football ever produced\".

He needed money to support his alcoholism and his family, but he also needed work because it was the only time he could lay off the booze. He was involved in several car crashes, running over his own father once, and then, in April 1969, Garrincha smashed into a lorry and his mother-in-law was killed, an incident which only accelerated his drinking. Soares threw him out after he struck her in a drunken rage and they separated in 1977, Garrincha too consumed by alcohol to be of any use to anyone. Six years later on 20 January, 1983 at the age of 49 - just 21 years after he was widely recognised as the greatest footballer on earth - Garrincha died of cirrhosis of the liver, attached to a drip in a Rio hospital. One of the most extraordinary entertainers sport is ever likely to see passed away in misery, penniless and unable to conquer the demons that cut his life so tragically short. Yet the anniversary of his death gives football a chance to pay tribute to one of its greatest sons. Garrincha, the 'joy of the people', must never be forgotten. 606: DEBATE Tell us what you think about Brazil legend Garrincha His decision to move in with Elza Soares, a famous Brazilian samba singer who had also been married before, had Garrincha cast as a villain by the same press that had once feted him. Throw in countless other relationships and Garrincha is believed to have fathered at least 14 children. Despite being unable to get his life into any semblance of order, Garrincha enjoyed remarkable success in his football career. He helped his country to its first two World Cup triumphs in 1958 and 1962, was joint top scorer and named player of the tournament at the second and collected three Rio State Championships with Botafogo to boot. But Garrincha was about so much more than trophies. He helped create the legend of beautiful football, the mythical status which the very name Brazil conjures up around the globe. Before Garrincha and his team-mates arrived at the 1958 World Cup finals in Sweden, Brazil were something of a laughing stock in terms of world football. They were considered second-rate even on their own continent, with Uruguay the dominant force having won the first World Cup in 1930 and then, catastrophically for Brazil, beating the hosts in the Maracana in 1950 to claim their second crown. Garrincha was more of a danger than Pele I believe at the time, a phenomenon, capable of sheer magic Wales' Mel Hopkins, who faced Garrincha in 1958 The 1950 defeat on their own patch, dubbed 'The Fateful Final', had caused such long-lasting scars on the Brazilian game that they went to Sweden with a psychologist in tow, a move almost unheard of at the time. They need not have worried. Garrincha was held back until the third game, against the powerful Russians, and in partnership with Didi, Vava and Pele, he destroyed them. They edged past Wales 1-0, thrashed 13-goal Just Fontaine's France 5-2 and then battered Sweden 5-2 in the final in Stockholm to become the first team to win the World Cup outside their own continent. Former Wales international left-back Mel Hopkins, who lined up directly against Garrincha on 19 June, 1958 in Gothenburg in the World Cup quarter-final, described to BBC Sport the force of nature he was up against that day. \"When he stood and faced you his legs went one way and his body the other, there's no doubt about it, he could have been declared a cripple. But my God could he play,\" said Hopkins, who also won the League and FA Cup double with Tottenham in 1961. Garrincha takes on Hopkins in the 1958 World Cup quarter-final \"He attacked with such pace and I believe he was more of a danger than Pele at the time - he was a phenomenon, capable of sheer magic. \"It was difficult to know which way he was going to go because of his legs and because he was as comfortable on his left foot as his right, so he could cut inside or go down the line and he had a ferocious shot too. \"Garrincha would have been a real star today, no question about it - a superstar.\" Garrincha's place as one of football's all-time greats was assured at the 1962 World Cup finals in Chile. When Pele was injured in the second game, Garrincha took on his mantle as leader of the team and his dazzling displays inspired Brazil to their second crown. He scored twice in the quarters against England, twice more in the semis against the hosts and, despite suffering from a fever, helped his side to a 3-1 win over Czechoslovakia in the finals. The player of the tournament was undoubtedly now a superstar - and he acted like one, too. Garrincha spent money like it was going out of fashion on a variety of friends, hangers-on, girlfriends and his ever-increasing family. I would not have been a three-time World Cup winner without Garrincha Pele By the time the 1966 World Cup came around he was a pale imitation of the real Garrincha, a long-term knee injury enough to curb the electric bursts of speed that had once made him so destructive. His last game in a Brazil shirt was their 3-1 defeat by Hungary - the first time he had ever been on the losing side for his country in his 60th appearance.

Garrincha takes on Hopkins in the 1958 World Cup quarter-final \"He attacked with such pace and I believe he was more of a danger than Pele at the time - he was a phenomenon, capable of sheer magic. \"It was difficult to know which way he was going to go because of his legs and because he was as comfortable on his left foot as his right, so he could cut inside or go down the line and he had a ferocious shot too. \"Garrincha would have been a real star today, no question about it - a superstar.\" Garrincha's place as one of football's all-time greats was assured at the 1962 World Cup finals in Chile. When Pele was injured in the second game, Garrincha took on his mantle as leader of the team and his dazzling displays inspired Brazil to their second crown. He scored twice in the quarters against England, twice more in the semis against the hosts and, despite suffering from a fever, helped his side to a 3-1 win over Czechoslovakia in the finals. The player of the tournament was undoubtedly now a superstar - and he acted like one, too. Garrincha spent money like it was going out of fashion on a variety of friends, hangers-on, girlfriends and his ever-increasing family. I would not have been a three-time World Cup winner without Garrincha Pele By the time the 1966 World Cup came around he was a pale imitation of the real Garrincha, a long-term knee injury enough to curb the electric bursts of speed that had once made him so destructive. His last game in a Brazil shirt was their 3-1 defeat by Hungary - the first time he had ever been on the losing side for his country in his 60th appearance. Pele was injured and did not play in that game, meaning the pair of them never finished on the losing team together in yellow and blue. Garrincha's career was effectively over, though he spent many years drifting around both South America and Europe trying to prolong it. He needed money to support his alcoholism and his family, but he also needed work because it was the only time he could lay off the booze. He was involved in several car crashes, running over his own father once, and then, in April 1969, Garrincha smashed into a lorry and his mother-in-law was killed, an incident which only accelerated his drinking. Soares threw him out after he struck her in a drunken rage and they separated in 1977, Garrincha too consumed by alcohol to be of any use to anyone. Six years later on 20 January, 1983 at the age of 49 - just 21 years after he was widely recognised as the greatest footballer on earth - Garrincha died of cirrhosis of the liver, attached to a drip in a Rio hospital.

The player of the tournament was undoubtedly now a superstar - and he acted like one, too. Garrincha spent money like it was going out of fashion on a variety of friends, hangers-on, girlfriends and his ever-increasing family. I would not have been a three-time World Cup winner without Garrincha Pele By the time the 1966 World Cup came around he was a pale imitation of the real Garrincha, a long-term knee injury enough to curb the electric bursts of speed that had once made him so destructive. His last game in a Brazil shirt was their 3-1 defeat by Hungary - the first time he had ever been on the losing side for his country in his 60th appearance. Pele was injured and did not play in that game, meaning the pair of them never finished on the losing team together in yellow and blue. Garrincha's career was effectively over, though he spent many years drifting around both South America and Europe trying to prolong it. He needed money to support his alcoholism and his family, but he also needed work because it was the only time he could lay off the booze. He was involved in several car crashes, running over his own father once, and then, in April 1969, Garrincha smashed into a lorry and his mother-in-law was killed, an incident which only accelerated his drinking. Soares threw him out after he struck her in a drunken rage and they separated in 1977, Garrincha too consumed by alcohol to be of any use to anyone. Six years later on 20 January, 1983 at the age of 49 - just 21 years after he was widely recognised as the greatest footballer on earth - Garrincha died of cirrhosis of the liver, attached to a drip in a Rio hospital. One of the most extraordinary entertainers sport is ever likely to see passed away in misery, penniless and unable to conquer the demons that cut his life so tragically short. Yet the anniversary of his death gives football a chance to pay tribute to one of its greatest sons. Garrincha, the 'joy of the people', must never be forgotten. \"It was difficult to know which way he was going to go because of his legs and because he was as comfortable on his left foot as his right, so he could cut inside or go down the line and he had a ferocious shot too. \"Garrincha would have been a real star today, no question about it - a superstar.\" Garrincha's place as one of football's all-time greats was assured at the 1962 World Cup finals in Chile.

The epitaph says only: \"Here rests in peace the one who was the Joy of the People -- Mane Garrincha.\" It is a humble resting place for one of the great soccer players of all time but then Garrincha was always true to his roots. He was also one of soccer's original bad boys and his life is a cautionary tale for today's misbehaving celebrities. Garrincha fathered at least 14 children by several women, had a scandalous affair with a pop singer, killed his mother-in-law in a car crash, squandered his money and drank himself into an alcoholic's grave in 1983 at the age of 49. He also delighted fans from South America to Scandinavia and played a crucial role in Brazil's 1958 and 1962 World Cup victories. Brazil never lost when he and Pele played together. \"The club, Botafogo, really should build something better here,\" said cemetery worker Jorge da Souza, who remembers that the funeral crowd was so great that gravestones were smashed. Garrincha's story is back in the public eye just now. A movie \"Garrincha -- Estrela Solitaria\" (Solitary Star), is set to go on release in Brazil. In Britain, Ruy Castro's book \"Garrincha -- the Triumph and Tragedy of Brazil's Forgotten Footballing Hero\" has just been published in English. \"The people talk about King Pele. No, the king is Garrincha,\" said his old friend Malvina, now aged 71 and still living in Pau Grande. LITTLE BIRD Garrincha was born Manuel dos Santos in this factory town nestled among lush mountains. He had crooked legs, one shorter than the other, and the world came to know him by his childhood nickname, which means \"Little Bird.\" He played for the factory team before Botafogo spotted him. He left behind his wife and young family but took a girlfriend with him to Rio. Barely literate, he signed a blank contract. His life was then the proverbial game of two halves -- the glory years then a sad decline as personal problems, drink and injury brought him to ruin. The fans adored him from the start as he waltzed past defenders with his dribbles down the right wing. \"He played for the joy, he played for love,\" Malvina said, sitting outside his cabin in shorts and vest. \"Garrincha could drink the night before and go and play the next day in the Maracana stadium. After the match, back here for a drink. \"Can you see David Beckham going back to his hometown on Saturday night to play with his mates?\" said Andrew Downie, a journalist who translated Castro's book. \"You went to see him play because you knew he would entertain you.\" His greatest triumphs were in the 1958 World Cup in Sweden and the 1962 tournament in Chile. In 1958, the Brazilians met the mighty Soviet Union in the group stage. In what some writers have called the greatest three minutes of soccer ever, Brazil attacked from the start with Garrincha leading the charge. They scored after three minutes, won 2-0, and went on to beat Sweden in the final to become world champions. STORMY AFFAIR Four years later, with Pele sidelined by injury, Garrincha was again the star of the show as Brazil won a second World Cup. As the naked players celebrated in the dressing room, a sultry Brazilian singer named Elza Soares walked in and embraced Garrincha in the shower, thus beginning a stormy affair that lasted for more than 15 years. While the couple lived in Rio, Garrincha's wife and growing family were back in Pau Grande. It turned many Brazilians against him and over the next few years, the rot set in. Botafogo insisted on playing him even as injuries began to take a toll. His consumption of cachaca -- a sugarcane liquor -- became constant. Money troubles added up as he failed to secure lucrative terms. Neighbours in Rio's posh Urca area harassed him and Elza. The pair were attacked when they visited Pau Grande. When a military dictatorship took over Brazil, the couple moved to Rome after a vigilante squad visited their house. In 1980, Rio's Mangueira samba school put him on its carnival parade float. In an episode that features in the film, a shocked nation watched on television as an alcohol-numbed figure in a yellow Brazil shirt sat there oblivious to all around him. A few years later he was dead. Garrincha, though, will always remain a people's player. \"He never forgot where he came from. They love Pele but they don't identify with him,\" Downie told Reuters.

Franklin Edmundo Rijkaard, to give him his full name, was that rare breed of player who could slot seamlessly into more than one position, proving as effective going forward as he was in snuffing out opposing attacks. An imposing defensive midfielder with an eye for a cultured pass, Rijkaard graduated from Ajax’s famed school to become a trusted lieutenant in Arrigo Sacchi’s fabled AC Milan team and Rinus Michels’ Netherlands side. Having successfully made the transition to coaching, he still harbours hopes of getting his hands on the FIFA World Cup™ Trophy - the one prize to evade his grasp during his distinguished career. From Amsterdam streets to Milanese heights Rijkaard was born in Amsterdam on 30 September 1962, just 29 days after a certain Ruud Gullit, who lived a few blocks away in the suburb of Jordaan. As fate would have it, the paths of the two near-neighbours would converge in the years that followed, Rijkaard and Gullit combining to great effect for club and country. Both born to Surinamese fathers – Rijkaard’s having moved to the Netherlands in the 1950s – the two would often square off in improvised football matches on the streets of the Dutch capital, and also ran out together for local club DWS. Impressed by his imposing build and wholehearted commitment, then Ajax coach Leo Beenhakker wasted little time in signing Rijkaard, handing the 17-year-old a first-team debut in a 4-2 league defeat of Go Ahead Eagles in 1980. Consolidating his place in the heart of the defence, Rijkaard would remain there when Beenhakker was succeeded by Kurt Linder, Aad de Mos and then Johan Cruyff. His composure and commanding presence was a major contributing factor in the seven trophies the club won between 1980 and '87, a haul that included three league titles and a UEFA Cup Winners’ Cup. Forthright in his opinions, the young Rijkaard clashed on several occasions with the equally opinionated Cruyff. Deciding to leave Ajax one year after Cruyff’s arrival, Rijkaard moved to Sporting and then Real Zaragoza before becoming reunited with Gullit at AC Milan, who had also acquired the services of another prodigiously gifted Dutchman in Marco van Basten. Had Milan president Silvio Berlusconi had his way, Argentinian attacking midfielder Claudio Borghi would have arrived at the San Siro instead of Rijkaard. Coach Sacchi held firm, however, and decided to align the cultured new arrival with Gullit, Carlo Ancelotti and Demetrio Albertini in midfield. It proved a masterstroke. Winning over Berlusconi and the fans with his power, technique, tactical acumen and elegance on the ball, the 6ft 3ins Rijkaard quickly became known as 'The Hurricane', adding the defensive steel so commonly associated with the Italian game to his characteristically Dutch ball skills. His willingness to push forward in open play and at set-pieces made him a threat to any defence, as he showed in scoring the goal that won Milan the 1990 European Cup final against Benfica. Such was their success with I Rossoneri that the Dutch triumvirate would occupy the first three places in the 1988 Ballon d’Or, which was won by Van Basten. That feat was almost repeated the following year, with Milan skipper Franco Baresi replacing Gullit in second and Rijkaard taking third again. The 1-0 defeat by Marseille in the 1993 UEFA Champions League final marked the end of an era for Milan. Gullit promptly departed for Sampdoria, Van Basten would never play again, retiring two years later after failing to overcome persistent injury problems, while Rijkaard himself left for Louis van Gaal’s Ajax. Occupying a central-defensive role with the Dutch giants, he helped them to the 1995 Champions League crown, a triumph secured by a Patrick Kluivert goal in the final against Milan and which brought the curtain down on Rijkaard’s staggeringly successful club career. Oranje delight in '88 Less success would come his way in a 13-year international career, which began on 1 September 1981 when he came on for Gullit in a friendly against Switzerland in Rotterdam. Forming a formidable defensive partnership with Ronald Koeman, he would nevertheless taste glory at UEFA EURO 1988, when the Netherlands won their only title to date by beating Soviet Union in the final. In winning 73 caps for his country, Rijkaard scored ten goals, appeared in two World Cups (Italy 1990 and USA 1994) and one other EURO competition (Sweden 1992). In each of those three tournaments, the Dutch were knocked out by the eventual champions, with the 3-2 quarter-final loss to Brazil at USA 1994 being Rijkaard’s last appearance for the Oranje.

Frank Rijkaard, born on September 30, 1962 in Amsterdam, Netherlands, is a former Dutch football player and current coach. Photo used with permission Frank Rijkaard started his professional career at Ajax Amsterdam in 1980. On August 23, 1980 the midfielder made his debut. In the match against Go Ahead Eagles, he scored his first goal for Ajax. During his first professional year, the young Rijkaard made regular appearances for the team. The following year, Rijkaard was able to celebrate his first championship with the AFC. And in 1982/83 the title was defended. Another national championship was won in 1985. During his first seven years in Amsterdam, three triumphs in the KNVB Cup came alongside the successes in the league. In 1986/87 season, the midfield all-rounder won his first international title in the form of the European Cup of Champions against 1. FC LOK Leipzig. After a short stint at Spanish team Real Saragossa, he joined Italian powerhouse AC Milan for the 1988/89 season, where he became one of the best defensive midfielders in the world. With Rijkaard in defensive midfield, Ruud Gullit as the maestro and Marco van Basten as the goal scoring striker the three of them were responsible for the most successful period in the history of AC Milan. In 1989, they brought back the European Champions Cup against Steaua Bucharest; in the following year they did the same against Benfica. In the final of 1990, Rijkaard scored the only goal in a 1-0 victory, and in 1992 and 1993, they won the Italian championship. In the summer of 1993, Louis van Gaal lured him back to Amsterdam. Right away, the team won the Dutch championship and successfully defended it in 1995. In 1995, they made it all the way to into the final of the European Champions Cup, which had now been renamed the UEFA Champions League. There he faced his old side AC Milan, which his new team managed to overcome, and claimed his third title in that competition. It was after this title that Rijkaard decided to end his successful career. Frank Rijkaard was one of the players who won the title with the Netherlands at the European Football Championship 1988 in Germany. After the historic 2-1 semi-final win against Germany, the Netherlands defeated the Soviet Union 2-0 in the final. Throughout the course of his career, Rijkaard took part in the World Championships of 1990 and 1994, and at the European Championships in Sweden in 1992.

His Iranian father was an Olympic boxer and, by the time he was three-years-old, Andre was considered a tennis prodigy. Having enrolled in the Nick Bollettieri Tennis Academy in Florida at the age of 13, Andre excelled and turned pro when he was only 16. Six championship wins in 1988 saw him quickly rise to number 4 in the rankings. However, despite attracting a fair amount of press attention for his fashion sense and bad boy image, Andre had to wait until 1992 for his first big win. Due to his dislike of the grass surface and the all-white dress code, Andre avoided competing at Wimbledon from 1988-1990. However, thanks to a last minute decision to take part in 1992, he raced through the tournament and saw off the might of Goran Ivanisevic at the grand final to claim victory. After a bad year in 1993, Andre hired Brad Gilbert as his coach and soon after he became the first un-seeded player since 1930 to win the US Open. The winning streak continued and he achieved a 73-9 record in 1995, winning the Australian Open and reaching the top ranked position in the world. Despite not winning a Grand Slam event in 1996, he did pick up the gold medal at the Olympics. Andre met Brooke Shields in 1993 and, after a four-year courtship, the two married in Carmel, California in 1997. However, while the couple became media darlings, Andre’s career took a turn for the worse. By November 1997, thanks to a bad run and a number of injuries, he sank to a 141 world ranking. This career low put a strain on his marriage and after filing for divorce from Shields in April 1999, Andre threw himself into a strict exercise regime. In June of that year, he became only the 5th player in history to win all four Grand Slams and by the end of 1999, he was ranked number one in the world. A return to form saw Andre win two straight Australian Open championships in 2000 and 2001. During 2001, he won 49 career singles championships and $23,502,790 in prize money. He had a record of 689 wins and 220 losses in singles matches. Agassi married fellow tennis player Steffi Graf in 2001 and the couple have two children. While continuing to play, off the court he devotes much time to the Andre Agassi Charitable Foundation. The last match between Agassi and Pete Sampras was in the final at the 2002 US Open. Being the last match of Sampras’ career, it was fortuitous for him that he beat Agassi. By the end of 2002, Agassi finished at number two overall, becoming the oldest tennis player to do so, at 32 years and 8 months. Winning his eighth Grand Slam title at the Australian Open and his sixth Miami Masters in 2003, he surpassed his wife Steffi Graf who is five-time winner of the event. In 2004, Agassi won the Cincinnati Masters and in 2005, he left Nike after a 17-year alliance, and signed an endorsement deal with Adidas. Having qualified for the 2005 Masters Cup in Shanghai, Agassi was forced to withdraw due to an injury. He had torn ligaments in his ankle playing racquetball three weeks before and had been advised to keep off his feet. This injury also forced him to withdraw from the 2006 Australian Open and, coupled with back and leg pain, seemed to plague him in the other tournaments he was playing. It was obvious to those watching, that Agassi was not quite on his usual form and he seemed extremely disappointed that his injuries were preventing him form achieving the wins he desired. Agassi opted out of the entire clay season and as a result, his ranking fell into the 20s After twenty years in professional tennis, on 24 June 2004 Agassi announced he would be retiring from tennis following the 2006 US Open. His final match was against Benjamin Becker on 3 September 2006 and Agassi lost in four sets, in the third round. He bade the crowd an emotional goodbye with the following words: “The scoreboard says I lost today, but what the scoreboard doesn’t say is what it is I have found. Over the last twenty-one years, I have found loyalty: you have pulled for me on the court and also in life. I have found inspiration: you have willed me to succeed, sometimes even in my lowest moments. And I’ve found generosity: you have given me your shoulders to stand on to reach for my dreams, dreams I could never have reached without you. Over the last twenty-one years, I have found you and I will take you and the memory of you with me for the rest of my life. Thank you.” Fresh off the press, Bio.

I got selected to tour Malaysia with the under fourteen national side I made that trip twice. Then I got into Royal College Colombo at grade nine level there too I was able to display my abilities upto the under 19 level and was selected to represent the country at the under 19 ‘World Cup.’ Last year I was able to become the ‘Best Bat’ in ‘Premier 1league.’To be the opening bat in the national side did you open batting in your school days?I played as a middle-order batsman but opened batting whenever called upon to do so.Did you imagine then that you would one day be playing in the national side?Yes, I had great belief. Even from the younger days it was my wish to be a cricketer. So to achieve my target I always played the game hard. When I was playing under 19 cricket I met Dinesh Chandimal. Due to our performances both of us received scholarships to go abroad but could not do it. A few days later Chandimal got into the ‘National Pool.’ I waited for my turn in hope and got it only during the recent Australian tour. Were you under pressure facing upto the strong Australian attack as an opener?Since I had already played in one-day games, in T20s I did not encounter any pressure. Those wickets were good for pace bowlers. I went to the wicket with one idea I will make use of the fast wickets and hit hard at the pace bowlers. That way they would not be able to get the better off us since we would not be showing them we were down mentally so I played accordingly disguising that kind of show.Were you given advice by the senior members of the team?As a rookie in the side everyone put my mind at ease. Both ‘Aiyas’ Mahela and Dilshan encouraged me saying don’t worry just play your normal game, they never pressurized me. The team was all happy at my aggressive play in some of the games. I was happy with my performance as a rookie. What did your parents tell you the way you scored runs from the very first time you played? My mother PV Swarnalatha is a housewife and my father Kithsiri Perera a businessman. My elder brother is Sanjeewa my younger sister is Udara they are not into sports. They were both taken up with my abilities as a cricketer from my young days. They were overjoyed when I entered the national team and delighted when I performed well in my first game. I had their blessings all the way and at all times.Recently many youngsters were called up for the national squad, but, only a few survived. Is surviving there a challenge to you too?I agree with you. One gets into the national squad by showing off talent a very difficult exercise. To survive one has to be ever more dedicated and willing to work even harder. I am doing my best to keep up with my training well and keeping my body fitness. You will survive only until you’re performing at top level I believe I can reach that.Is all-round ability a must for survival in the team?The inclusion of more all-rounders in the side definitely helps in winning games. But I am better at batting. To fill in the gap I have taken up the role of a hard hitter at batting and being a good wicket keeper. You will now have to eat better and carefully chose what you eat don’t you?Yes now those favourite food and drinks have to be limited to keep a well balanced figure. If that is not so it will be difficult to get into the squad: Before a tour there is a fitness test and you have to get through. Therefore I think of these more seriously than before. To achieve your goals are there cricketers you copy or follow in your life?Sanath Jayasuriya is my hero I loved the way he played his shots hard. That is why I too like to play my shots hard.Any future plans?To improve and showcase my abilities in the cricketing arena by being in the national team and do well and play in it for a long period.Who are the people who helped you get there with cricket?My first cricket coach at Dharmapala Kottawa was Duminda Gunasekara sir and especially coach Chulaka Amarasinghe sir at Royal College for helping me to get started. And those who helped me get there I thank them all.Did you not go under the hammer in the recent IPL auction?Yes. My name was included and I am happy for that I will get the chance to play with international stars and see it as a good experience.

", "", " Home Sunday, 22 March 2009 observer ONLINE OTHER PUBLICATIONS OTHER LINKS Jatila KARAWITA Prolific run-getter and wicket-keeper Kusal Janith Perera produced a terrific all-round display (55 & 5 victims) to clinch the Player of the Match honours as Royal crushed S. Thomas’ by 5 wickets to regain the coveted Mustangs Trophy after four years, in their traditional limited overs cricket encounter ended at SSC grounds, last evening. Set a modest victory target of 159 in 50 overs at an asking rate of 3.16 runs per over, Royal romped home with almost 16 overs to spare on the back of vice captain Kusal Janith Perera’s workmanlike 55. Perera, who came to bat with the total at 2 for 79 eventually steered the Reid Avenue side home while raising a 56-run stand for the fifth wicket off 71 deliveries with Haroon Mowjood who remained unbeaten on 12. His top-score of 55 came off 51 balls and was spiced with three boundaries and a six while opener Sahan Hettiarachchi (32) and one drop bat Banuka Rajapakse (28) also made handy contributions to overhaul the opposition total despite a minor - wobble at 4 for 98. Rajapakse one of the two Royal batsmen along with Kithruwan Vithanage to have topped 1000 runs for the season, made a run a ball knock, stroking three boundaries and clouting a six while Hettiarachchi faced 44 balls and struck five boundaries as the Thomians tried desperately to defend a moderate total on a placid track. S. Thomas’ no doubt did their best to stretch Royal all the way with off-spinner Faheem Saleem the big match hero claiming impressive figures of 3 for 32 in his quota of 10 overs, but the paltry total they made proved costly. Earlier, Wicket-keeper Kusal Janith showed his powers behind the stumps by having a hand in five dismissals and a run out as S. Thomas’ inserted by Royal captain Yasitha Abeykoon struggled from the get go to post a challenging score before being restricted to 158 for 9 in 50 overs. Fifteen-year-old left-handed wicket-keeper batsman Sachin Peiris with 31 off 44 deliveries and with three fours top-scored for the lads from Mount Lavinia, and also was involved in his team’s best partnership of 30-runs for the sixth wicket with Ashen Fernando who made 17. Right-arm medium pacer Bhanuka Rajapakse was the main destroyer with outstanding figures of 4 for 32 as Royal strangled the Thomians never allowing the latter to run away with the game. S.

Like Jayasuriya, he has a second skill - though it is wicketkeeping rather than slow left-arm, and he was part of Sri Lanka's Under-19 teams, before he joined Colts Cricket Club as a senior. At Colts, Perera quickly set about forging a career founded on aggression and reliability in equal parts, and after two seasons, Sri Lanka's selectors could no longer ignore him. An injury to Kumar Sangakkara saw him earn a place in Sri Lanka's limited-overs squad to Australia in January 2012, where his breezy innings made plain his talent - particularly during a 22 not out at the Gabba that took Sri Lanka home in a low-scoring ODI. Though a middle-order batsman by reputation, he was promoted to the position of opener in the two Twenty20s that followed, where he continued to play impactful innings On return to Sri Lanka, Perera hit a first-class double-ton, then a 275-ball 336, and had proved enough to the selectors to be given a central contract and an extended run in the limited-overs sides. Perera hit his maiden ODI century in Mirpur in 2014 to help Sri Lanka complete a 3-0 whitewash over Bangladesh. He then hammered a 17-ball half-century, Sri Lanka's joint-fastest, against Pakistan in Pallekele in July 2015, to equal Jayasuriya's record. A month later Perera was handed his Test debut against India in Colombo. He made twin fifties, becoming only the second Sri Lanka batsman to score two half-centuries on debut. Perera's burgeoning career hit a stumbling block in December 2015 when he was provisionally suspended from international cricket by the ICC, after having failed a dope test. He was recalled from Sri Lanka's tour of New Zealand and subsequently missed a bilateral T20 series in India, Asia Cup, and World T20. His plight appeared bleak when his initial sample tested positive for the performance-enhancing drug, 19-Norandrostenedione, but it grew bleaker when his B sample returned identical results. Perera had strong support from SLC, though, and also spent a substantial amount of his own money in fighting the WADA-approved lab's findings. His campaign to be cleared included a trip to England for a polygraph test, a hair analysis and a separate urine test, as well as substantial coordination with his main legal team, which was based in the UK. All this eventually paid off when his name was cleared in May 2016, bringing his suspension to an end after five months out - the Qatar-based lab's findings were deemed \"unsustainable\" for \"scientific and technical reasons\" by an independent expert hired by the ICC.ESPNcricinfo staff Captains who have kept wicket and opened the batting (5) One-Day Internationals Dismissed for 99 (and 199, 299 etc) (99) One-Day Internationals Most innings before first duck (52) Twenty20 Internationals An exhaustive analysis determining the worth of a batter's Test runs has a great allrounder as the biggest gainer Despite the unusual omissions, the LPL has got several well-known overseas players on board, including Gayle and du Plessis Meanwhile, allrounder Lahiru Madushanka has definitely been ruled out with a fractured collarbone Matches (18) Matches (18) (18) SL v AUS (1) SL v AUS (1) (1) SA-W in ENG (1) SA-W in ENG (1) (1) CWC League 2 (1) CWC League 2 (1) (1) T20WC Qualifier (4) T20WC Qualifier (4) (4) County DIV1 (5) County DIV1 (5) (5) County DIV2 (4) County DIV2 (4) (4) ENG v IND (1) ENG v IND (1) (1) IRE v NZ (1) IRE v NZ (1) (1) RESULT • 2nd TEST • Galle • 2nd TEST & Sri Lanka won by an innings and 39 runs Schedule Schedule Report Report Live • 1st ODI • Northampton • 1st ODI (12.5/50 ov, T:219) ENG Women need 149 runs from 37.1 overs.

["", "", "", "It’s possible the best thing that ever happened to Serena Williams was losing in the first round at this year’s French Open. Ever since she’s been on a tear. She won Wimbledon (singles and doubles), the Olympics (singles and doubles) and now the U.S. Open. Put it this way, if the vast majority of her matches in the past few months were in boxing, they’d have been stopped in the first set due to a TKO. World #1 Victoria Azarenka came within two points of winning the Open. But, through sheer determination, remarkable skill and fighting spirit, Serena clawed her way back from the brink of defeat. She reeled off the last four games to seal her fourth U.S. Open title and enhance her status as one of the greatest players the game has ever seen. Already, Serena is in very elite company. With her 15th singles Slam she’s only 3 away from tying Chris Everett and Martina Navratilova and 7 from equaling Steffi Graf’s 22. (Margaret Court holds the record at 24.) Yes, at almost 31 (birthday on the 26th), Serena was the oldest women’s champion at Flushing Meadows in nearly four decades. And yes, Slams are certainly tougher after age 30. But, if you ask me, watch out tennis historians, here comes Serena Williams. And, until father time finally catches up, there may be no stopping her. Currently, Serena’s 30 Slam titles places her ninth on the all-time list. (15 singles, 13 doubles, and 2 mixed doubles.) She is the most recent player, male or female, to have held all four Grand Slam singles titles simultaneously (2003) and only the fifth woman ever to do so. In doubles, Serena and her sister Venus are unbeaten in Grand Slam finals. And, oh yes, Serena is also a two time winner of the WTA Tour Championships and four Olympic Gold Medals. (Singles in 2012, doubles in 2004, 2008 and 2012.) And, in a recent appearance on the David Letterman Show, Serena predicted that she will play in the 2016 Olympics at Rio De Janeiro. But Serena’s much-heralded career has not been without controversy. Not surprisingly, her father and coach, Richard Williams, was also no stranger to controversy. In the early 90′s, when his daughters were juniors, Richard kept Serena and Venus (1 year older) out of competition. Despite the oft-expressed criticism that his daughters would suffer, Richard boldly predicted that both girls would be #1 and each would win numerous Slams. Most scoffed at Richard’s controversial methods but he would now appear to be prophetic. And yet his unconventional (some would say paranoid) attitudes seemed to hover over the Williams sisters. Some criticized Richard for coaching his daughters to trust no one. Lindsey Davenport, former #1 player, said that when the Williams’ first arrived on the tour she reached out to them but was rebuffed. Davenport who, as a junior battled weight issues, had occasionally experienced fans’ “insensitivity”. As a result, she was familiar with being viewed as an “outsider” and tried to reassure the Williams sisters. But, for whatever reason, her overtures were reportedly not accepted. In 2001, there was more controversy. During the Tennis Master Series tournament in Indian Wells, Venus withdrew just minutes prior to her semifinal match with Serena, claiming an injury. But others contended the withdrawal was due to Richard not wanting his daughters to play each other. Fans were bitterly disappointed when Venus withdrew and Serena was subsequently booed during the championship match against Kim Clijsters and during the trophy presentation. Richard accused the crowds of overt racism. Whatever the truth, neither Williams sister has played Indian Wells since. Then, at the 2009 U.S. Open, there was a rather controversial ending to a semifinal match against Kim Clijsters. It happened when Serena was serving at 5-6 and 15-30 in the second set. She faulted on her first serve and on her second serve the female line judge declared a rarely called foot fault. Serena stormed over and launched into a tirade, “If I could, I would take this ******* ball and shove it down your ******* throat.” (Ouch!) Serena was fined a record $82,500 for the outburst. Ironically, at the post-match press conference Serena said of her temper, “I used to be worse.” While historically tennis fans seem to tolerate (and even enjoy) outbursts from male players going back to Pancho Gonzalez, Ilie Năstase , John McEnroe and Jimmy Connors, they have seemed less inclined to do so with female players. To be honest of course, there are fewer examples. At last year’s Open, Serena came close again in her finals loss to Samantha Stosur (6-2, 6-3.) In the first game of the second set, as Serena hit what was about to be a definitive forehand winner to save a break point, she shouted just before the ball landed. Chair umpire Eva Asderaki of Greece called Williams for a violation and the point was awarded to Stosur. Serena had a “contentious” discussion with Asderaki that included Serena’s saying, “If you ever see me walking down the hall, look the other way.” But that was then and this is now. And what a now it has been for Serena. She seems as “serene” as I’ve ever seen her. In fact, it wouldn’t totally surprise me if Serena winds up with more Slams than Graf and is perceived as the greatest female player of all time. But, given her “occasional outburst”, even if she isn’t I’m not going to be the one to tell her. — An avid tennis fan, Jack Neworth is the co-author of “Men in White”, a screenplay about tennis legend Pancho Gonzalez and his rollercoaster forty-five-year friendship with fellow HOF player Pancho Segura.

Fantastic article about Serena. You’re the greatest! It’s possible the best thing that ever happened to Serena Williams was losing in the first round at this year’s French Open. Ever since she’s been on a tear. She won Wimbledon (singles and doubles), the Olympics (singles and doubles) and now the U.S. Open. Put it this way, if the vast majority of her matches in the past few months were in boxing, they’d have been stopped in the first set due to a TKO.

Venus — with her red, white and blue braids pulled back into a bun — closed out the match on the very grass she has long loved with a backhand volley winner after the Czechs saved a pair of match points. \"We all talk about this, 'We have so many medals,' but to be able to add to that, it's like an unbelievable feeling,\" Venus said. \"You know that in that count, there you are.

The two battled on the tennis court from 1973 to 1988, with Navratilova slightly edging Evert 43-37. Their riveting rivalry sold women’s tennis to the televised world that was just tuning in to tennis shortly after the Open Era began in 1968. It was a master stroke in timing, giving the women’s game legitimacy against the backdrop of Bjorn Borg, John McEnroe, Jimmy Connors, Ivan Lendl and other rising stars in the men’s game. Attracted by the exciting play and often intense animosity of the men's contests, television drew new fans in droves to tennis. Once there, fans remained impressed with the power and drive of the Navratilova serve and volley game, in contrast to the game of the seemingly prim and precise Evert, who dominated from the baseline. Later, as this rivalry died out, it was replaced by contests between the cool and remote Steffi Graf and the exuberant Monica Seles in the next generation. These two varied their approach to the game as serve and volley began to die out. For their part, Graf and Seles both possessed masterful all-court games. No one, however, could have anticipated the next huge change in women’s tennis. When historians of the future look back on the women’s game in tennis, they will most certainly point to one event that changed the course of the game more significantly than any other. When the Williams sisters emerged on the scene in the late 1990s as teenagers, the women’s game changed forever. The serve became more than getting play underway, it became a weapon—the underpinning of the new power game in women’s tennis. The Williams sisters were big, powerful, athletic women who grew to dominate women’s tennis and change the game forever. Their stinging serves alongside potent ground strokes ushered in an era of power players to which women’s tennis had never seen before. Venus may hold the fastest recorded serve, but Serena’s serve is not only powerful, but also consistent, effortless and precise. It has been called the best serve ever in the history of women’s tennis. Both women have been ranked No. 1. Although Serena has held the distinction longer, Venus achieved it first—both top rankings for the sisters began in 2002. They have both been ranked No. 1 in doubles, where they also excel. They reached the top spot in doubles starting in July of 2010. Venus has won 43 singles titles, while Serena holds 45. The main difference comes in major titles, where Venus holds seven career Grand Slam singles titles, while Serena has reached 15 to date. Together they hold 88 singles titles—among those are 22 Grand Slam singles titles, plus each has won a gold medal in singles competition. In women’s doubles, Venus has won 21 titles, Serena 22. Together they have won 13 Grand Slam doubles championships. The sisters have tucked away a career Golden Slam in doubles since they have won the doubles title at each of the Grand Slam venues, and they have won the Olympic gold medal in doubles three times. The sisters also each hold two Grand Slam mixed doubles titles. In total, it is an impressive resume. It appears, moreover, that it is still being written because the sisters show no signs of letting go and moving to the sidelines. When the sisters began their period of domination, it became obvious to their top competitors—players like Martina Hingis and Jennifer Capriati—that power play was the new rule on court. Neither Hingis nor Capriati survived the rigors of the power game. But players like Lindsay Davenport, and later Maria Sharapova, would add to the new wave of power players who began to dominate action in the early 2000s. It meant becoming stronger, more resilient and more proficient, because you not only had to generate power, you had to do so with accurate placement and disguise. Being over six-feet tall became the new sought-after average on court. To negate power, on the other hand, came an even greater generation of counter-punchers who could absorb pace and send it back with purpose. Players like Justine Henin arrived on the scene. The Belgian had to bulk up and hunker down to gain an advantage on the court. The Belgian was only 5'5\" and needed to perfect every stroke to survive against the power players. She did so by gaining strength and focusing, determined to win against her more powerful competitors across the net. In the process, Henin’s backhand became the best on tour. Her will to win became almost maniacal. While the Williams sisters pursued dreams of designing clothes, writing and acting, Henin taped her feet and fought tooth and nail because it cost her that much to win against the bigger more powerful sisters. Eventually, however, power tennis took its toll—even on the big girls. Davenport chose motherhood, Kim Clijsters backed away from her powerful modified all-court game, and Sharapova’s shoulder quit. Henin’s will to win ceased as she stopped dead in her tracks just prior to the French Open in 2008. Henin was the No. 1-ranked player in the world when she abruptly retired, leaving the women’s game in disarray, as the No. 1 ranking bounced from one player to another after May of 2008. Between 2008-2012, Serena and Venus played on, periodically, as they floated in and out of the game—able to come back anytime and reassert themselves in the game they reshaped. There was still no one as dominant as either Williams sister in women's tennis. Various injuries, illnesses and personal conflicts interrupted their play, as the sisters often generated speculation that their interest in tennis waned. Eventually, however, they would find their way back to the sport. After reasserting herself again in 2009, Serena dominated until 2010 when she injured her foot after winning her fourth Wimbledon title at the All England Club. She was out of the game for almost a full year. While she was absent, Caroline Wozniacki took the top spot. Wozniacki was a defensive counter-puncher whose consistency brought her victory after victory while the Williams sisters healed, while Sharapova continued her comeback after shoulder surgery in 2008, and while Clijsters and Henin tried to come back after retirement. Now power tennis is the norm. Players like Petra Kvitova and Sabine Lisicki with their big serves are winning big matches. Others are coming. Sharapova and Serena Williams are back at the top along with the newest No. 1, Victoria Azarenka, who is over six feet and developing power weapons of her own. The power game, as introduced by the Williams sisters over a decade ago, has raised the bar in women’s tennis. Women playing today are stronger, more fit and more able to blast winners from the back of the court. What the women's power game lacks, in contrast to the men’s, is consistency—playing week after week, month after month, at the same high level. Women tend to ebb and flow from high to low, unable to sustain winning from slam to slam—except for, perhaps, Serena Williams at age 31. Once other rising stars in the women's game can add longevity to power, they will have truly arrived. The latest in the sports world, emailed daily. The latest in the sports world, emailed daily.

The two battled on the tennis court from 1973 to 1988, with Navratilova slightly edging Evert 43-37.Their riveting rivalry sold women’s tennis to the televised world that was just tuning in to tennis shortly after the Open Era began in 1968.It was a master stroke in timing, giving the women’s game legitimacy against the backdrop of Bjorn Borg, John McEnroe, Jimmy Connors, Ivan Lendl and other rising stars in the men’s game. Attracted by the exciting play and often intense animosity of the men's contests, television drew new fans in droves to tennis.Once there, fans remained impressed with the power and drive of the Navratilova serve and volley game, in contrast to the game of the seemingly prim and precise Evert, who dominated from the baseline.Later, as this rivalry died out, it was replaced by contests between the cool and remote Steffi Graf and the exuberant Monica Seles in the next generation. These two varied their approach to the game as serve and volley began to die out. For their part, Graf and Seles both possessed masterful all-court games.No one, however, could have anticipated the next huge change in women’s tennis.Video Play Button✨ Watch more top videos, highlights, and B/R original content Right Arrow IconWhen historians of the future look back on the women’s game in tennis, they will most certainly point to one event that changed the course of the game more significantly than any other.When the Williams sisters emerged on the scene in the late 1990s as teenagers, the women’s game changed forever. The serve became more than getting play underway, it became a weapon—the underpinning of the new power game in women’s tennis.The Williams sisters were big, powerful, athletic women who grew to dominate women’s tennis and change the game forever.Their stinging serves alongside potent ground strokes ushered in an era of power players to which women’s tennis had never seen before.Venus may hold the fastest recorded serve, but Serena’s serve is not only powerful, but also consistent, effortless and precise. It has been called the best serve ever in the history of women’s tennis.Both women have been ranked No. 1. Although Serena has held the distinction longer, Venus achieved it first—both top rankings for the sisters began in 2002.They have both been ranked No. 1 in doubles, where they also excel.

Players would slice and dice, chip and charge, serve and volley, in an effort to utilise every shot in the book to outmanoeuvre an opponent. The improvements in racket technology and training methods have transformed the game of tennis since the days of consummate players like Billie Jean King, Chris Evert and Martina Navratilova. Those stars laid the foundations for the game we love today but over the years tennis has been remodelled as a sport of power, athleticism, speed and endurance. While some tennis romanticists deem the new era as one-dimensional, a monotonous battle of aggressive baseliners whose only time spent at the net is to shake hands, others feel the current crop comprise supremely gifted athletes, who display a discipline unrivalled in other generations. The women on today’s WTA tour produce groundstrokes that rebound from their rackets like rockets and possess serves that should probably come with permits they are so lethal. One of the main reasons for this increase in power is the shift to graphite rackets from the wooden frames that were used in the past. But technology hasn’t been the only factor behind the dramatic change in women’s tennis. Just as Bjorn Borg revolutionised the sport with topspin, there were also female players who reshaped the game with their own unique styles. Former British pro Sue Mappin, who reached career-high world rankings of No.28 in singles and No.6 in doubles, attributes the re-styling of tennis to the advent of the two-handed backhand and, in particular, the style of American former world No.1 Evert. “I think the reason she was so influential was because she was so good,” Mappin says. “There were other players with two-handed backhands, not that many, but she was successful and as soon as someone is successful with a certain way of playing you can guarantee coaches are going to be watching and saying, ‘Right, all my players will have two-handed backhands because she has done so well’. When Chris came on the scene she also hit the ball very early and I suppose that was the start of the penetrating groundstrokes.” Evert’s influence on today’s game is difficult to underestimate, with a staggering 92 per cent of women favouring a double-handed backhand on the tour this year. The 18-time Grand Slam champion paved the way for a generation of hard-hitting baseliners who were additionally facilitated by the introduction of carbon fibre rackets, nylon strings and bigger racket heads. Developments in cardiovascular, agility and strength training also impacted the women’s game, contributing to the finely-chiselled athletes that grace the court today. If Evert is to be credited with revolutionising the way tennis is played, then Navratilova and Steffi Graf have to be recognised as the pioneers for off-the-court conditioning that is now a vital component of professional sport. Barry Newcombe, a journalist who has covered the last 46 Wimbledon Championships, has witnessed first hand the transformation of tennis players into the robust athletes of today. “They all look a lot sharper to me now,” Newcombe says about modern players. “Not just those who are going to be in the second week of a Grand Slam, but those who are in the first week. Graf was a great athlete. She trained with the German track and field team at the 1984 Olympics and they reckon she was a 400-metre runner straight away and had the qualities to compete at Olympic level, which showed where her fitness level was.” But as players became more aggressive and stronger, and their equipment became more powerful, there was an inevitable period of inconsistency in the women’s game. Mappin explains that for a while there was almost an inverse relationship between power and variety, because as players started to hit the ball harder, the diversity in their play gradually began to fade. “There was a period when I used to watch the women hitting the cover off the ball but there was no strategy, just hitting balls as hard as possible,” she says. “There was an A plan, but there was no B plan and there certainly wasn’t a C plan. So if your hard hitting didn’t work on that particular day you weren’t successful, and you didn’t have an alternative. But now I think it is beginning to change. We are beginning to see players looking to do more.” Mappin’s view that variety is beginning to creep back into women’s tennis is echoed by Patrick Mouratoglou, a Frenchman who has coached top 20 players such as Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, Aravane Rezai and Marcos Baghdatis. “I don’t think that the players have become one-dimensional,” Mouratoglou argues. “Schiavone, Williams, Stosur, Azarenka, Wozniacki, Martinez-Sanchez, Vinci. Would you say that they all play the same? The women’s game has improved a lot in 30 years. It has grown in terms of interest, in terms of prizemoney, and many more young girls have had the desire to develop and become professional tennis players. There is much more competition than before.” Mourataglou also believes that one of the major differences in the women’s game has come on the serve and return. The Williams sisters knocked the tennis world off its axis when they arrived on the scene in the late 90s. They were the poster girls for the power era with missile-like serves and a return of serve position that saw them stand three feet inside the baseline. Everything about them – their height, physique, power and ability – was daunting for their opponents from the get-go. While the serve was once used as a means of starting the point, Venus and Serena were ending points with it and competitors started to take note. In 1989 only two women hit serves that were measured at over 100 mph, but 15 years later that number had risen to 151 players. Venus currently holds the record for the fastest serve of all time, clocked at 129mph, while Serena isn’t too far off with a 128mph bazooka of her own. Women’s tennis was once characterised by teen queens. Players who burst onto the scene before their sweet 16s with little fear of the established pros that stood on the opposite side of the net. But with only two teenagers currently inside the world’s top 100 –Bojana Jovanovski and Christina McHale – the average age of professional players is increasing. The ITF has put in place rules that limit the amount of professional tournaments that girls under 18 can play, but you also have to question if the excessive power in today’s game contributed to the decline in teenagers at the top. “If you’re only 17, 18, 19 you are still developing,” says Mappin. “If you look at Laura Robson, she has a great game to build on. The fact that she is left-handed is a huge plus, but she is vulnerable because she hasn’t got the strength yet because she is still growing.” So where does the game develop from here? Pint-sized champions such as Martina Hingis and Justine Henin broke the mould over the last few decades with a variety to their game that troubled the most powerful players. Their success gave belief that power can be combatted and the general consensus now is that the women, like the men, are starting to find ways to manage not only their opponent’s power, but their own too. Aggressive hitters on the tour today, including Serena, have seen the need to add more variety and they have duly obliged. “I think that power can be beaten, but Serena is simply the best player in the world at the moment,” said Mourataglou. “Young players are rising but they need one or two more years to develop.” We have seen skillful champions and we have seen powerful champions. If this is the generation that combines the two, then the women’s game has a very bright future indeed. ‘Girl power’ featured in the November 2011 issue of tennishead magazine.

All Rights Reserved.", "NEW YORK — A long season full of tennis history behind her, Serena Williams arrived at Tuesday night's Sports Illustrated Sportsperson of the Year award ceremony at Pier 60 flanked by those who have been by her side from the start — her family.

In Venus and Serena, the new documentary that hit select theaters recently, director and producer Michelle Major and her team dug into the lives of the Williams sisters during 2011. With unfettered access, the cameras caught the pair practicing with their parents, recovering from injuries with blood-filled IV bags and learning from John McEnroe when to curse out referees — and Serena smooching with then-boyfriend Common. But for all the behind-the-scenes access, including a moment in which their mother, Oracene Price, fusses after being questioned by a British reporter about why Serena grunts, many critics complained that the film doesn't reveal any new information for avid tennis fans. \"We've heard that, but we think it's incredibly revealing,\" Major told The Root. \"We went into this because there was so much mythology and so many negative stories around these two women who deserved to have their stories told truthfully, whatever it was. Also, their father, Richard Williams, is portrayed in the media as [a] sinister Svengali who's 'puppeteering' his daughters, and we wanted to get to the bottom of that.\" One of the biggest reveals is the sisters' relationship with their enigmatic father, coach and ultimate motivator. It is the challenge of his role in Venus' early career that creates tension in the film. Specifically, when tennis coach Rick Macci is interviewed, he says that Richard wrote and asked Macci to mentor his daughters. Eco-friendly Dog TreatsYour furry friends give you all the love every day, so it only makes sense that you want to give them the best in return: food that’s good for them and the planet. Macci says he did just that, even funding the family's move to Florida, where the siblings could practice around the clock, thanks to the weather, and putting Richard on his payroll. However, when Venus began her athletic ascent, Richard fired Macci. When asked in the film about her influential coaches, Venus never mentions him. \"I'm glad you saw that,\" Major said. \"We asked her over and over again about her coaches, and she'd say 'my sister' or 'my mother,' and finally she asked me, 'Who do you mean?' and that's when you hear me say, 'Rick Macci says he coached you quite a bit … ' I expected she'd bring him up, but her father is all that matters. \"She doesn't feel that Rick Macci should get any more credit than he already has,\" she continued. \"She and her father are so close, and she wanted to focus on how amazing he was, and she doesn't like anybody who tries to take that credit away.\" Throwing a wrench in their father-daughter relationship is the matter of unidentified half-siblings. Before Richard and Oracene married, Richard had another relationship that produced five children, a fact that Venus and Serena know. He has other children, too, however. One possible older brother awkwardly appears on the court next to Richard during one scene, and in the next, Serena says she has no idea who the man is. \"Richard Williams is a total enigma. I was talking to Richard, and the other gentleman was introduced as his son,\" Major said. \"I innocently asked Serena who he was, and that's when she gave me that answer. I didn't know if she was joking — because she has a wicked sense of humor — until I asked others in the family and they said, 'No, that's true [she doesn't know him].' I think that was how they were shielded in their family, to not even have to experience the older siblings.\" One reality the pair weren't sheltered from is the racist underbelly of tennis and the game's seemingly fickle fans. During the infamous Indian Wells Masters tournament, the Williams family, and Serena specifically, were booed and called \"nigger\" by fans. In response, Richard raised a black power fist toward the crowd. Serena won, but the sisters never returned to that tournament. Serena likened their decision to the anti-racism protests of Martin Luther King Jr., saying that she had to stand up for herself. \"Through filming, we learned how they deal with criticism through their incredible drive, especially with Serena,\" Major says. \"She can have things broken and still win because of her mental toughness. We didn't really understand that the only reason Serena plays tennis is because her big sister did. It's crazy.\" Ultimately, Venus and Serena is an interesting look at two African-American athletes building upon the legacy of Arthur Ashe and Althea Gibson. From the early footage of the sisters practicing on the courts of Compton, Calif., to winning doubles at Wimbledon, theirs is a bond built to defend each other and make both of them great.

She has won 66 singles championships, 22 doubles championships, and was also Gold-Medalist at the 2000 (doubles), 2008 (doubles), and 2012 (singles and doubles) Olympics.

The Serena Williams Fund focuses on creating equal access to education and assisting victims of senseless community violence. To that end, The Serena Williams Fund partners with organizations and leaders doing great work to positively impact communities and the lives of other human beings both nationally and globally.

Indeed, when he joined Die Roten in summer 2008, the former Hamburg favourite had made just 20 league appearances over the two preceding campaigns with Chelsea and Sevilla. Called up by Marco van Basten for the 2006 FIFA World Cup™, the player introduced to the game by Martin Jol at Waalwijk disputed all four of his country’s encounters in Germany. Noted for his strong tackling, he went into that tournament having earned the nickname “Khalid the Cannibal” among Hamburg fans, excelling alongside the likes of Daniel Van Buyten in the Bundesliga’s tightest defence in 2005/06. Happy to perform the guard-dog role at the back, he nonetheless picked up his fair share of cards along the way. In the wake of Germany 2006, Boulahrouz joined Chelsea, where after a promising start he was soon left hungry for more playing time. A loan move to Sevilla followed in summer 2007, but the stopper failed to adapt to life in La Liga and remained in the shadows. Relief came with his transfer to Stuttgart and he impressed in his debut season, but the death of his child during UEFA EURO 2008 changed his relationship with the game. He appeared in just one qualifier on the road to South Africa.

His predecessors did not fare so well. By the time United finished their 1950 summer tour of the United States, it seemed that the flight of British players to Bogota had come to an end. It had begun, sensationally, with the clandestine defection of two Stoke City players, Neil Franklin and George Mountford, seduced by the Santa Fe club with an offer of £50 a week - several times the then maximum wage in English football. It was both a shock and a scandal, above all because Franklin, then the elegant England centre-half expected to play in the imminent World Cup finals in Brazil, had not only ruled himself out of the side but had lied to the Football Association, telling them his reason for withdrawal was because his wife was going to have a baby. But neither he nor Mountford, an outside-right, found it easy to settle; nor, indeed, did the other British players who followed them. All returned with their careers in ruins. Franklin never played for Stoke or England again, sliding down the league to Hull City. Then, suddenly, and unexpectedly, off went Charlie Mitten to south America. The move was possible because, at that time, the Colombians were not members of football's international governing body, Fifa. They had thus been able to attract some of the main Argentine talents, notably to the Millonarios club; Santa Fe turned, for a time, to English players. In the event, Mitten played long enough in Colombia to make plenty of money, after which he calmly came home. There would be no place for him with Manchester United, his local club - and one with which he had been since his teenage years, though he had actually been born in Rangoon. However, after serving a none too onerous suspension, he joined Fulham, with whom, though somewhat heavier than in the past, he played for several impressive seasons. His pace might have been diminished, but his renowned balance, cool ball control and notable left foot - adept alike for crosses, shots or penalty kicks - were fully functional. The second world war cut important years out of Mitten's career, though once it was over he established himself as a salient member of the United attack so successfully deployed by Matt Busby, who had just taken over a team without a stadium, Old Trafford having been badly bombed during the war. The forward line was composed of Jim Delaney, the supposedly brittle-boned Scottish international, Johnny Morris, a quick little inside-right, Jack Rowley, a forceful centre-forward, Stan Pearson, and Mitten himself. Of these, Mitten, Morris and Pearson were all developed by United. Altogether, Mitten played 161 games and scored 61 goals in his four league championship seasons with United. During those years, the club did not win the championship itself, but were impressive winners of the FA Cup in 1948, beating Blackpool 4-2 in the final at Wembley, after initially falling behind. Perhaps the most famous match they played in that tournament was against Aston Villa, in Birmingham in the third round. Aston Villa scored straight from the kick-off, but by half-time United were 5-1 ahead. With nine minutes left, Villa had pulled it back to 5-4, but a fine move between Rowley, Delaney and Mitten ended with Jones, in Villa's goal, turning Mitten's drive over the bar, and Stan Pearson scoring from the corner. By the time he left United, Mitten had played for England just once, in an unofficial charity international against Scotland at Maine Road, Manchester, in August 1946. He was never given a full cap; there was intense competition for his role. In his first season for Fulham in 1951-52, having been amnestied after the south American adventure, he made 16 appearances, scoring half a dozen goals, but could not save his new club from relegation to the second division. The following season, he played 40 times for another six goals, forming a notable left-wing pair with the precocious young inside-left, Johnny Haynes. Nine goals in 41 games came in season 1953-54, six goals in 36 games in 1954-55, and just four goals in 21 games in 1955-56, with promotion still elusive. In 1956, Mitten became manager of Mansfield Town, and did well enough to land a plum post in 1958 at Newcastle United, bringing on Ivor Allchurch, Len White and George Eastham, before he was sacked when the club was relegated in 1961. He then became player-manager of non-league Altrincham. As his trip to Colombia might have suggested, Mitten was always a betting man; indeed, it was rumoured that he dealt in horses while in south America. Back in England, greyhounds were more his style, and he took charge of Manchester's White City greyhound stadium in the 1960s, later running a sports promotion business in the city. He was married, with two sons and a daughter. · Charles Mitten, footballer and manager, born January 17 1921; died January 2 2002 SoccerCharlie MittenManchester United star who made it big in BogotaBrian GlanvilleWed 9 Jan 2002 18.53 ESTCharlie Mitten, who has died aged 80, was the Manchester United winger in Matt Busby's first great side after the second world war who decamped to Colombia and prospered.

A Salford boy, born on 11 January 1919, he was spotted playing for Adelphi Lads’ Club by United’s legendary scout Louis Rocca and signed as an amateur in December 1935. In May 1937 he turned professional and just six months later made the step up to first- team football. However, just as Pearson was establishing himself in the first team, his career was interrupted by the outbreak of war. During the six years organized football was suspended, he served with the 2nd/4th Lancashires and also managed to make guest appearances for Newcastle United, Brighton and Hove Albion and Queens Park Rangers. Resuming his duties with United in 1946 – and with Matt Busby newly installed as manager –Pearson took up the inside-forward role, becoming one of the best of the day at a time when England had a wealth talent to choose from. He was a key member of Busby’s first great United team that tasted first success the F.A. Cup in 1948 (Pearson scored a hat-trick in the semi-final against Derby County and one in the 4-2 final win over Blackpool) and won the League Championship in 1952. Ever-reliable, Pearson missed only 13 first-team matches in seven seasons between 1946 and 1953, and proved the perfect foil for Jack Rowley. Apart from consistency Pearson possessed a deadly and accurate shot. After losing his place to the young Jackie Blanchflower in the 1953/54 season, he moved to Bury in February 1954 for £4,500, after which became player-manager at Chester where he continued to play until the age of 40.

Although Walter Crickmer never assumed the title of Manager of Manchester United, he twice dovetailed the duties of team selection with those of his post as club Secretary. One of the finest administrators in United’s history, Crickmer first took charge of the team, along with Louis Rocca, in 1931-32, between the reigns of Herbert Bamlett and Scott Duncan. After Duncan resigned in November 1937, United were without a Manager until the appointment of Matt Busby in 1945. Once again, Crickmer helped out with the playing affairs, and his job took him through the troubled years of 1939-45. It was Crickmer who, in 1938, was largely responsible for instituting the famous United youth policy that served the club so well in subsequent years. He was appointed Secretary in 1926, and lost his life in the Munich air disaster, after 38 years with United. A.Scott Duncan, 1932-1937. Former Dumbarton, Glasgow Rangers and Newcastle United player Scott Duncan was offered the post of United Manager in August 1932, at a salary reported to be £800 per annum. In his first two seasons he spent a great deal of money, buying several players from his native Scotland, and he came under fire from newspapers and supporters for failing to produce good results, despite his financial outlay. Duncan had played once for United during World War One. His signings as Manager included Scottish internationals Neil Dewar from Third Lanark and Chambers from Cowdenbeath, together with Shamrock Rovers’ Irish international, Byrne, and Welsh international Bamford from Wrexham. He saw United narrowly escape relegation in 1933-34, but two years later steered them to the Second Division Championship. The success was followed by the offer of a five-year contract for the Manager, but United were not equipped for life in Division One, and a year later they were down again. After the first 14 games of 1938-39, Duncan resigned and became Manager of Ipswich Town, who were then in the Southern League. He took them into the Football League, whilst United’s first game after his departure, a 7-1 win at Chesterfield, began a run which secured the promotion once more, despite having no ‘proper’ Manager for the rest of the season. Apart from the Second Division Championship, Duncan, who also managed Hamilton and Cowdenbeath, made little impact at Old Trafford. Sir Matt Busby, 1945-69 and 1970-71. When the Manchester United directors appointed Matt Busby Manager in 1045, they made probably the most significant decision in the club’s history. Like Ernest Mangnall before him, Busby brought glory to the club….and in Busby’s case it was to find a stage wider than anyone could have imagined in Mangnall’s days before World War One. Busby, the son of a Scottish miner, was a stylish half-back with Manchester City and Liverpool before World War Two, and although he won only one full cap for Scotland, he skippered his country in several wartime internationals. Busby inherited a club with no home, for Old Trafford had been severely damaged in the war. His team played their home matches at Maine Road as he began to rebuild from the ashes. Busby moulded together his first great team under Captain Johnny Carey. They went on to win the FA Cup in 1948, in a Final of breathtaking skill and excitement, and with the addition of talented youth, lifted the Championship in 1952; the clubs first League title in 41 years. In their first six seasons under Busby, United never finished lower than fourth. At his side was Jimmy Murphy, and they formed a partnership which could spot raw talent and then nurture it to greatness. Roger Byrne, Tommy Taylor, Duncan Edwards and Bobby Charlton were just some of the players who stand testament to their joint skills. Busby took United to consecutive League titles, in 1956 and 1957, and in the second of those years he came close to winning for the Reds the first modern ‘double’ of League and Cup. By then, his quest for the European Cup had started and by now United were one of the best club sides in the world. The European dream was shattered at Munich, where Busby suffered injuries so severe that he was administered the Last Rites. He also had to suffer the cruel knowledge that he had lost many of his young players. Busby was absent from his desk for six months. With Jimmy Murphy, he began to assemble a new United. Law, Herd, Crerand,Cantwell and others were drafted in and United won the FA Cup again in 1963, narrowly missing relegation the same season, and the League Championship in 1965. A Championship two years later set the stage for another attempt at the European Cup, and this time Busby’s dream was realised. United lifted the trophy with a magnificent win over Benfica at Wembley, and he and Bobby Charlton shed tears of joy together. The players had sensed it was Busby’s last chance to win the major European club honour. He made way for Wilf McGuinness, but retained the post of General Manager. When McGuinness was relieved of his job in December 1970, Busby took charge once more, steering United away from trouble. He left the Manager’s chair in 1971, a quarter of a century after he was first appointed. Sir Matt Busby, he was knighted in the wake of United’s European triumph, maintained close links with the club and the city. He was made a Freeman of Manchester in 1968, appointed a United director and then the club’s President. In 1945, he was offered jobs as a Coach at Liverpool, assistant-Manager of Reading, and Manager of Ayr United. He turned them all down for a £15 per week job as Manager of Manchester United. Four years later, Spurs offered him £50 a week to become their Manager. Every United fan, young or old, can be eternally thankful that he turned them down. Jimmy Murphy, February-August 1958. Welsh international wing-half Jimmy Murphy was with West Brom from 1928 to the outbreak of war. He served in Italy, where he met Matt Busby, and when Busby was offered the United Manager’s job in 1945, Murphy was his first ‘signing’. He was initially employed as Coach and, always Busby’s right-hand man, he was officially appointed assistant-Manager in 1955. Shortly afterwards he became the Wales team Manager, and around this time was offered lucrative jobs in Brazil and with Italian giants, Juventus. A talented Coach, Murphy guided the development of many fine players, but he regarded Duncan Edwards as the finest footballer he ever saw. When the United party flew to Belgrade in 1958, Murphy missed the trip because he was on International duty with the Welsh team for a World Cup qualifier at Cardiff. In the wake of the Munich tragedy, he took charge of United and led them to the 1958 FA Cup Final. In August that year, Murphy made way for the return of Busby. He had been a monumental tower of strength in the months following the disaster. An avid reader and pianist in the classical mould, Murphy resigned as assistant Manager in 1971, although he continued to scout for the club he has served for over 25 years. He died on 14 November 1989. Wilf McGuinness, 1969-70. When United appointed Wilf McGuinness as successor to Sir Matt Busby in 1969, no one doubted the enormity of his task. Although he had already served the club for almost 17 years, he faced a daunting situation as replacement for one of the game’s greatest Managers, in one of the most prestigious managerial seats in the business. His playing career ended through injury when he was only 22, and he joined United’s training staff. McGuinness was involved in the preparation of several England teams, including the 1966 World Cup squad, and on 9 April 1969 it was announced he was being appointed United’s chief Coach in readiness for Busby’s retirement at the end of the season. On 1 June 1969 he was given the Manager’s job; in December 1970, he lost the position and reverted to trainer-coach of the reserve team. The concept of promoting from within had not worked for United and McGuinness had probably found it difficult to manage players who were established Internationals, and who had achieved so much more than him as a player. McGuinness had achieved minor success as United’s Manager, two League Cup semi-finals and one FA Cup semi- final, bur he could not provide the League and European glory that the club so desperately needed. He later managed the Greek club, Aris Salonika, and then York City. In 1986, McGuinness was on the coaching staff at Bury and much sought after for his wit as an after-dinner speaker. He spoke at the 1986 PFA Annual Awards dinner. [1] [2] [3] This site is in no way connected with Manchester United Football Club PLC.

Part of the attraction for fans around the world has been the football luminaries, such as George Best and Sir Bobby Charlton, who have graced the Old Trafford turf in a Manchester United shirt over the years. Recently, Manchester United have continued to attract or develop some of the game’s biggest names, with England stalwarts such as Paul Scholes and David Beckham having been regular fixtures in the Reds line-up. The Manchester United team, past and present, reads like a who’s who of world football. It is only fitting that a great team should grace a great stadium. And with Old Trafford’s recent development it is easily the largest in English club football, holding in excess of 75,000 fans. Despite this capacity, the demand to see United in action is so great that tickets are hard to come by. But it isn’t only Manchester United fans who flock to Old Trafford. The standard of the ground is such that it regularly hosts high-profile games, most notably, the Champions League Final and Great Britain rugby league games. Rock fans have also made use of the Reds’ facilities, watching a number of high-profile acts at the ground. But it’s football that will forever be synonymous with the Reds famous ground - and with good reason. Manchester United has won the league no fewer than 15 times in their history - eight times since the advent of the Premiership. They are also Cup Kings too, winning the FA cup 10 times, the league cup twice, as well as winning the European super cup, European cup winner’s cup, and twice being crowned European Cup champions. Manchester United has long become a name associated with success both on and off the pitch.

Last updated on 7 Mar 2014. Learn about the life of the martial arts legend who has influenced millions of martial artists around the world including many famous martial artists like the late Bruce Lee. This article covers mostly the historical and biographical accounts of Ip Man's life. Please note, this article is similar to the one on Wikipedia because that was heavily edited by myself as well. Ip Man is sometimes referred to as Yip Man. He was born on the first of October 1893-10-01 and died on the second of December 1972-12-02. He was born to Ip (Yip) Oi Dor and Ng Shui, and was the third of four children. He grew up in a very wealthy family in Foshan, Guangdong province in China, and received an exceptionally high standard of education. His older brother was Ip Kai Gak. His older sister was Ip Wan Mei and his younger sister was Ip Wan Hum. Ip is the family name which is said first in Chinese culture. Ip Kai Man was one of the first martial arts instructors, or Sifu, to teach the Chinese martial art of Wing Chun Kung Fu publicly1. He had several students who later became martial arts teachers in their own right, including Bruce Lee. When Ip Man was thirteen years old he started learning Wing Chun from Chan Wah-shun. Because of his sifu's old age, Ip Man had to learn much of his skills and techniques from his master's second eldest disciple Ng Chung-sok. Three years into Ip Man's training Chan Wah-shun died. One of his dying wishes was to have Ng continue training Ip. At the age of 15 Ip man moved to Hong Kong with help from Leung Fut Ting, a relative. At age sixteen, Ip Man attended school at St. Stephen's College in Hong Kong. It was a secondary school for wealthy families and foreigners who lived in Hong Kong. According to Ip Man's two sons (Ip Ching and Ip Chun), while at St. Stephen's Ip Man intervened after seeing a foreign police officer beating a woman. The story goes that the police officer tried to strike Ip Man who used his martial arts to strike the officer down, at which point Ip Man and his classmate ran to school. The classmate is said to have told an older man who lived in the same apartment block. Ip Man was invited to see this man and the man asked Ip Man what martial art he studied. Ip told him, but said he would not understand. The man then asked Ip Man to show him his first 2 forms (Sil Lim Tao and Chun Kiu). The man then told Ip Man that his forms were \"not too great.\" Ip Man was then invited to Chi Sau (a form of training that involves controlled attack and defence). Ip Man saw this as an opportunity to prove his Kung Fu was good, but he was beaten after just a few strikes. It turned out that the old man was his master's elder fellow-disciple (and so, by Chinese tradition Ip Man's martial uncle or Sibak), Leung Bik , son of his master's master Leung Jan. After that ncounter, Ip Man continued his training lessons from Leung Bik. Ip Man recounts the story himself in an interview with Martial Hero Magazine, although in his own account he does not mention a fight with a police officer and claims it was because he was always causing trouble at school that his friends spoke to Leung Bik about him. By the age of 24, Ip Man had returned to Foshan, his Wing Chun skills tremendously improved. In Foshan, Ip Man became a policeman. He did not formally run a Wing Chun school, but taught several of his subordinates, his friends and relatives. Kwok Fu and Lun Kai (2 of Ip Man's students and friends) went on to teach students of their own. The art of Wing Chun in the Foshan and Guangdong area was mainly passed down from these two individuals. Ip Man went to Kwok Fu's village house during the Japanese Occupation. He only returned to Foshan after the war, to once again take up the job of a police officer. While in Foushan Ip Man met Yuen Kay Shan and they became friends despite being from different lineages of Wing Chun. Ip Man and Yuen Kay Shan became close enough with that he taught Ip Man let Yeun Kay Shan teach his son, Ip Chun, the first form of the art[2]. At the end of 1949, the Chinese Communist party won the Chinese civil war. Ip Man being an officer of the opposing Kuomintang political party, decided to escape to Hong Kong without his family when the Communists came to Foshan. In Hong Kong, Ip Man opened a Wing Chun martial arts school. Initially, business was poor because his students typically stayed for only a couple of months. He moved his school twice, to Hoi Tan Street in Sham Shui Po, and then to Lee Tat Street in Yau Ma Tei. By then, some of his students were skilled enough that they were able to start their own schools. Some of Ip Man's students and descendants compared their skills with other martial artists in combat. Initially many were defeated, but later, before Ip Man's death their victories over other martial artists helped to bolster Ip Man's reputation as a teacher. In 1967, Ip Man and some of his students established the Hong Kong Ving Tsun Athletic Association. In 1972, Ip Man suffered cancer and subsequently died on the 2nd of December that same year. About 6 weeks before he died he asked his 2 sons and his student Lau Hon Lam to film him performing the Wing Chun system as practice by him. He only managed Sil Lim Tau, Chum Kiu and the Dummy form. This is because he was in a lot of pain and was weak and unsteady on his feet. He was going to do Biu Gee, the Knife form and long pole. However Grandmaster Ip Chun and Ip Ching and Sifu Lau Hong Lam stopped Ip Man because Biu Gee, the knives and full pole form require a lot of energy to perform. Ip Man had many students and worried some of them were adapting the system due to their own incomplete knowledge and felt that filming it was the only way to stop the frauds and cheats. Ip Man shows Wing Chun's Chum Kiu form as filmed in 1972 Within the three decades of his career in Hong Kong, he established a training system for Wing Chun that eventually spread across the world. This article is an account Ip Man gave about the general history of Wing Chun. Whilst not considered factually accurate, it does highlight how Ip Man viewed Wing Chun. The Wing Chun Kuen Kuit represent part of the legacy Ip Man left behind. The Kuen Kuit or fighting sayings (literally fist poem) highlight some key aspects of Wing Chun.

Ip Man taught openly but (in the 1950's at least) he did have rules around who he taught. He would not teach the following 4 types of people according to Andrew Hang Lum Ma: 2.

His professional career with the Shrews began in the 2003/04 season, when he played a handful of games, before becoming first choice keeper in the 2005/06 campaign. He was England under 19 ’keeper when he joined the Blues and made his first team debut on October 14, 2006, against Sheffield United and he kept a clean sheet in a goalless draw. Joe was loaned out to Tranmere at the start of January 2007 and was almost immediately selected for England's Under 21s. He made a second half appearance against Spain in a 2-2 draw. Further experience was gained on loan at Blackpool and when he came back to City he eventually beat off the challenge of Sweden number one Andreas Isaksson and Kasper Schmeichel to become Sven-Goran Eriksson’s first choice. He won his first England cap in June 2008 against Trinidad and Tobago but having started that season as number one was replaced by Shay Given in January. Having topped 50 first team appearances, Hart spent the summer of 2009 playing for England’s Under 21s in the European Championships in Sweden. The dramatic penalty shoot-out in the semi final saw Joe save a couple, and score one - but a yellow card, his second of the tournament, meant that he had to sit out the final. Around this time his season-long loan to promoted Birmingham City was also confirmed. A resounding success at St Andrews, he was named in the PFA Team of the Year and included in Fabio Capello's England squad for the World Cup. He did not play during that ill-fated campaign, but he impressed Roberto Mancini enough in pre-season to get the nod as City's first-choice goalkeeper for the start of 2010/11. From the first match of that season when Joe was awarded man of the match in the 0-0 draw with Tottenham, he hasn't looked back and has cemented his reputation as one of the most assured goalkeepers in Europe, becoming England's undisputed no.1 and earning the Golden Gloves award for the Premier League in City's title-winning 2011/12 campaign. Joe is one of the elder statesmen in the City ranks now after his six years at the club and his slow motion reaction to Sergio Aguero's last minute winner against QPR on the final day has become one of the website's most popular videos and showed just how much the club's recent success means to him. One of England's top performers in last summer's Euro 2012, Hart then went on to claim his third-successive Golden Gloves award in 2012/13 - proving he still has the safest hands in the Premier League. Joe looks at his greatest YouTube videos. During the Pre Season/Summer Tour of the US and Canada, some of the players and staff on their afternoon off chose to visit 'Dodger Stadium' home of Major League Baseball Team 'LA Dodgers'. Before the game, Joe was privileged enough to throw the first pitch and purchased some merchandise which he personalised. Take a bow Mr Joe Hart. A spectacular goal from the England number one.

His debut for Manchester United at Manchester City last weekend was watched by tens of millions of viewers worldwide, among them his 23 brothers and sisters. He lasted only 45 minutes before being substituted, with his team 2-0 behind. 'It's never nice as a defender when you concede goals,' the left-back said after United's 3-1 defeat, 'and I can't be happy with my debut. But I'll quickly put that behind me. Now we've just got to knuckle down.' His knuckling down could start in another high-profile Premiership game against Liverpool at Old Trafford this afternoon, and continue in the League Cup when United take a 1-1 away draw into the second leg of the semi-final against Blackburn on Wednesday. Evra already has a scar to show for his efforts. Tangling with Trevor Sinclair midway through the first half of the derby, he was caught first by a flailing arm and then, as he lost balance and fell, by the City winger's studs. The unintentional collision left Evra with a cut along the left eyebrow and a squint that made it seem as though he was winking when we met in the tunnel after the game. 'I expected it to be a physical game, but that's never bothered me,' he said. 'I can give as good as I get. My vision was blurred for a few minutes, but I'm not sure whether I was taken off for that or whether it was a tactical change.' The latter is favourite. Evra is desperate to impress at United, hoping that a run of good performances will earn him a place in France's World Cup squad. When Bixente Lizarazu quit international football following France's Euro 2004 flop, Evra seemed to be the ideal replacement. Similar in playing style and attitude, he had just completed a fine season with Monaco, including an appearance in the Champions League final. But, while his five caps have all come since Raymond Domenech replaced Jacques Santini, recently the coach has been aping Jose Mourinho by playing William Gallas out of position at left-back, with Jean-Alain Boumsong partnering Lilian Thuram in the middle. When Lyon left-back Eric Abidal returns from injury, Gallas is expected to shift inside to partner Thuram. Evra will compete with Abidal for the left-back spot. 'It's a World Cup year and you can't help but think about it,' Evra says. 'It will all depend on how well I play, but maybe as the left-back of Manchester United I have a better chance of convincing the coach.' As long as there are no repeats of the derby performance, of course. Evra's journey to Old Trafford has been a circuitous and, it is fair to say, remarkable one. Evra has many people to thank for helping to guide him along a tortuous path from the tough Paris suburb where he grew up. There have been so many turning points, fateful moments, on the way that he barely knows where to begin. Those he is grateful to include his huge family, the Italian scout he met in a suburban gym, a Senegalese stranger who saved him from sleeping rough in Milan, a group of nuns on a packed train, and Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink for a tackle that left Evra with a nasty scar across the inside of his left ankle but a new fan in Sir Alex Ferguson. Evra, 24, was born in Senegal's capital, Dakar, the youngest of eight children. His father, who married four times and added another 16 kids to the clan, worked for the Senegalese Embassy and was sent to work in Brussels before the family settled in France. Evra, who recently became a father himself - his son, Lenny, is now three months old - was still a toddler when he moved to the high-rise concrete blocks that form Les Ulis, the same suburb to the south of Paris where Thierry Henry first began kicking a football. Henry's talent was spotted early. Evra, though, was still clicking his heels at 17 and getting into bother with the local gendarmes for petty crimes bred of boredom - scrapping, and stealing croissants from the boulangerie. Evra was invited by a friend from another Paris suburb to play in a small five-a-side tournament in Juvisy. It was to be his first step towards the big time. An impressed Italian observer approached Evra and asked if he fancied a trial with Torino. Evra accepted, and after the trial he was whisked off not to sign for Torino but by Marsala, a Sicilian team then playing in the third division. A contract was offered and accepted. Evra, then a dashing forward, was a professional footballer. Next was a pre-season training camp in a remote town in the north Italian countryside. The scout wrote down the train route from Paris on a scrap of paper, and provided the tickets. Evra nearly never made it. 'I hadn't exactly done a lot of international travelling, shall we say,' Evra says. 'I made it to Milan, but then couldn't work out where my connection was.' Not speaking a word of Italian, a distressed Evra tried and failed to communicate with railway staff and passersby. In a panic, he rang his mother and said he wanted to give up and go back home. She told him to sort it out and after wandering around aimlessly for a while, the near penniless Evra slumped to the floor in tears and prepared himself for a night under the stars in front of the station. He would try to find the right train the next day. In stepped the stranger from Senegal. 'He saw my distress and just came and saved me,' says Evra. 'He was so kind, and being from my homeland made it a bit special to me, sort of fated. He put me up for the night and put me on the right train the next day. There were five of us on this huge mattress in his tiny pad. I'd love to see that guy again, to say thanks.' On the train, as the temperature became stifling, Evra was seized by another panic attack: would he know when to get off? Many of the little stations did not have proper signs, his worries grew and he began to badger a group of nuns who could not understand a word of French but seemed to recognise the name of the town Evra was seeking. He asked them every five minutes just in case. 'When we finally arrived, they almost pushed me off the train,' Evra says, laughing. 'They were so glad to see the back of me.' Evra, excited at being handed his first proper set of kit, settled quickly with Marsala. Playing up front, he scored six times in 27 games and was popular with the locals who dubbed him the Black Gazelle. He has fond memories of his time in Sicily, less so of the following season. After proposed moves to Lazio and Roma collapsed amid a heap of scrabbling agents, Evra found himself with second-division Monza and a coach who was not interested in the teenager. The only good things that happened in the following months, says Evra, is that he got to finally know his way around nearby Milan station and his brother Dominique met his future wife. They now run a bar in Milan. Frustrated at his lack of games, Evra engineered a move back to France with Nice in the second division. After starting out in attack for the first few matches, Evra was forced to fill in at left-back for the last 15 minutes of a game against Laval following a spate of injuries. He did so well that his coach, Sandro Salvioni, decided to prolong the experiment, much to Evra's displeasure. Despite a running row between the two that lasted the remainder of the season, Evra shone sufficiently in his new position to be named the division's best left-back. Didier Deschamps, just starting out on his managerial career, persuaded Evra to turn his back on interest from Barcelona and Auxerre and join him at Monaco. Which is where Hasselbaink comes in. Having memorably seen off Real Madrid, Monaco came up against Chelsea in the 2004 Champions League semi-final. In the opening minutes of the return leg at Stamford Bridge, Evra went down under a crunching challenge from the Dutch striker. There was a hole in his sock and he could see a gaping wound. Monaco's trainer signalled to the bench to make a substitution, before being convinced to backtrack. 'I told him I'd smash his face in if he made me go off,' says Evra, who even now is surprised at the vehemence of his words. 'I knew it was a bit mad, but I just had to play, even though my foot felt like it was hanging off. I apologised afterwards to our trainer for being so rude.' Evra later had nine stitches inserted and wears the scar proudly. Ferguson mentioned the incident to him when he first approached Evra, after Monaco lost the final 3-0 to Jose Mourinho's Porto. 'He said it showed my character, and he liked my determination,' Evra says. But Monaco, who had already allowed Ludovic Giuly and Jerome Rothen to leave, blocked United's move for their rising star. Ferguson, with some success, turned to his left-back Gabriel Heinze. When the popular Argentine was injured, Ferguson went back to Monaco and got his man. 'I know Heinze well and he's a good guy,' says Evra. 'It's funny how our destinies have crossed. But, you know, I've had so many twists and turns along the way that nothing really surprises me any more.'

While quite a boy Wood earned distinction as a cricketer, playing for Dartford School when only eleven years of age, and afterwards figuring with success in many local matches. It was as a member of the Kent eleven that he was introduced to public cricket, representing his native county against Hampshire at Southampton in June, 1876. In a somewhat intermittent fashion he kept up his connection with Kent cricket, appearing in 1878, and twice in 1881, but being absent from all the county's engagements in 1879 and 1880. In the winter of 1881 he accepted an appointment to take charge of the Streatham Club ground, and it was this engagement that enabled him to qualify by residence for Surrey. He made his first appearance for his adopted county in 1884, since which time he has been a regular member of the eleven, rendering brilliant service to the county both behind the wicket and with the bat. When he first gained a place in the team he was certainly not a high-class wicket-keeper, but constant practice in the best company did great things for him, and during the last two or three years he has been quite in the front rank. The crowning point of his career was reached in the season of 1888, when the Surrey Committee selected him to keep wicket for England against Australia at the Oval. With Pilling and Sherwin both available, the action of the Surrey Committee was to some extent experimental, but Wood certainly proved himself fully equal to his position. His one drawback is the fact that his hands are somewhat easily knocked up. At least, if this be not the case, he is peculiarly unlucky in having his fingers injured. In the winter of 1888-9 he was a member of the English team that toured in South Africa, and the trip had somewhat unfortunate results for him, the glare of the sun at the Cape affecting his eyesight so much that he went through the English season of 1889 under obvious disadvantages.

Died at Waddon, Surrey, 30th April 1919. Educated at Dartford School, where he learnt his cricket. He first went out as a professional in 1877 at Stanislaus College, Tullamore, Ireland, and the following year he was at the Private Banks Club, at Catford Bridge, and in 1880-81 at Dover. During this time he played nine matches for Kent. In 1881 he was engaged by W.S. Trollope to take charge during the winter months of the Streatham Cricket Ground, in Surrey and in 1882 and 1883 he was at Streatham. His first match for Surrey was in 1884 and he was engaged at The Oval from then until 1900, playing 286 times for Surrey and in 316 first-class matches in all. He toured South Africa in 1888/9 and 1891/2, playing in four Test Matches. He was a useful wicket-keeper and his only century was in a Test Match at Cape Town. Scores & Biographies in 1895 reported that his eyesight was failing so it is not perhaps so surprising that he became a first-class umpire 1910-12! 1878-81 he was working at Penns Engineering Works, Greenwich. He died after a lengthy illness. At the time of the 1881 Census, he was unmarried, aged 27, a cricketer, boarding at 29 Morden Street, Greenwich, Kent, the home of William Goddard, aged 59 and engineers labourer, and his wife Sarah, aged 48. Their son William T. is aged 18 a carpenter and John aged 14 a gas fitter. They also have Ann E. a daughter aged 9.

Johnny Weissmuller, byname of Peter John Weissmuller, original name Jonas Weissmuller, (born June 2, 1904, Freidorf, near Timişoara, Romania—died January 20, 1984, Acapulco, Mexico), American freestyle swimmer of the 1920s who won five Olympic gold medals and set 67 world records. He became even more famous as a motion-picture actor, most notably in the role of Tarzan, a “noble savage” who had been abandoned as an infant in a jungle and reared by apes. Weissmuller, whose parents immigrated to the United States when he was three, attended school only through the eighth grade but was trained in swimming at the Illinois Athletic Club in Chicago. He was a member of several championship relay and water-polo teams that represented the club during the 1920s. In individual freestyle swimming he was U.S. outdoor champion at 100 yards (1922–23, 1925 [no competition 1924]), 100 metres (1926–28), 200 metres (1921–22), 400 metres (1922–23, 1925–28 [no competition 1924]), and 800 metres (1925–27); and he was U.S. indoor titleholder at 100 yards (1922–25, 1927–28) and 220 yards (1922–24, 1927–28). At the 1924 Olympic Games he won three gold medals, for the 100-metre and 400-metre freestyle and the 4 × 200-metre relay (he also won a bronze medal as a member of the U.S. water-polo team); in 1928 he won two more gold medals, for the 100-metre freestyle and 4 × 200-metre relay. Despite his athletic records, Weissmuller is best known for his motion-picture role as Tarzan of the Apes, a character created by Edgar Rice Burroughs. Weissmuller starred in 12 Tarzan films between 1932 and 1948, beginning with Tarzan the Ape Man (1932). He later created the role of Jungle Jim, a guide, for both television and motion pictures.

But while Hillary and the expedition's leader Lord Hunt both believed the Sherpa had been born in a remote mountain village in Nepal, a new book by American mountaineer Ed Webster claims that not only was Tenzing born in Tibet, but he spent much of his childhood there. The world's most famous Sherpa was not really a Sherpa at all. Even after Tenzing's death in 1986, the truth was considered too sensitive to disclose, not least for fear of embarrassing the Indian government which had supported Tenzing after his ascent. It would have handed a propaganda coup to the Chinese authorities in the Tibetan capital Lhasa that a 'Chinese climber' was the first to climb Everest. But now Webster has been given permission by the family to reveal the truth about Tenzing's real origins. Throughout his life, Tenzing remained vague about his background. In his autobiography, Tiger of the Snows, he obscured the truth of his childhood without quite denying it, telling ghostwriter James Ramsey Ullman he grew up in the village of Thame, in Nepal. In fact, his parents migrated there during the early 1920s after a period of financial hardship and debt to a local Tibetan governor. Tenzing, however, was more forthcoming about his birthplace, saying: 'I was born in a place called Tsa-chu, near the great mountain of Makalu, and only a day's march from Everest.' Tenzing also explains that when he was born, his mother had been on a pilgrimage to the nearby monastery at Ghang La, the name of Tenzing's house in Darjeeling. When Tenzing climbed Everest in 1953 he was hailed by the Nepali government in Kathmandu as a local hero who happened to live in India. Nepal's fledgling constitutional monarchy feared political domination by the new Indian republic and both countries saw great propaganda value in claiming Tenzing, the first humble-born Asian of the modern era to achieve global fame, as their own. Tenzing's caution about revealing his true origins was partly explained by this political wrangling. 'After we climbed Everest,' Hillary said, 'and Tenzing was invited to England, we were really in a jam because Tenzing had no passport.' The crisis was averted only when the Indian Prime Minister Pandit Nehru stepped in and personally ensured Tenzing received an Indian passport - something for which the Nepalese authorities never forgave him. Nehru became Tenzing's patron and authorised the establishment of a mountaineering school in Darjeeling, which Tenzing helped to run. To avoid political embarrassment, Tenzing described himself as 'born in the womb of Nepal and raised in the lap of India,' but that was far from the whole story. Now the full story has been revealed in Webster's Snow in the Kingdom, which describes an expedition in 1988 to the rarely visited East Face of Everest which approaches the mountain through the Tibetan Kharta Valley where Tenzing's home village of Moyun is located. Included in the team was Tenzing's oldest surviving son, Norbu, who was born in the Sherpa community at Darjeeling in India where his father had started his career as a climber after migrating there in the early 1930s. Norbu, like most Sherpas, knew all about his father's secret and, while in Tibet, he was able to meet long-lost relatives, including Tenzing's half-brother Tashi, and also to solve the riddle of Tenzing's birthplace. 'If Tenzing had come out with the truth that he was, in fact, a Tibetan, he would only have magnified his nationality problems, greatly disappointing India where he then lived,' Webster told The Observer. 'It's possible some Sherpas might have ridiculed him as something of an imposter, and as a social and cultural inferior.' All of Tenzing's three wives were Sherpas and he remains a potent hero in Darjeeling and the Khumbu. 'I believe Tenzing was a sensitive and a sincere man,' says Webster. 'His writings make this clear, so Tenzing never lied outright about his family origins - but he never told the full truth either. Perhaps he believed he was simply a mountaineer, and nationality didn't matter.' During the expedition in 1988, Webster identified the monastery at Ghang La as Namdag Lhe Phodang - the 'pure god's palace' - high in the Kama Valley of Tibet. The region is very sacred to Tibetan Buddhists, regarded as a 'heavenly refuge' in times of war and famine. Tsa-chu, or more accurately Tshechu, is another holy site in a remote side-valley not far from Ghang La. The yak pastures around the monastery command a superb view of Everest and are almost certainly where Tenzing spent his childhood summers. Both the family house and the monastery were destroyed following the Chinese invasion in 1950. Ironically, the Sherpa people originated in Kham in eastern Tibet, more than 1,000 miles from Everest, and migrated to Nepal in the sixteenth century. They still number only a few thousand in a Nepali population of 22 million but are world famous for their contribution to mountaineering. While the Sherpa homeland is considered to be the Solu-Khumbu region of Nepal south of Everest, the Sherpas have always had strong cultural and economic links with Tibetans across the border. Tenzing's cousin, a famous reincarnate lama called Ngwang Tenzin Norbu, founded monasteries at Rongbuk on the Tibetan side, and at Tengpoche on the Nepali side. Tenzing Norgay's cousin also gave him his name, which means 'fortunate supporter of religion'. The tradition of mountaineers hiring Sherpas began in Darjeeling at the start of the twentieth century; the hill men quickly proved the most reliable and physically capable porters. The best Sherpas were termed 'Tigers' and awarded medals. Mountain tourism proved lucrative and more migrated from the Everest region to India. Until 1949, Nepal remained closed to almost all Europeans. For Tenzing, whose parents were struggling to make a new life for themselves in the Khumbu, Darjeeling offered a chance for economic success, but his early years there were plagued by money problems as he sought to make his mark as a porter for Western mountaineers. Tenzing never saw his father again, and didn't return to the Khumbu to see his mother until 1952. When news of his sudden fame reached his homeland in Tibet, he was overwhelmed by 'all sorts of relatives I had never seen or heard of before'. Now, Sherpas earn thousands of dollars a year helping Western clients on Everest but, with the opening of Nepal to tourism, they no longer migrate to Darjeeling to look for work. Many Sherpas have become wealthy in a country where per capita income is $200 a year. The influx of tourists to the region Tenzing helped make famous has caused environmental problems, but has also helped alleviate the economic hardship caused by the Chinese occupation of Tibet. After the invasion of Tibet in 1950, China also claimed sovereignty of the Khumbu region of Nepal, which it saw as ethnically Tibetan.They mounted a number of Sino-Tibetan expeditions to Everest following the occupation for their propaganda value and still control access to the mountain. Kate Saunders of the Tibet Information Network told The Observer: 'The Chinese will understand very well the propaganda value of Tenzing's birth. They have never wasted an opportunity to stress Chinese sovereignty in Tibet.' Perhaps Webster's most intriguing claim is that the seven-year-old Tenzing Norgay may have met George Mallory, who disappeared on Everest in 1924 and whose body was discovered last year. According to the diary of fellow climber Guy Bullock, during the first expedition to Everest in August 1921, Mallory spent a day at Tenzing's home village before trekking through the summer pastures used by Tenzing's family to the foot of the mountain's East Face. Tall tales from the world's highest peak First identified as the world's highest peak in 1856 by the Survey of India and dubbed 'Peak XV'. The name Everest was suggested by Colonel Andrew Waugh, Surveyor General, to honour his predecessor, Sir George Everest. Everest actually pronounced his name Eve-rest. So we've been saying it wrong for 135 years. Tibetans and Sherpas call the mountain Chomolungma, usually translated as 'Mother Goddess of the Earth', although Tenzing Norgay's mum said it meant the 'Mountain So High No Bird Can Fly Over It'. The true height of Everest is still controversial. Scientists in America announced in November 1999 that the true height was 8,850m, two metres higher than the previous agreed standard 8,848m. First climbed via the South Col on 29 May 1953 by Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay. Since then there have been more than 1,300 ascents and over 170 deaths. Last spring 130 people reached the summit, 80 of them via the South Col. Sherpa Babu Chiri reached the summit in 16 hours 56 minutes from Base Camp. Overcrowding on the mountain has led to punch-ups over campsites and the use of fixed ropes that now litter it. Weirdest thing on the summit: the umbilical cord of French mountaineer Thierry Renault's son. Weirdest act on the summit: an American climber performed rodeo rope tricks wearing a cowboy outfit. World newsSecret past of the man who conquered EverestSherpa Tenzing Norgay, who accompanied Edmund Hillary to the summit of the world's highest mountain in 1953, was Tibetan and not Nepalese, a new book reveals. Ed Douglas reportsEd Douglas@calmandfearlessSat 23 Dec 2000 19.51 ESTIt is one of the most romantic legends in mountaineering - the story of how a young Sherpa named Tenzing Norgay tended his father's yak herds on a high mountain pass below Everest before becoming, with Sir Edmund Hillary, the first man to reach its summit in 1953.But while Hillary and the expedition's leader Lord Hunt both believed the Sherpa had been born in a remote mountain village in Nepal, a new book by American mountaineer Ed Webster claims that not only was Tenzing born in Tibet, but he spent much of his childhood there. The world's most famous Sherpa was not really a Sherpa at all.Even after Tenzing's death in 1986, the truth was considered too sensitive to disclose, not least for fear of embarrassing the Indian government which had supported Tenzing after his ascent. It would have handed a propaganda coup to the Chinese authorities in the Tibetan capital Lhasa that a 'Chinese climber' was the first to climb Everest. But now Webster has been given permission by the family to reveal the truth about Tenzing's real origins.Throughout his life, Tenzing remained vague about his background. In his autobiography, Tiger of the Snows, he obscured the truth of his childhood without quite denying it, telling ghostwriter James Ramsey Ullman he grew up in the village of Thame, in Nepal. In fact, his parents migrated there during the early 1920s after a period of financial hardship and debt to a local Tibetan governor.Tenzing, however, was more forthcoming about his birthplace, saying: 'I was born in a place called Tsa-chu, near the great mountain of Makalu, and only a day's march from Everest.' Tenzing also explains that when he was born, his mother had been on a pilgrimage to the nearby monastery at Ghang La, the name of Tenzing's house in Darjeeling.When Tenzing climbed Everest in 1953 he was hailed by the Nepali government in Kathmandu as a local hero who happened to live in India. Nepal's fledgling constitutional monarchy feared political domination by the new Indian republic and both countries saw great propaganda value in claiming Tenzing, the first humble-born Asian of the modern era to achieve global fame, as their own.Tenzing's caution about revealing his true origins was partly explained by this political wrangling. 'After we climbed Everest,' Hillary said, 'and Tenzing was invited to England, we were really in a jam because Tenzing had no passport.' The crisis was averted only when the Indian Prime Minister Pandit Nehru stepped in and personally ensured Tenzing received an Indian passport - something for which the Nepalese authorities never forgave him.

Edmund Hillary’s son, Peter, was chief guest at the ceremony, and in a rousing speech he said development was a bit like climbing Mt Everest. “Both need dedication and teamwork, and with that nothing is impossible,” Peter Hillary told a gathering of 1,000 local Sherpas and visitors. It was a brilliantly clear day in Tengboche, with an elegantly tilted Ama Dablam looking down approvingly on the monastery. To the north, the summit of Mt Everest peeped over the Lhotse-Nuptse ridge with a plume of spindrift blowing off the summit ridge. On the south side, climbers have been waiting out high winds and may make a push on Thursday night itself when the winds are expected to ease. monastery’s Rimpoche, who has been at the forefront of efforts to preserve the environment in the Sagarmatha National Park and to clean up the trails, thanked Edmund Hillary, his family and friends for their energy and sacrifices over the past 50 years to develop Khumbu. “For the Sherpa community Edmund Hillary is like a caring parent,” the Rimpoche said. “We pray for his good health and long life.” The monastery was rebuilt after it was razed in a fire 15 years ago, and Michael Schmitz, coordinator of the Tengboche Monastery Development Project, said a visitor’s centre and expanded sacred area are being added. The meadow outside the monastery was the venue for a traditional Sherpa dance, and the New Zealanders reciprocated by performing a Maori dance.

There has been a steady stream of summiteers coming off Mt Everest.

Some Sherpas voiced private misgivings about whether the competition to set records on Everest wasn’t getting a bit out of hand. “This kind of competition is not healthy, it breeds antagonism and ill will,” said one elderly Sherpa here.

ANALYSIS by KUNDA DIXIT ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ 1 June 2001 seems like a bad dream, but Nepalis have now woken up and have decided to move on. The tragedy left scars on the national psyche that will never completely heal. All we can do is try to deal with the legacy, learn its lessons. The single most significant consequence of June First was that King Gyanendra became king. Thrust onto the throne after the death of his brother and nephew, he has tried to come to terms with a deep personal tragedy while simultaneously having to learn the essence of statecraft at the most turbulent time in the kingdom’s history. Last year, in a candid television interview, the king told Durga Nath Sharma: “I am not like my brother, I can’t sit idly by while the country sinks deeper into crisis.” What he meant by that was soon clear: Prime Minister Deuba was sacked a few months later. The king then appointed a cabinet of trusted political figures and technocrats, and got Col Narayan Singh Pun to forge a ceasefire with the Maoists. But he was less successful with trying to convince the political parties to join his government. The five parliamentary parties first went into a deep sulk, but regrouped to launch a united street agitation. In reality, they felt left out of the peace process, and had dark misgivings about the country being dragged back to pre-1990 days. It is a measure of how low the stock of the political parties has fallen that there hasn’t been a groundswell of public support for the anti-royal agitation. The public generally seems to regard this as a power play, and don’t want to jeopardise the peace process. But public opinion may shift if this stalemate drags on. A recent survey (Nepali Times, #140) showed people overwhelmingly reject a return to absolute monarchy. Girija Prasad Koirala was prime minister during the royal massacre. He is now leading the charge against the king, still threatening to disclose some mysterious “grand design”. The UML supremo Madhab Kumar Nepal refused to join the royal commission to probe the massacre, and he is now hand-in-hand with ex-rival Koirala on the streets. Speaker Taranath Ranabhat headed the commission and released the report that became the only official inquiry into the palace killings. He earned the nickname “Bhatatata” after re-enacting the murder scene by holding up one of the weapons used for the benefit of the press (pic, right). This week Ranabhat refused to join kangresi colleagues at the convening of the virtual parliament at the Academy Hall. CNN’s Satinder Bindra, in town to cover the Everest jubilee celebrations, interviews Rajendra Pandey of the UML (left) during Wednesday’s march down Singha Darbar. Pandey was later among those who suffered head injuries in scuffles with riot police (right). M I N B A J R A C H A R Y A The Maoists tried to capitalise on the uncertainty and anarchy in the weeks after 1 June, 2001. But despite government bungling Baburam Bhattarai’s conspiracy theories did not carry much weight with the public. The Nepali people, it seems, make a mental distinction between the institution of monarchy and the persona of the king. This week the Maoists are all gathered in the cradle of their revolution for an extended politburo meeting in Rolpa. The comrades are evaluating the last four months of ceasefire and plotting the next course of action. It doesn’t look like the peace process is in mortal danger, but it isn’t in the pink of health either. So, two years on, the palace and parties are stuck: the main obstacle is that no compromise candidate for prime minister is accept- able to anyone else. Things seem to be veering in the direction of an RPP-lead all-party coalition—that is if the powers-that-be can decide between Surya Bahadur Thapa and Pashupati SJB Rana. This week, the parties are bent on keeping up the pressure on the king with street protests during the Everest anniversary when the world media is in town. Meanwhile, their student wings are competing with the Maoists to disrupt education. “We have to show our fangs in public, but there is a lot of behind-the-scenes efforts to find a compromise,” admitted one party stalwart. The UML plans a “protest of unprecedented proportions” on Jesth 19. Only when an all-party interim set up is agreed on and is in place can the task of planning for the next local and general elections begin. But before we get to that: the peace talks must be concluded and the Maoists agree to disarm. \u0006 2 EDITORIAL Nepali Times is published by Himalmedia Pvt Ltd, Chief Editor: Kunda Dixit Desk Editor: Trishna Gurung, Design: Kiran Maharjan Webmaster: Bhushan Shilpakar editors@nepalitimes.com, www.nepalitimes.com Advertising: Sunaina Shah advertising@himalmedia.com Subscription: Anil Karki subscription@himalmedia.com Sales: Sudan Bista sales@himalmedia.com Sanchaya Kosh Building, Block A-4th Floor, Lalitpur GPO Box 7251, Kathmandu, Nepal Tel: 01-5543333/ 5523845 Fax: 01-5521013 Printed at Jagadamba Press, Hattiban: 01-5547018/17 INTERVIEW WITH BP Nepali Times: Mr Koirala, sir, it has been more than 20 years since you have been in self- imposed exile in heaven. This has given you a certain perspective on how things have turned out after your departure. How does it look from paradise? BP: Well, let me put it this way. It doesn’t look as bad from here as it probably does from ground level where you are. Yes, a lot of the stuff flying around may remind you of December 1960 when my parliament was dissolved and we were sent to jail by the present king’s father. But the Nepali people have come a long way since then. The 1990 constitution was not perfect (no constitution is) but it began the process of restoring sovereignty to the people. Of course, people made jokes about it: they said Nepalis are now free, but only free to complain how miserable they are. But that was precisely the point: before that they weren’t even allowed to complain. In hindsight, you could say that our expectations were too high. 1990 was an unfinished movement, it bought us time to set things right. Unfortunately, my successors squandered that period. The people were impatient, they wanted democracy to bring immediate tangible results to their lives. And it did: maternal mortality, infant mortality and literacy all got better. But the change was not dramatic enough. The people got disillusioned. Still, public opinion polls you have done down there show that people blame the leaders and not the system. It’s only the cynical Kathmandu elite that blames democracy, in the rest of Nepal democracy has struck deep roots. Democracy is the worst system in the world—except for all the others, as Winston Churchill, who is here with me, keeps saying. Yet, there seems to be an attempt to put democracy into reverse gear, will this work? No it won’t, and for the reason I just explained. But having said that, let me add that the king has a point. You could say that his October Fourth move was unconstitutional and undemocratic, but the fact is that the Maoists were at the gates. My brother, niece and former proteges were carrying on as if the only thing that mattered was to cling on to power. Our party won an absolute majority in parliament in 1999, and what did we do? We changed prime ministers three times in two years, and kept fighting each other. Kishunji had the vision and could rule by example, but he is so disappointed he has taken a vow of silence. My brother is a good fellow, he has organisa- tional skills. But his long-term vision is impaired by his obsession with day-to-day politics. I always had nothing but admiration and affection for Shailaja, in the family she alone has integrity and commitment. What the king needs now is an efficient and united team to conclude the peace process and lay the groundwork for the next elections. Speaking of the peace process. Do you think the Maoists are genuine in their offer for peace? My views on extremist communism have not changed. I would be stating the obvious if I repeated that in the dialectics of Leninism with its Maoist modifications: the end justifies the means. So the modus operandi is the same whether it is the Sandinistas or the Senderistas, they can shelve the armed struggle from time to time (even when they are winning) to infiltrate a weak government and destroy it from within because they find that an easier option. Why should our Maoists continue with a war if the cabinet cannot speak with one voice and the constitutional forces are fighting each other like cats and dogs? They can just wait for the right moment and pounce. You’ve had some time to think about this: you came back to Nepal in 1977 with the slogan of national reconciliation. Is it time for another national reconciliation? You know, I often think had I accommodated King Mahendra’s ambitions, maybe we wouldn’t have been in the wilderness for 30 years. But then, what kind of democracy would that be? You’ve got a similar situation down there now. In the row between the palace and parties, it is difficult to say which is blacker: the pot or the kettle. Both sides think they can win, but in this game there are no winners, only losers. And if both lose, what kind of Nepal will we have left? Still, it is the king who took control, and it is his responsibility to set things right. He can’t say he doesn’t have executive powers. There is nothing preventing him from calling that famous tea party for all the parties. That would set the ball rolling. A substantial discussion can then start on the composition of an interim administration. Of course, my brother will then be fighting with everyone else about berths in that cabinet, but that’s a risk that comes with the turf. So, a government of national reconciliation? Precisely. It wouldn’t be the ultimate solution, but at least it will take you out of this quagmire. The present crisis is a fantastic opportunity to reform our laws, our society, have a more inclusive democracy, and devolve power to the people through local government units. And I just don’t see what is holding things up. Actually, I do. It is the political egos of the protagonists. Do you sometimes wish you were back? Not really. I can watch it all unfold from up here. 30 MAY - 5 JUNE 2003 NEPALI TIMES #147 STATE OF THE STATE by CK LAL Let them eat cake Most schools in the country are still built-owned-operated by the government. How about improving them first? ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ H ad Maoist students suspended their agitation a little earlier, noted educationist Satyanarayan Bahadur Shrestha, 89, would have spent his last days in peace. Last week, the social reformer had to die watching the spectre of union leaders locking up school principal’s rooms. Opting out of active politics after the overthrow of the Rana regime, SB founded three prominent schools in the Kathmandu valley—Tribhuban Adarsha Vidya Mandir, Mahendra Vidyashram, and Adarsha Vidya Mandir or AVM. The Panchayat regime put a stop to private initiative in school education, and no new SB was born in the country for the next quarter of a century. Private schools made a fresh start only in the wake of the referendum-induced changes in the governance in the early eighties. But when the lid of control was lifted after the success of the People’s Movement in 1990, there was a sudden rush to open schools all over the country. Many of them began as commercial enterprises and continue to be run as such. The comfortable class was attracted by the novelty of private schools, and the bourgeoisie began to desert public schools en masse. Shorn of their best and brightest, government schools were soon caught in the vicious circle of decreasing intake, falling standard, worsening image and dwindling reputation. But, if public schools are in a mess, the lot of the ‘English Boarding Schools’ in the country aren’t any better. There is an urgent need to bring private schools in the ambit of some kind of a regulatory mechanism. The reform must begin by accepting that private schools are here to stay. They can’t be wished away howsoever the egalitarians may want them to. In the medium term at least, it is pointless to bemoan the class distinction that the private schools are creating. Since even the Maoist leadership has publicly endorsed the role of private capital in its ‘New Model’ of democracy, the right to exercise free choice can’t be denied to any discerning consumer. Second, agitating students had erred grievously by putting all private schools in one category. All public schools may be more or less the same, but private schools can be categorised into at least four groups: Deluxe, Exclusive, Superior and Economy. In order to make them more socially relevant, each one of them needs a different approach of monitoring and evaluation. It would be counter-productive to insist that Deluxe schools decrease their fees. These cater to the status needs of well-off parents. High fees are their USP. If they were to reduce their charges, they would immediately lose their customers to pricey competitors in Mussoorie, Shimla, Darjeeling or Kodaikanal. Deluxe schools need to be encouraged to hike their fees and add more glamour to their bouquet—riding club, polo, sauna and heated swimming pools are not luxuries for kids likely to be chauffeured to their school in Japanese SUVs. If status defines deluxe schools, it’s aspiration that drives ambitious parents to Exclusive schools. The rush to get into the Exclusive schools is fuelled by the desire of upper class parents in their Marutis and Santros to be keep up and be one up on the Janardan next door. A ceiling on fee is not the correct way of regulating Exclusive schools either. It would be more appropriate to oversee the functioning of such schools by an independent body patterned after consumer courts. They should be made to open their accounts, not lock them up. All Deluxe and Exclusive schools must publish their balance sheets periodically, and pay certain royalty on their turnover. Some of the Deluxe and Exclusive schools are akin to Export Promotion Zones for human resources. Further corporatisation of these two categories of schools would be a sensible option. If the government has no objection to the commercialisation of health services, why whine about efficiently managed quality schools? Capacity is the key strength of Superior schools, and they can use the economy of scale to cut their prices to a certain extent. But even in this category, growth in supply hasn’t been able to keep up with the spiralling demand. Most Superior schools are so overloaded that they can’t fiddle with the student to teacher ratio any further. All that the government can do is to ask the management of these schools to keep their books open for the guardians and the press. That leaves the bulk—the Economy class of private schools. Most of these me-to enterprises are shoestring mom- and-pop operations. If they are making any money, it must be by fleecing teachers, not by over-charging parents. There is no way fees of these schools can be reduced without forcing them to pay their staff sweatshop wages. With the parents who send their children to any of these private schools, fee is seldom the core issue. The affordability and willingness to pay govern access to private schools. The market forces govern values of their services. There is very little that the government can do except monitoring to see that these schools deliver what they promise. Agitating students affiliated to political parties are barking up the wrong tree. To check the commercialisation of school education, it’s much more sensible to begin by improving the condition of government schools—about 80 percent of all schools in the country are still built-owned-operated by the government. But that is another story. \u0006 E X P E N S I V E S C H O O L S Re: 'Parents mobilise' (#146). As foreigners, we have the means to send our Nepali foster son to one of the best private schools—and one that runs without foreign funding. As Europeans we can testify that its educational standards are higher than those afforded to us in Germany and Austria when we went to school. We often envy the boy for the chance he has to be in such a good school and for being so happy with it. Schools like this one are essential for the country, because they provide what most other public and private schools do not: better education. As the privileged upper classes of Nepal, its politicians, and even Maobadi leaders know very well, the only alternative is to send their offspring for appropriate education to boarding schools far and abroad. We feel strongly, L L L L L E T T E R S E T T E R S E T T E R S E T T E R S E T T E R S however, that children during their formative years should stay close to their families, near their rich culture. High and “unjustified” school fees are targets of the present agitation against private schools, but “expensive” is a relative term depending on your own values, and on what to compare. If one believes, as we do, that primary and secondary education should be free for all children, then any fee may be deemed expensive. But education costs money (high standards cost even more), and Nepal is not Europe (or Cuba, just to name another poor country) where all taxpayers together share the expenses for good public education. If the state does not provide it, parents will have to. Unfortunately, Nepal has hitherto failed to establish a well-suited educational system for all. And to claim, after decades and in spite of millions of aid funds, a literacy rate of 50 percent to be a success is a joke. What has been achieved from learning by rote is to be able to read a Sanscritised form of Nepali— that many of these 50 percent do not even speak in their homes. And where are the vocational schools, so important for the development of a country like this? Since the people of Nepal, its civic society and its private sector, have stepped in where successive governments failed, it is only natural that also the quality aspects of learning have gained importance. We deem it good for the country that at least some private schools have developed high and even international standards of education, although only a limited number of Nepal’s children have yet access to them. It is understandable that many who want the best for their children may find school fees expensive, if they can not afford them. Yet they have a choice: to evaluate carefully what quality education means for their children, to change their values and preferences if needed, and— for the long term—to help changing the system of governance for the better. But do not go the way of Pol Pot in Cambodia and destroy one of the pillars of development, which is quality education. Pay or fight for it with whatever you can, until all children of Nepal get the same chance! Ludmilla Hungerhuber and Goetz Hagmueller, Bhaktapur RNA Thanks for the article ‘Why do we need tanks?’ by Kanak Mani Dixit (#145), which was to the point. There are just two things for the writer to consider. The first is deduce how much of the arms spree is to “boost the capability” of the Royal Nepali Army (RNA), and how much to intimidate the Maoists? To somewhat paraphrase von Calusewitz, (re)arming is also negotiations by other means. And, second, a civilian oversight of security matters is essential. I’m surprised the writer left the paragraph unfinished. This is where the role of the Defence Council comes in. So far it has only played a symbolic role and it needs to be vested with powers to monitor security matters and determine national policy from a broader perspective, rather than on the basis of knee jerk reactions. The NATION ANALYSIS 30 MAY - 5 JUNE 2003 NEPALI TIMES #147 3 by MICHAEL HUTT Still unbecoming citizens Bottom line: Bhutan is still playing for time on refugee repatriation. have been categorised as ‘voluntary emigrants’. Some 20 percent are said to have been categorised as non- Bhutanese, and 3 percent as Bhutanese criminals. According to the MJC’s joint press release, the ‘bonafide Bhutanese evicted forcibly’, ie around 375 persons, will be permitted to return as full citizens, while those ‘voluntary emigrants’ who wish to return will be given the option of re-applying for Bhutanese citizenship. Non-Bhutanese will have to return to their own countries, and Bhutanese criminals will have to return to stand trial. It is the ‘voluntary emigrants’ category that causes the greatest concern. It has long been known that a large number of people in the camps in Jhapa and Morang were in danger of falling into this category. It was always likely that a particularly high proportion would be found in Khudunabari, because this camp was the last to be established, well after the Bhutanese authorities had achieved a thorough bureaucratisation of the eviction process. The ‘voluntary emigrants’ include people who were coerced into signing emigration forms, people who signed written commitments to leave the country in order to secure the release of relatives imprisoned for political offences, people who simply fled from a generalised state of fear and insecurity, and so on. Drawing on research published by Kanak Mani Dixit and Amnesty International, I have discussed a number of such cases in my book, Unbecoming Citizens. Many of us had hoped that the long delay in finalising the verification report was being caused by protracted negotiations over such cases. We hoped that the true reasons for flight were being clarified and that a number of people were being transferred to category 1 once it was proved that their ‘emigration’ had been far from ‘voluntary’. It seems that we were wrong, and that the Nepali side in the negotiations has taken this category at face value, without delving into the multifarious reasons for flight. Perhaps this was because the Bhutanese authorities offered them a compromise: if the Nepalis agreed not to challenge any ‘voluntary emigrant’ categorisations, the Bhutanese would allow such individuals to apply for repatriation. One can only speculate. Whatever the reasons, the people categorised as ‘voluntary emigrants’ will shortly be faced with a difficult choice. They may apply for Bhutanese citizenship (even though their categorisation implicitly accepts that they were citizens before they left Bhutan) but it seems that no decisions will be reached on these applications for a period of two years after their repatriation. The Bhutanese Foreign Minister has stated that citizenship will be granted in accordance with the citizenship laws of Bhutan. But Bhutanese citizenship laws stipulate periods of residence of 15 or 20 years for citizenship by naturalisation and require applicants to have a thorough knowledge of Dzongkha. How would these requirements apply in these circumstances? Furthermore, if these ‘voluntary emigrants’ returned to Bhutan, where would they live? Most if not all of them owned houses and land in southern Bhutan, but many of their houses were demolished after their departure and many others were handed over to people from northern Bhutan in government resettlement schemes. Indeed, some of the districts from which people fled over a decade ago now contain the bases of Assamese and Bodo insurgents. Is the Bhutanese government truly establishing ‘transit camps’ to house the returnees, as rumoured? And how would these returnees earn a living? Would they return to their lives as self-sufficient tax-paying farmers, or would they be placed in labour camps? Would they be afforded any rights, to healthcare, education and so on? The evidence of continued discrimination against even those ethnic Nepalis who remain in Bhutan, as recently revealed by Human Rights Watch, is ominous. Why would any sane individual choose to entrust his family’s future to a government from which he once fled, when his family’s basic needs are being met in an environment that may allow them no prospect of advancement or improvement, but which is essentially benign? Without any guarantees or safeguards, and in the absence of any third party involvement in the repatriation process, the Bhutanese offer begs many questions. We must earnestly hope that no pressure will be applied to those who are reluctant to respond positively to it. The fact that the government media in Nepal is presenting these talks as a qualified success raises the suspicion that HMG Nepal does not understand the processes that led to these people becoming refugees or, worse still, is uninterested in finding a solution informed by justice rather than expediency. \u0006 (Michael Hutt, PhD, is the author of Unbecoming Citizens and reader in Nepali and Himalayan Studies at the School of Oriental and African Studies, London.) ecent months have witnessed a certain warmth in the long- troubled relationship between R the governments of Bhutan and Nepal, and a growing recognition that the two India-locked Himalayan kingdoms have commercial and political interests in common. This might have been expected to bode well for the 100,000 ‘people in the refugee camps in Jhapa and Morang’ who have been awaiting a just settlement of their plight with extraordinary dignity and patience for up to 12 years. Ten long years ago, the two governments agreed to divide the refugees into four categories: (1) bonafide Bhutanese evicted forcibly, (2) Bhutanese who left as voluntary emigrants, (3) non-Bhutanese, and (4) Bhutanese criminals. It took a further eight years for the actual verification process to begin, and nearly nine months for it to be completed in just one camp: Khudunabari, the home of some 12,500 people. In the monsoon rains of 2001, I watched the buses come and go between Khudunabari and the Joint Verification Team’s office in Damak. Several extended families were delivered each day, their children scrubbed and polished, for this first opportunity to prove that they were who they said they were. Levels of optimism were high. The completion of the exercise was followed by many months of frustrating silence and inactivity and its outcome remained a mystery. The process did not restart until early 2003, after Bhutanese officials reassured international donors at a meeting in Geneva of their commitment to finding a solution to the refugee problem. The two verification teams spent many weeks in secret discussions in Thimphu before presenting their report to the fourteenth meeting of the Ministerial Joint Committee (MJC), recently concluded in Kathmandu. The announcement that followed has come as a shock. It is widely believed that only 3 percent of the population of Khudunabari camp have been categorised as ‘bonafide Bhutanese evicted forcibly’, while some 75 percent Maoist threat has made it clear that modernisation of the army is essential, but it needs to be done through capacity building that will improve the overall performance of the army. Acquiring better armaments is only one part of it, but it needs to be followed by qualitative, rather than quantitative, development of its manpower and greater intelligence capacity. Meanwhile, the Armed Police Force is already redundant, though nothing has been done to scrap it, or partially absorb it (within the RNA and Police) after the army took the lead security role after the state of emergency. National crises can always lead to a call for arms, which unchecked can develop a momentum of its own that can drain the economy and bring in unnecessary equipment into the country. The key in any democratic system is accountability. We cannot pretend to cling on to the system, without accepting this essential precondi- tion. GB Chhetri,Mumbai NEVEREST While the world celebrates 50 years of Everest, it might be time for Nepalis to think about naming their highest peak Neverest. Mt Everest certainly supports the image of a mountain and its people ever resting and doing nothing more. Neverest has the opposite connotation—that of Nepalis and their highest peak awakening from a deep slumber. Jack Prasai,Cape Town PUSKAR It’s hard enough for Nepalis living abroad to maintain their cultural identity without a journalist of your calibre making overblown statements in ‘Love thy neighbour’ (#145), among them, “Most Nepalis speak better Hindi than former Indian prime minister HD Deve Gowda.” At the orientation program when I first joined university I told my disbelieving Indian friends that no, I didn’t speak Hindi and neither do many of my fellow Nepalis. The prevailing attitude seems to be to look upon Nepal as more than just a friendly neighbour, almost another Indian state. We may have centuries of links with India, but the current circumstances demand for us to be independent from Indian influence. Look at our politicians—if it’s a rainy day in India, they get out their umbrellas. And the king is not exempt. His recent ‘religious’ visit south of the border was a thinly veiled excuse for a little power play. Interdependence is a pretty political theory but we must maintain our own sovereignty. Bhusal should realise the media plays an important role in expanding, broadening and bolstering our national identity. Surendra R Shrestha, Sydney \u0006 The parliamentary parties don't see what is right in front of them. There seems to be a very cordial relationship between the Maoists and the government, this is extremely sinister and damaging to the multiparty democratic system. Just consider some facts: - IGP Krishna Mohan Shrestha is murdered a few days before the ceasefire, the government is apathetic, and the confessed killer is released. - The Maoists seem more eager to reach an agreement with a puppet government rather than a duly elected government. - The government's eagerness to comply with every demand of the Maoists, including those concerning security. - The indifference of the state towards ceasefire violations by the Maoists. - The government's strong-arm tactics against the political parties on the streets, but its tolerance of the activities of their student wing. - The government's negligence towards the demands of the student unions for elections. - The Maoists graudually shedding all their major demands except those which ensure the scrapping of the democratic constitution. - The government and the Maoists saying in one voice that the public must not question their actions because it will damage the peace process. The strategy seems to be clear: get the royal government to hold elections to ensure a fair amount of seats for former Panchas and Maoists. This way, they will control parliamentary proceedings by proxy. \"The snake is dead, the stick is not broken.\" Donors who have a genuine interest in the development of democracy must not be waylaid by an illusory peace process by two groups who will benefit from democracy's demise. Ram Bahadur Moktan, USA 4 NATION 30 MAY - 5 JUNE 2003 NEPALI TIMES #147 The Fortunate Son through to achieve the status he enjoys today. But an increasing number, among them lyricist Thapa, believe Tenzing, the man and the climber, has been overlooked in the fanfare of commemorating the first successful human ascent of Mt Everest. A seminar organised on Tuesday by Himal Association and The Mountain Institute was an occasion to pay tribute to the man who has often been sidelined in the media. Forestry expert Lhakpa Norbu Sherpa who has been studying Tenzing’s childhood, revealed a different side to the mountaineer. Born in a Tibetan village in Kharta Valley in May 1914, young Tenzing’s early childhood was spent in severe poverty and hardship. Life on the high plateau where his parents were wage herders was so difficult that only six out of 14 of Tenzing’s siblings survived into adulthood. He made the long journey on foot with his mother and brothers across the Himalaya to Thame valley in Nepal in search of a better life. Life as a yak herder in Khumbu was slightly easier, but he later migrated to Darjeeling in India at the age of 18 to try to get a job as a mountaineering porter. Many Sherpa lads were headed that way because of the demand from British expeditions trying to explore and climb Everest from the north. Tenzing’s first break was the Everest Expedition led by Eric Shipton in 1935, and he made several other unsuccessful attempts at the summit. In Kharta, Tenzing’s family was ill-treated and exploited because they belonged to the lowest economic and social strata. Some ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ HEMLATA RAI Tenzing your immortality is assured. Your name is written in gold. You will always be honoured for 29 May when the highest peak in the world bowed to kiss your feet… You reached the top, looked down at the world, and helped others climb… Tenzing, the world smiles with pride at you. Fifty years ago, Nepal’s folk- singer-in-chief, Dharma Raj Thapa wrote those lines after Tenzing Norgay reached the summit of Everest with his New Zealand counterpart, Sir Edmund Hillary. Today, the octogenarian singer and writer feels that Tenzing never received enough respect or credit for his contribution in making the Sherpa community and Nepal famous around the world. Legend has it that Tenzing’s real name was Namgyal Wangdi but a rimpoche changed it to Tenzing Norgay, meaning ‘fortunate’, a prophecy that came to happy fruition when he reached the summit of Sagarmatha and became a celebrity. From then on, he became the favoured son of the Sherpa people, their ambassador to the outside world. Tenzing’s career in high altitude adventure closely reflects the hardships he went his nationality. After 29 May 1953, everyone was keen to embrace him. “Both Nepal and India needed a hero and a role model during a time of dramatic political changes,” says writer Deepak Thapa who has been researching the life of Tenzing. When Tenzing travelled across the Himalaya in search of a better life, he did so with no regard to political boundaries. American mountaineer Ed Webster’s biography of Tenzing Norgay, Snow in The Kingdom created quite a stir when it said he was born in Tibet instead of Thame as believed earlier. Webster says both Sir Hillary and Lord Hunt, the leader of the1953 expedition, believed he was born in a remote mountain village in Nepal but the truth was concealed to avoid embarrassing India. The fact that Tenzing eventually chose to settle down permanently in Darjeeling where he lived till his death in 9 May 1986 must have felt like a rejection to many nationalistic Nepalis. “Tenzing had a simplicity and humility about him but even then he must have felt eclipsed by the adulation the world showered on Edmund Hillary,” says Lhakpa Norbu. He points out that while Sir Edmund Hillary was granted an honorary Nepali citizenship earlier this week, Tenzing—who deserves the equal honour—has been largely ignored. “If the Nepali government wants to honour my father with an honorary citizenship we will welcome it,” said Jamling Norgay, Tenzing’s son, “but he was a personality beyond any political boundary.” For Brian Penniston of The Mountain Institute, the point about nationality is moot. He says: “Birds don’t have passports.” \u0006 A Y R A H C A R J A B N I M From l- r: Tenzing’s son Jamling, Dharma Raj Thapa and grandson Tashi Tenzing. say this was why he chose not to return to Tibet, even though his father, Minga, remained there and died shortly after the family migrated. Tenzing married thrice, all of them were Sherpa women. He became an adviser and the guiding spirit at the Himalayan Mountaineering Institute (HMI) after his appointment in May 1976. Sherpas make up one-fourth of those who climbed Sagarmatha and one-third of those who died there, but they rarely merit a mention anywhere. But geographer Harka Gurung says Tenzing was always different from other Sherpas. “He had a different perspective on the whole business of climbing. For one thing he understood the Western concept of ‘earning a name’.” Although he spoke seven languages, Tenzing never learned how to write but dictated his books that provide a timeless account of an era when the high Himalayan frontiers were still unexplored. In his autobiography Tiger of the Snows, The Autobiography of Tenzing of Everest he says, “It has been a long road...from a mountain coolie, a bearer of loads, to a wearer of a coat with rows of medals who is Nepal remembers Tenzing carried about in planes and worries about his income tax.” Two major points of controversy surrounding Tenzing are who got to the top first and the matter of his nationality. With regard to the first, in his autobiography Tenzing writes, “A little below the summit Hillary and I stopped. We looked up. Then we went on. The rope that joined us was thirty feet long, but I held most of it in loops in my hand, so that there was only about six feet between us. I was not thinking of ‘first’ and ‘second’. I did not say to myself, ‘There is a golden apple up there. I will push Hillary aside and run for it.’ We went on slowly, steadily. And then we were there. Hillary stepped on top first. And I stepped up after him.” Throughout his life he maintained they climbed the mountain as a team. The discrepancy probably arises from a press statement following the summit where Hillary wrote they made it “almost together”, adding to the speculation. And then there is the detail of HERE AND THERE by DANIEL LAK Old Yerp, New Europe I nadvertently, the Bush administration may have done something rather useful as it blunders among the diplomatic and human debris of its ongoing Iraq fiasco. I say “inadvertently” because I am convinced that history will show that this gaggle of mediocrities and ideologues rarely if ever achieve the stated goal of their policies, up to and including military interventions in sovereign countries. But such blunders can produce unintended side effects, call them collateral benefits if you will. Consider, for example, the blusterings of Donald Rumsfeld before the foray into Iraq. The Defence Secretary—once described to me by a Republican party insider as “not fit to drive the White House lawnmower”—used the term “old Europe” to deride those who opposed invading Iraq: France, Germany and so on. Others like Bulgaria and Spain, supporters of US policy each for their own rather selfish reasons, were “the new Europe”. At the time, this touched off a wave of derision among that vast majority of European people in all countries who preferred to let the United Nations disarm Iraq peacefully, or at least to do so without killing thousands of people and wrecking billions of dollars worth of property and infrastructure. Interestingly, not too many of those Euro citizens were offended by the comments of Herr Signor Monsieur Comte de la Rumsfeld. For one thing, they were pleased that he could pronounce the name of the continent in two syllables, unlike his boss, who kept telling us about some place called “Yerp”. Self-confidence may be a largely American invention but the Europeans seem to be adapting many of the good things that come across the Atlantic, ignoring the bad. Neo-liberal economic commentators, the kind that dominate the business media in Britain and America, are fond of telling us that Old Europe is about to collapse. Its post-war consensus that marries socially inclusive welfare policies with aggressive corporatism was failing, it was Both are doing very well despite neo-liberal predictions of imminent collapse. Americans stay at home, quivering in a post-9-11, post-Iraq funk. What about France then? Old Europe all the way, right? Well, if old Europe means the best health care system in the world, bar none, bring on the Zimmer Frame for les citoyennes Francaise. Waiting times for major surgery in France are lower than in any other important country in the world, and the French are far, far healthier than most of the rest of us, especially we waddling North Americans. Equality of access to care, but also equality of income, are great health levelers. Okay, there are growing social tensions among a radicalised North African Muslim population but what big, open society doesn’t struggle with issues of identity and culture amid growing immigration? And just in passing, ponder Denmark’s colossal aid budget, Sweden’s export driven socialism, Holland’s endless stability and civilised social environment, Belgium’s economic success despite bitter communal hatreds. I could even praise Spain for its booming regional economies and again, a health care system that American rightists would deride as “socialised medicine”. But unlike Rumsfeld, I don’t regard thrusting out the tongue and going “nyahnyah, nyah-nyan-nyah” as a substitute for civilised discourse. You may have noticed that old Europe is being rather useful in the new Iraq, and you can bet it will continue to be so. A collateral benefit, I’m sure. \u0006 affirmed, staggering under low growth rates, budget deficits and lack of market confidence. Germany is generally touted as the leading offender here but many a neo-lib looks longingly at France, willing it frail with all his flinty little heart. But the fact is that Europe—old and new—is doing rather well, thank you. Germany continues to produce goods that the world wants: its workers, bosses and ministers pull together. There are problems, there are things that need to change, there may even be (gasp) a little labour strife. But overall, Germany remains a wealthy and humane society. Ask it’s citizens about their seven weeks annual holiday, and then ask all the tourist destinations that are awash in German Euros, even as Polyanna North NATION Gyalzen and Kanchha Gyalzen Sherpa, 84(pic, left bottom), and Kanchha Sherpa, 71(pic, left top), were contemporaries of Tenzing Norgay. The sirdar trained and housed them in Darjeeling, and was instrumental in finding them jobs and promoting them from coolies to high altitude porters, opening the door for them to becoming sirdars themselves. Gyalzen and Kanchha were also a part of the British 1953 expedition with Tenzing. The two accompanied Hillary on a horse-drawn carriage this week, just as Tenzing himself did in 1953. Both were ecstatic. They are dazzled by the pomp and ceremony of the Everest Golden Jubilee celebrations, and say this is the first time Nepal has feted their part in the success of the expedition. With pride they speak of the time Queen Elizabeth II awarded the whole team medals and Rs 500 each in cash. As a child Kanchha was used to travelling the high passes to Tibet with his trader father. “Poverty pushed us into difficult jobs and at that time we had no alternatives,” he says. In the 1953 expedition he transported food, set up tents and acted as a liaison between the porters and their employers. With a tinge of regret, Kanccha says he was never considered a climber although he made it to the South Col six times. Gyalzen nods his head in sympathy but thanks the mountain goddess for the change in fortune of Sherpas like him. “What does remain the same is the style of mountaineering despite the increase in facilities,” says Gyalzen, recalling when Sherpa porters were paid less than Rs 8 a day, Rs 10 if you were going up to South Col. Khumbu has changed beyond the imagination of Gyalzen and Kanchha: the population has almost tripled, electricity and piped water is available and the staple diet has moved from millet to corn and now rice. Many are still poor, but tourism has brought in money and more opportunities. Today Gyalzen is one of the richest people in Namche Bazar, and his children do not need to risk their lives on the mountains. He has been on several Everest expeditions with Swiss, British and Indian teams between 1952 and1965, but confesses the most interesting one by far was in 1956. “We set out to look for a yeti, but found nothing,” he says with a smile.

The solution could be a new campaign from the Environment and Public Health Organisation (ENPHO) and Clean Energy Nepal (CEN) that makes clean water accessible to the poor through a simple technology called solar water disinfection (SODIS). Experiments show that exposing water in one or two-litre pet bottles (old mineral water or soft drink bottles work well) to sunlight for 6-7 hours removes over 95 percent of bacterial contamination. ENPHO and CEN say the technology not only saves lives but also lowers monetary and energy costs.

Before scurrying for an answer, savour the splendour of Ralf Dahrendorf’s survey (#146). Nepalis, after all, aren’t the only people in almost perpetual democratic despair. The revelation comes by the end of the third paragraph. With turnout averaging over 60 percent during partyless and multiparty polls alike, we seem to be a far more exuberant lot on Election Day than our counterparts in some of the mature democracies Dahrendorf writes about. Voter turnout can give a misleading picture of Nepalis’ sense of civic obligation, especially when elections come with considerable supplementary value. The polling station is where the next cycle of factional skirmishes, ministerial strife and desultory denunciations starts. No one who has anything better to do would want to miss the thrill. Factor in the patronage—both in cash and kind— that inspires multiple voting and you can understand how no midterm election can come too soon. Even if popular dissatisfaction with elections is serious, it can’t be something to lose sleep over. The emotion is an extension of our love-hate relationship with the political class.

Since he’s neither an ardent Maoist nor an absolute monarchist, critics might feel emboldened to use Dahrendorf exegesis to excoriate the “winner-take- all” electoral system. True, proportional representation could have given smaller and disadvantaged groups the opportunity to air their grievances from the legislative podium over the last 12 years. With 13 MPs, Bam Dev Gautam’s would have been the third largest party in the last house. With six members, Chand’s would have ranked just above Nepal Sadbhavana Party.

From the erstwhile German Democratic Republic to the extant Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, the d-word proved to be an adjectival misnomer. In nations with less ostentatious names, democracy once thrived without women voters. Slave-owners could explicate without the slightest compunction how all men were created equal. Flags fluttered as emblems of equality while the empires they represented eviscerated over half the world. The scars still fester in the cultural-relativism chapter of textbooks. That’s why we need to take our deliberations a step forward and affirm it amplifies our current woes. Take the average popular vote the three biggest parties polled in the last three elections. Under proportional representation, we might be in for a perpetually hung parliament where the Rastriya Prajatantra Party— divided or united—would hold one of the keys to power. Throw in the provision for direct elections for prime minister as a safeguard. We might end up with a leader ready to dissolve the house at the first provocation. If we institute a fixed- term legislature, we can expect to be stuck with members with a precise idea of the date and time they feel they are entitled to squabble up to. What about the newfound camaraderie between Kangresis and comrades? Once they feel they have nothing to jointly struggle for, they would return to savaging each other. Under every electoral system, some people are always going to feel excluded. So the streets would continue to seethe and shutters would still come down. And our faith of the ballot box? We’d have to check voter turnout first. \u0006 COMMENT by SHANTA DIXIT Band-aid or death knell? P rivate schools have borne the brunt of the Maoist wrath for several years. Recently, students affiliated to a ‘revolutionary’ union of students locked up the accounts sections and principal’s offices of private schools in the Valley. They were finally opened on condition that the government determine identical fees for all private schools by the evening of 14 June. For those who care to look into the future of quality schooling in Nepal, this decision is not so much a momentary band-aid as it is a death knell. Those who possess no serious work ethic are the ones using students as political pawns and holding education hostage. People who have neither created nor contributed anything to shape the nation’s education needs are destroying what others have. As if that were not enough, we have to deal with consultants who advocate quick-fix monetary solutions. They don’t seem to care that education is not about literacy, but raising concerned, responsible citizens. It is only when we create a generation of positive minded individuals by nurturing their sense of self-worth that we can hope for a better Nepal. Private schools emerged as the public’s response to the failing government education system that was the legacy of the Panchayat years. In the decade of democracy they flourished. The time was coming for a further evolution—improving government schooling using private education as a template and developing Nepal as a regional education hub. Can a decision that needs homework, public hearings and interested party compliance be made with a Maoist pistol held at the head? Does the present government understand the implications of the ad-hoc decisions it takes. Given the lack of comprehension and concern shown thus far by the bureaucratic and political leadership, there is little room for hope. Much of the Ministry of Education’s policies are two will provide exactly the same facility. Neither should there be a ceiling on the price of private education. Fees should be charged according to facilities provided, and standards must be maintained according to fees paid. Another contradiction: the Maoists and the ‘experts’ are both keen to lower the costs of schooling for Nepalis who can more than afford to pay for it. Why? Parents who send children to cheap private schools get no reprieve. This is progressive taxation turned on its head, in which the richest get the most concessions. Is this Nepal’s version of Maoism? In a democracy, it is every citizen’s right to want quality education for their children—commensurate with what they are willing and able to pay. The government, on its part, must provide standard quality education for those unable to send their children to private schools. In Nepal, private schools pick up the govern- ment’s burden by providing education to 15 percent of the student population. If government schools became centres of quality and excellence, there would be no reason for private schools to exist. The focus should be on helping the govern- ment. Instead, quality private schools are being throttled. The international community is deeply involved in education: the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, UNDP, UNICEF, DANIDA, NORAD, DfID, Save the Children coalition as well as others have invested millions of rupees over the years without witnessing much advances in the actual quality of schooling. They must see how illogical it is to destroy the only thing that works. If money can’t improve the quality of government schools what will? The sad state of government schools is cumulative bureuacratic neglect and direct politicisation of education by narrow-minded leaders. Private schools are easy scapegoats for those who failed to improve government schools. today being decided by consultants who are paid top dollar to spout easy progressive sounding slogans. They do slipshod work and get away with it because education is considered a ‘dull’ sector. So fly-by-nights who have no experience in running institutions, and share no empathy with students, parents or teachers are put in charge. These ‘experts’ think that balancing the budget is all it takes to define policy, which is how one particular individual proposed the magic figure of $30 per child annually as the standard school fee. Even the government spends more per child than this amount. Decisions on education are being taken with the will to punish those who are delivering quality, without an understanding of educational philosophy and its implementation worldwide. It is unnatural to set a standard fee for all private schools because no In the meantime, those who have kept silent thinking that this anti-private school campaign is only momentary theatrics need to wake up. Our passivity has pushed the country’s educational superstructure to the brink. Every guardian and parent, scholar and planner who recognise the country’s need for a healthy private-public partnership must counter-agitate so a social ‘stay order’ is put on all the street drama. Only then will it be appropriate to soberly examine the strengths and weaknesses of private schools and chart out a course that will benefit the nation’s future. They say it takes a village to raise a child. Unfortunately, at the moment the village that is our nation is failing its responsibility. \u0006 (Shanta Dixit is an educator associated with RBS in Patan.)

The changes brought about by a stronger economy can, to some extent, salvage this country. And the Beed is happy to suggest a course of action—at least to begin with. All the media hungry politicos and their sidekicks who are vying for the limelight should put down their placards, pipe down and let Everest have it’s day. \u0006 Readers can post their comments or suggestions to arthabeed@yahoo.com S U B H A S R A I N epal’s image in the international media over the last week closely resembles Subhas Rai’s brilliant illustration for Nepali Times (#146) of all the goings on at Everest Base Camp— the media spotlight rivals that which followed the tragic events of 1 June 2001. Never one to shy away from publicity, our beloved political parties have decided to milk the situation for all it’s worth: protest programs are being organised, there are rumblings from the Maoist camp about withdrawing from the peace talks and students are threatening to close missionary schools. Countrywide protests against the Commission for the Investigation for the Abuse of Authority (CIAA) in support of politicians and officials suspected of corruption is final proof that the junta are no longer thinking. In effect we are broadcasting a clear message to the world. We support corruption but still expect funding for good governance from foreign donors. We are well aware of how reliant we are on tourism, but are quite willing to sabotage any attempt to jumpstart the ailing sector by disrupting jubilee celebrations. The Beed sees far too many cases of cutting the nose to spite the face. The past shows that we have made a habit of it. In 2000, a bandh was declared during the WWF conference, the biggest in our country’s history. Other popular days to shut the country down are on New Year’s Eve and 1 January, profitable times for the tourism and service industries. Assistance in corruption control cannot be justified if those accused seek refuge in loopholes of the law. We cannot talk about devolution of power as our leaders jockeying for power. It’s impossible to make a show of faith to foreign investors when domestic businesses are moving out. We may have international road shows on Destination Nepal but somehow we bungle up every major tourism event. Our education sector desperately needs an overhaul but ironically the lackeys of the major political parties want to close the few good schools still in operation. Our myopia is dragging us down. It is not the Beed’s way to be so doggedly pessimistic, so perhaps we can latch onto some hope for the future. A start would be to stop being so near sighted about our goals. We need to bridge the yawning chasm between the rich and poor, create more jobs and provide better health Solo without oxygen The blizzard of 50th anniversary events has eclipsed Reinhold Messner’s spectacular first climb without oxygen and first ever solo climb of Sagarmatha. REINHOLD MESSNER ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ W hen we proposed climbing Everest without oxygen in 1978 people told us it wasn’t possible, that we were risking our lives. They said we would lose our brains up there. When the first climbers on the Austrian expedition we joined came down, they said we shouldn’t even try. It was hard: I didn’t know if I’d have a chance to go back to Everest, and Everest is Everest. I was determined then to try and get as high as possible. Climbing Everest solo without bottled oxygen in 1980 was the hardest thing I’ve ever done. I was alone up there, completely alone. I fell down a crevasse at night and almost gave up. Only because I had this fantasy—because for two years I had been pregnant with this fantasy of soloing Everest—was I able to continue. When you’re high on a mountain you cannot be anything but what you are. Mallory said he climbed Everest because it was there. I think we go up so we can come back down again. This coming down is a very strong experience. You come back from an inhuman place. We are not made for it, this loneliness and cold. When you come back you feel reborn, you have a new chance. The experience is so strong you want to have it again and again, but you have to suffer for it. It’s addictive. This is what I had got as a child, without even thinking: I could find a good route, understand the weather quickly, know that this rock is good, if this gully will go to the left. I had learnt the structure of the mountain. Until I was 20 my parents helped me with my climbing. When my father realised it was going to be my life, he tried to stop me, but it was too late. And when I went to Everest in 1978 to climb it without oxygen, he would sit in his local bar and say I was crazy. When I succeeded he said: “I knew he would do it!” My father blamed me for my brother Günther’s death, for not bringing him home. He died in an avalanche as we descended from the summit of Nanga Parbat, one of the 14 peaks over 8,000m, in 1970. Günther and I did so much together. It was difficult for my father to understand what it was like up there. On Nanga Parbat I understood the reality of my own death. I had not eaten or drunk anything for days, I was hallucinating, my toes were black from frostbite and my brother was lost in the avalanche. When I lost seven of my toes on Nanga Parbat and small parts of my fingertips I knew I’d never be a great rock climber. So I specialised in high-altitude climbing. It’s a totally different game. I developed a 15-year passion for it and became maybe even a little narrow-minded in my desire for 8,000m peaks. It’s certainly partly my fault that today 8,000m peaks are something special. To be honest, they are not that special. After my brother died it took me a year to recover, but I knew I could do more. I knew it must be possible to climb one of these big mountains without fixed ropes and so on, so I tried to solo Nanga Parbat in 1973. But it wasn’t possible then to be up there alone, having no one to speak with, no other faces. It took me a long time to learn how to do that. High-altitude climbing is about suffering, it’s about being afraid. I don’t believe anyone who says there’s a lot of pleasure in climbing the biggest peaks. It’s dangerous, especially if there are no Sherpas or fixed ropes and camps. If you make one mistake, you die. I was the first man to climb the world’s 14 tallest peaks without supplementary oxygen, but I never asked how high I would go, just how I would do it. Climbing is more of an art than a sport. It’s the aesthetics of a mountain that compels me. The line of a route, the style of ascent. It is creative. Children have to find their own way. My way is wrong for my kids. They climb, but I’m not forcing them into it. I was elected an MEP for the Green Party. Politics and climbing are exact opposites. But they’re both games. If the world’s leaders could spend a few days climbing a mountain together, then things would go better. I always take the same perspective with each new adventure. I put myself in the position of being at the end of my life looking back. Then I ask myself if what I am doing is important to me. The Shackleton Endurance expedition was the best adventure of the last century. Though Shackleton failed, he saved all his people. Now that I’m nearing 59, I understand that failing is more important than having success. If you look at my life, then one thing is clear. I did one activity at a time, with all my willpower, all my money and all my time. Complete commitment.(Interview by Ed Douglas in The Observer) A Y R A H C A R J A B N I M Messner: “Don’t mess around with Everest.” 30 MAY - 5 JUNE 2003 NEPALI TIMES #147 9 “Nepal needs tourism to survive, and tourism needs local culture and the environment to survive,” Messner said. He lashed out at Kathmandu-centric mass tourism, the corruption and the ecological erosion that has accompanied trekking and mountaineering in some areas. “Mountaineering is much more than Mt Everest, and Nepal is much more than Mt Everest,” he reminded participants. Messner’s formula is a push towards decentralised tourism so that people in hitherto neglected areas can benefit from the jobs and incomes from trekking, especially in western Nepal. “If we don’t do thins, I’m afraid we are looking at a social bomb in Nepal,” he added. Responding, economist Pitamber Sharma said tourism accelerates the process of change, and while this could probably not be stopped there should be attempts to minimise the negative impact on cultures and the environment. “Cultures are not timeless, while they change, our basic values should be maintained,” Sharma said. The concerns voiced at the seminar were not new: the need for equitable and sustainable tourism have been talked about for the past three decades. But the very fact that they had to be reiterated so forcefully during the 50th anniversary of the first ascent of Sagarmatha showed how little has been done. Even so, participants drew attention to the fact that while international media has focussed on trash on Everest, Nepal had several success stories and accomplishments that perhaps had not got as much publicity: the spread of community forestry which has increased forest cover, eco-tourism models like ACAP and Nepal’s national park system. While the Maoists never directly attacked trekkers, tourism was indirectly affected by news of the violence. On the other hand, because the benefits of tourism had not been trickling down to the grassroots it had fuelled frustrations that fed the insurgency. The seminar was organised by the German newspaper, Die Zeit and the Nepali Times at the Dwarikas Hotel. It did not shirk from tackling sensitive issues like the pile-up of expedition excreta on Mt Everest and other mountains. In response to a query about guidelines for defecation at high-altitude, Messner replied: “When you have thousands of people on the mountain like this year, shit piles up. The stuff is deep-frozen, and as it moves down the icefall and the glacier, the melted water could be contaminated.” The solution could be carrying down plastic sacks from toilets for disposal down the valley, or zapping fresh faeces with sunlight in special “solar toilets”. Austrian Everest summiteer, Wolfgang Nairz, appealed for the rapid fusion of the Sagarmatha National Park in Nepal and the Qomolungma Nature Reserve on the Chinese side into a transboundary World Heritage Site. At the moment, only the Nepali side has been declared a heritage site. Bernd Loopow of Die Zeit, Kunda Dixit of Nepali Times, Reinhold Messner and Pitamber Sharma at the seminar, ‘Tourism in Nepal: A Design for the Future’ on Wednesday. M I N B A J R A C H A R Y A The over-commercialisation of Everest came up again, and participants felt the need to balance regulation with the freedom of the mountain. “Everest itself is record in itself, so everyone wants to be the first to do something new,” Messner admitted. Pretty soon, there will be the first ascent of Mt Everest by a man with his dog, and there may be helicopter ascents from base camp to a helipad on the summit with an oxygen pipeline to the south summit. Joking aside, there was a proposal to take on Edmund Hillary’s idea to declare a moratorium on climbing Mt Everest for ten years so the mountain could “clean itself” and get back its aura. But a problem was immediately pointed out: what if Nepal declares a moratorium and China doesn’t. At present, the world’s third highest mountain, Kangchendzonga can be climbed from the Nepali north side, but is banned from the south side in Sikkim. Messner’s own idea was to regulate so that only one expedition be allowed on one route per season. This would ensure income from royalty, while preventing over-crowding. Said Messner: “Everest is a strong mountain. But you have to climb it in a clean way, taking risks and surviving, climbing from base camp to the top along a fixed rope is not climbing. We must let the mountain regain its power.” \u0006 N ow that the festivities to mark the Everest anniversary are finally over, the work to lift living standards of the inhabitants of the Himalaya begins anew, and peace is a pre-requisite. That was the message from the Tyrolean climber Reinhold Messner and other Sagarmatha summiteers, academics and tourism experts at a seminar on Wednesday. Messner, with Peter Habeler, became the first person to climb the mountain without oxygen in 1978, and in 1980 became the first to climb the world’s highest mountain solo (see p8). Messner, who is now a member of the European Parliament and heavily involved in development policy, presented a ‘roadmap’ for Nepal’s progress through tourism: preservation of ethnic diversity, bio-diversity, the environment and spreading the benefits of tourism away from Kathmandu. ANALYSIS 30 MAY - 5 JUNE 2003 NEPALI TIMES #147 by SHLOMO AVINERI The Middle East dream map In reality it is little more than a wish list. WORLD 10 Anti-logging under fire ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ BRUSSELS – The European Commission is coming under fire for its new action plan to combat illegal logging in the developing countries, the largest timber producers in the world. The Action Plan for Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) is designed to curb growing trade in illicit logging and illegally harvested timber in wood-producing countries through a series of preventative measures. Europe’s imports of illegally sourced timber are believed to be worth about $1.4 billion a year. The Commission’s latest proposals aim to combat the trade by helping partner countries to build systems to check that timber has been harvested legally and addressing the problems posed by the use of revenues from illegal logging to fund and prolong armed conflicts. According to a report by the NGO Forests and the European Union Resource Network (FERN), presented to the Commission last year, approximately 50 percent of imports of tropical timber and 20 percent of timber from boreal trees into the EU are illegally sourced. Although FERN welcomes measures to prevent money laundering through illegal logging, it says that the EU must ensure that the practice is included in future reviews of money laundering legislation. (IPS) worse. The Palestinians’ refusal to accept, or even continue to negotiate about, the most generous and comprehensive Israeli offer since l967 in exchange for an end-of-conflict agreement signified that the Palestinians are not ready to accept Israel’s legitimacy. There is now much more bitterness, fear, and hatred on both sides than in 2000, when the Camp David negotiations failed. The direct and indirect support given by the Palestinian Authority to suicide bombing against civilians in Israel suggested to most Israelis that the Palestinians still view attacks against civilians as a legitimate weapon. The sometimes-brutal Israeli responses to such terrorism further embittered the Palestinians against Israel. True, the sidelining of Arafat and the appointment of Abu Mazen as the Palestinian prime minister is an important step in the right direction. But Abu Mazen’s real power has yet to be tested. Does he really control the murky financial resources of the PLO, which gave Arafat so much real power beyond the formal title of head of the Palestinian Authority? Most importantly, does Abu Mazen have the political will and power to really peace with Egypt and Jordan, Israel remains threatened by such countries as Syria and Libya, whose extremist regimes are deeply involved in violent terrorism against civilians in Israel and either possess or try to possess weapons of mass destruction. For this reason, the road map premises peace between Israel and the Palestinians on normalisation of relations between Israel and all Arab countries. Can this really be achieved in the foreseeable future? Does the US—or, for that matter the Quartet— really believe they know how to move Syria or Libya from their current closed-mind position, which threatens Israel’s existence? There is no indication in the road map that the initiators have thought this out beyond wishing out loud that it would happen. Similarly, the road map is an attempt to revive the Oslo peace process. But this process, based in the 1993 Oslo accords between Israel and the PLO, has been in serious trouble since Yasser Arafat rejected the peace package offered to him by Prime Minister Ehud Barak, with the support of President Bill Clinton, at Camp David in December 2000. This was a watershed in Middle East politics—a massive change for the T he recent push given by President George W Bush to the so-called Middle East “road map” is welcome, and the fact that both Israel and the Palestinians have accepted it is a good omen. Yet the chances that it will bring real, as opposed to merely rhetorical, progress toward reconciliation remain slim. The reasons are manifold: first, what is called a “road map” is in reality little more than a wish list of what has to be done in order to achieve peace between Israel and the Palestinians. It is a noble set of goals, but it sometimes appears to be distant from the region’s political realities. For example, the road map rightly acknowledges that the Israeli- Palestinian conflict cannot be solved in a void; regional considerations must be taken into account. The plan calls for far-reaching Israeli concessions: withdrawal from the West Bank and Gaza, dismantling of settlements, some compromise about Jerusalem. At the same time, the “quartet” that composed the road map—the US, the EU, Russia, and the UN—realises that Israel cannot be convinced to make such concessions without a fundamental change in the general attitude of the Arab world to the existence of the Jewish state.

It would need constant follow-up on dozens of contentious points at the highest level, ie the US President. Is President Bush—or any US President—capable of effectively exercising his enormous authority, day in and day out for two or three years, to ensure that the parties really translate what might be just a verbal acceptance of vague language into painful, and even politically dangerous, decisions? Past experience is not encouraging. The attention span of a US President is limited on any issue. Yet without his constant attention, the road map will run into the Middle East sand dunes that have already buried so many well- intentioned peace plans. What, then, can be achieved? Perhaps, as in Bosnia and Kosovo—where nobody talks about a permanent solution, but violence has been stopped—what is needed is stabilisation, an end to daily bloodshed, de-escalation of hostility, and some mutual confidence building. Israelis and Palestinians are not yet ready for the tough political decisions envisaged by the road map. They need a series of stopgap measures to bring stability and safety for civilians on both sides. With such de-escalation, perhaps at some time in the future true reconciliation will be possible. However difficult or sad to admit, the moment is not ripe for more than this. \u0006 (© Project Syndicate) (Shlomo Avineri is professor of political science at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem.)

His statement was a departure from Pakistan’s earlier position that it would freely trade with India only after the resolution of the long-standing dispute over Kashmir. Between them, Pakistan and India trade goods amounting to an average of $250 million annually. Pakistan has not accorded the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) status to India and allows trade in just 600 items from its eastern neighbour. But Prime Minister Zafarullah Jamali has allowed the importation of 78 more items after the recent thaw in the relations with India. Officials at the Islamabad Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ICCI) said the Indo-Pakistan Chamber of Commerce and Industry has contacted them to nominate members of a delegation due to travel to India in June. (IPS) greatly exacerbating poverty, at least in the short run—which is the longest period the world’s poor can afford to care about. Critics point to the string of economic crises in Africa, Asia, and Latin America in recent years, often attributing them to multilateral lenders’ demands for full liberalisation of foreign trade and capital flows, privatisation and fiscal austerity. But the debate often overlooks an increasingly important feature: the many millions of migrants who send money home. Data on families in developing countries that receive money from relatives working abroad directly demonstrate that at least one element of globalisation—migration—increases economic stability in poor countries. Migrants from struggling countries in Latin America, Southeast Asia and other regions are increasingly securing jobs at wages that, while low by rich country standards, are far higher than they could dream of back home. In 2001, workers from low- and middle- income countries sent home a staggering $43 billion—more than double the level of a decade earlier and $5 billion more than that year’s total official foreign aid to these countries. Whatever the reason for sending money home, these so-called “remittances”— the cash workers send home to countries like Colombia, Haiti, Jamaica, Mexico and Bangladesh—act as a safety net that their governments typically need but cannot afford to provide. In small, developing economies incomes are often considerably more volatile, owing to heavy reliance on a few commodities or industries and COMMENT hence higher vulnerability to external shocks, including weather-related and other natural disasters. Indeed, poor countries also often lack the private insurance needed to offer emergency assistance. In developing countries, remittances from workers abroad amount to the best insurance around. In addition to providing their families at home with a much-needed source of stable income, expatriate migrant workers send home even more money when catastrophe strikes. Such remittances enabled thousands of Jamaicans, for example, to recover from the devastation of Hurricane Gilbert in 1988, when storm damage was estimated at more than one-quarter of the country’s annual GDP and nearly three households in four reported damage. The same was true when Argentina’s economy collapsed last year, when violence wracked Haiti and a hurricane ravaged Honduras before that, and whenever floods submerge villages in Bangladesh. In case after case, billions of dollars in remittances from migrants have given families in poor countries what their governments (and foreign donors) could not always provide: food, safety, the resources to recover and hope. The importance of remittances to households in poor countries, especially during periods of external shock, holds two lessons. First, it should be easy and inexpensive for migrants to send money home. Today, migrants and their families often pay 10 percent or more of the remittances in fees to financial institutions that transfer funds and exchange currencies. Reducing these fees would, in effect, be a tax cut for the world’s poorest. Second, and perhaps more importantly, we should embrace migration as a proven method of bringing immediate relief and stability to poor nations. Given that family members are the best judge of need, migration and remittances may, in fact, constitute a foreign-aid framework that is better targeted and more effective than any government program can ever be. \u0006 (© Project Syndicate) (Scott Wallsten is a Fellow at the AEI-Brookings Joint Centre for Regulatory Studies and a Resident Scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.) by PRAFUL BIDWAI The ‘anti-terrorism’ tango India and Israel, for decades on opposing sides of the fight for Palestinian statehood, are set to become close strategic allies. f the Indian government, led by the ultra-conservative Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), has its way, the two states would join the United States in forming “the core” of an all-new, unique, ‘democratic’ alliance to fight ‘international I terrorism’. To this end, New Delhi has invited Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon on an official visit in the second week of June. However, it is by no means certain that either a Sharon visit or the US-India-Israel anti-terrorism ‘axis’ will materialise anytime soon. There are too many likely impediments to the formation of the proposed triangular alliance, including the US’ reluctance to antagonise other allies, including Pakistan and the Arab states. Above all, there is likely to be stiff popular resistance within India to any strategic axis that centrally involves Israel. The US-India-Israel axis was proposed by India’s national security adviser Brajesh Mishra (seen in pic, above, with Donald Rumsfeld, 2001) in Washington on 8 May. Significantly, Mishra was addressing the annual meeting of the American Jewish Committee (AJC), a Zionist group considered the single most powerful lobby in the US. White House chief of staff Andrew Card also addressed the meeting. Among the audience were several US congressmen and Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar. Mishra outlined his proposal while lavishing praise upon the AJC and “celebrating” the “alliance of free societies” in combating global terrorism. He said, “The US, India and Israel face the same ugly face of modern-day terrorism’’. Mishra urged the three should form the core of a ‘democratic’ alliance, which would have “the political will and moral authority to take bold decisions”, adding it has a “natural logic”. Mishra’s proposal is the culmination of growing political- military contacts between India and Israel since full-scale diplomatic relations were established in 1992. India is now one of the world’s biggest buyers of Israeli weapons. The ‘axis’ proposal represents a new kind of India-Israel intimacy based on a certain notion of “terrorism” that is a major break from India’s full-throated support for numerous Non-Aligned Movement resolutions expressing solidarity with the Palestinian cause. New Delhi’s motives in building a special strategic alliance with Israel are threefold. First, it wants to marginalise Pakistan and offer itself as an especially important ally of the US by endearing itself to Washington’s pro-Likud Zionist lobby. The ‘axis’ could help India claim pre-eminence in the US scheme of things for South Asia and reap potential benefits as the United States’ junior partner, especially in the ‘war on terror’. Second, the ‘special alliance’ will help the Hindu-sectarian BJP in further polarising Indian society along religious lines. So far, the Palestinian cause has attracted broad-based secular support in India. But after the war on Iraq, many Muslims feel alienated and discriminated against. Right-wing Hindu extremists allied to the BJP revel in this, some supported the Iraq war, which polls show that over 85 percent of Indians opposed. An India-Israel alliance will probably widen the gap—to the BJP’s political advantage. Third, the BJP is genuinely fascinated by the highly militarised nature of Israeli society and its state’s willingness to use massive force against the Palestinians, and by the jingoism and machismo of Likudists like Sharon. Some BJP leaders have the same contempt and hatred for India’s religious minorities as Sharon has for the Palestinian people. This was in evidence last year in Gujarat, where 2,000 Muslims were massacred in a pogrom. Some Hindu ideologues are also driven by Islamophobia to posit a historic ‘civilisational’ alliance between Hinduism and the Judeo-Christian tradition against Islam. The ‘axis’ has dire implications not just for India’s foreign policy, but for its domestic politics too. Besides globally aligning India with conservative and ethically indefensible forces, a special alliance with Israel will be a blow to secularism and pluralism domestically. The ray of hope is that this will be resolutely opposed by the Indian public. \u0006 (IPS) (Praful Bidwai is a New Delhi-based columnist and an author of several books.) THIS PAGE CONTAINS MATERIAL SELECTED FROM THE NEPALI PRESS FROM THE NEPALI PRESS 12 The way things are Binaya Kasajoo in Budhabar, 28 May We could soon have three parallel governments in Nepal—one installed by the palace, one by the Maoists and now, another convened by the major political parties to represent the dissolved parliament. The first two are backed by military power, while the third enjoys the support of the public and democratic forces. On 28 May, the people’s representatives sat at a meeting to decide on how best to resuscitate the parliament. The Nepali Congress (D), Sher Bahadur Deuba’s party that was conspicuous in its absence, could be held responsible for the current tangle. It encouraged regression that led to the October Fourth move which allowed the palace to step in. Given the unpopularity of the NC(D), it isn’t strange that its prominent members are abandoning the party like rats from a sinking ship. In the meantime, public curiosity and exultation surrounding the emergence of the Maoist leaders is slowly waning. It’s possible the rebel leaders themselves are feeling the change in momentum. Even the media no longer considers them very newsworthy. The unfolding national situation shows us one thing: politics is volatile and hostilities extend from schools to the parliament. Despite the rhetoric about multiparty democracy and constitutional monarchy, the Panchas of pre-democracy have been standing in the wings ever since the royal move. King Gyanendra’s interference surely could not have come as a surprise to the political parties who profess experience and dedication to democracy. The least they can be accused of is turning a blind eye, thereby failing to act promptly. The haste with which Deuba evacuated his official Prime Ministerial residence after being summarily sacked by the king is an indication of the little faith he had in the people to reclaim their sovereignty— either by keeping him there or ousting him out themselves. If Taranath Ranabhat had any allegiance to multiparty democracy he would not have mocked the system by accepting official invitations as Speaker of the defunct House of Representatives. The fact that the agitating political parties have now turned to him for legitimacy is illogical. The Chand government, limited to Singha Darbar, has become harsher towards the political parties while offering the Maoists more flexibility. Both workers and leaders have quite literally been battered since 4 May. Where this road will lead is anybody’s guess. As things stand, there is little reason to hope for a positive outcome. The people should be the decisive power, but after years of disappointment in the system and demoralised by the conflict, they will need a major catalyst to stir them into reclaiming what is rightfully theirs. A Y R A H C A R J A B N I M The refugee deal Deshantar, 25 May ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ The 14th round of ministerial level talks between Nepal and Bhutan regarding the repatriation of refugees not only puts a stop to the possibility of Bhutanese nationals going home, but also raises questions about Nepal’s integrity. The Nepali government granted the Bhutanese discretion in choosing who it would accept and simultaneously accepted diplomatic defeat by agreeing to grant Nepali citizenship to those unwilling to return to Bhutan. “The negotiations were compromised by the lack of an elected democratic Nepali government,” says former foreign minister Ram Sharan Mahat. International lobbying and persistent demands from the refugees pressured Bhutan into conceding even these partial gains. Refugee leaders say the Druk government will try to prove a majority of the refugees are non- Bhutanese, in compliance with the parameters set by the joint verification. “If Nepal doesn’t promptly amend this blunder, it will soon have to welcome Indians of Nepali origin with open arms,” says Mahat. He advised Nepal to seek the involvement of the United Nations and international human rights groups in monitoring the repatriation process. Refugee leader Ratan Gazmere accused Nepal of violating international laws by agreeing to grant Nepali citizenships to Bhutanese refugees unwilling to return home. He said this would reduce them to mere squatters on Nepali soil. “It is a gross injustice to the Bhutanese refugees,” he said. The refugees are also discontented about Nepal’s agreement to imprison and try those who are categorised as criminals. Gazmere said his group will take the matter to court because the Bhutanese government has categorically labelled political and human rights activists as 30 MAY - 5 JUNE 2003 NEPALI TIMES #147 criminals. He also expressed concern over where the refugees would be resettled when they are allowed back into Bhutan. Most of their houses were demolished and their lands were resettled with people from northern Bhutan. People power Chhalphal, 25 May ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ One point for the little guys! Public pressure and protests led the Madhyapur Thimi Municipality to reverse its decision on granting forest land to the Armed Police Force. When the local community forestry group learnt the forest they stewarded was being granted to the police force they decided not to accept it. In the absence of elected representatives, the municipality made its decision on the basis of direct instruction from Bhaktapur District Administration Office without consulting the locals, the political parties and civil society. Even the ward office and forestry users group were left in the dark. While this clearly demonstrates bureaucratic abuse of authority, it also illustrates that real people power is far from defunct. Not that victory came easily. For two consecutive days the people sat in protest and gheraoed the municipality office. The chief of the municipality office, Pashupati Pokharel, had to publicly apologise to calm the crowd down. A delegation, led by local political activists, visited the chief district officer Geha Nath Bhandari and handed over a memorandum that warned they would be keeping an eye on the future misuse of public property. On hold Spacetime, 28 May ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ Uncertainty looms large over the Integrated Security and Development Program (ISDP) in Gorkha launched by the government two years ago that hoped to develop Gorkha as a ‘model district’. The peace and development package is gathering dust thanks to the Finance Ministry not releasing funds on time. In the initial program seven districts were selected, but the government backtracked and decided solely on Gorkha. Although Rs 3.6 million was set aside from the budget during the current fiscal year, the bureaucracy seemed to deliberately drag its heels and is now involved in discussing the next national budget. It was estimated that the district needed Rs 15 million this year to effectively implement the program. Out of the allocated amount, Rs 2 million was set aside for the Nageshwor-Nigel road, Rs 1 million for the Ghyampesal- Tarkukot road and Rs 700 thousand to build the road between Chorkate and Chitre. The district monitoring committee formed under the chairmanship of the local development officer has not met in a year. The newly appointed district security chief Col Prakash Kumar KC requested a meeting, but the LDO refused to convene until the funds are released. Gopi Koirala of the DDC said the budget was delayed in last year too. The government finally granted Rs 8 million to which the DMC contributed Rs 5 million, enabling the completion of construction work worth Rs 13 million. Madhav Prasad Ojha, chief district officer and member of the DMC, revealed work had been hampered when even the DMC delayed payments. The lack of peace and security, especially in northern Gorkha has added to problems. “The security situation and negligence from the centre is killing the very concept of developing Gorkha as a model district,” says Ojha. NGOs have long deserted the area after law and order deteriorated. The ISDP was the government’s attempt at filling the void left by the NGOs that bailed out.

Kantipur, 19 May By Guna Raj Luitel and Bed Raj Paudel With the security forces restricted to district headquarters, the Maoists had a free reign in mobilising and absorbing communities. With remarkable efficiency they are fitting themselves into the very fabric of normalcy in rural areas. Their latest venture puts even the administration under their control. In Bhojpur the Maoists are determined to make clear who is in charge: they have rapidly renamed VDCs ‘Village People’s Committees’. Many VDC signboards have been changed. The elected positions that fell vacant after the suspension of the local government are also being filled by former office holders instated by the rebels, among them former Bhojpur VDC chairman Durga Ale and two others in Tiwari Bhanjyang and Chyangre. A school teacher from Yangpang village, a day’s walk from Bhojpur Bazar, told us that the name of VDC offices and reinstatement of officials took place at a mass meeting organised by the Maoists. Villages are painted with Maoist slogans, flags and banners. The latter demand the election of a constituent assembly and an interim government. The presence the Kirat Workers’ Party (KWP), close allies of the Maoists, is also visible. The KWP banners ask for an autonomous state. Another popular call is for a full investigation into the death of Krishna Sen. The Maoists are trying to win the hearts and minds of the people by creating a semblance of stability. They did not have a very strong hold of the east during the seven-year insurgency, and the ceasefire has given them a chance to consolidate their political presence in these areas. The absence of the police after their posts were removed has only made their campaign smoother. The workers of the mainstream political parties are limiting themselves to district headquarters leaving the field open to the Maoists who are slowly gaining a monopoly over the villages. “Who would risk opposing the Maoists?” asks a farmer in Gogane, a five-hour walk from district headquarters. “Everyone does what they want.” He told us the rebels have even begun to help in the fields. The question is what will we harvest from what the Maoists have sown? “Dear me! The parties announced in jest that they were going to form a government and he has already begun to iron his outfit!” GP Koirala: “Sherpa bhai, won’t you give us some tips on how we can take our campaign to the top too?” Gorkhapatra, 26 May Nepal Samacharpatra, 28 May HISTORY AND CULTURE 30 MAY - 5 JUNE 2003 NEPALI TIMES #147 13 Back at Sundarijal >36 “The king needs to balance.” 3 April, 1977 Sundarijal 4 April Sundarijal Perhaps there is a great mental strain of which I am not aware, but which is insidiously affecting my mental and physical capabilities. Today at about 2PM the vision in my left eye became suddenly dimmed at its upper left corner. It lasted for about 10 minutes and I became very, very anxious. My anxiety is all the greater because can’t get the help of a doctor at short notice— moreover the officer in charge of the camp enters the jail only 3 times a day—8AM, 12 noon and 7PM. If anything happens during the intervening hours or at night there is no help. When GM was here I had some confidence and we have mutually arranged that our rooms at night wouldn’t be bolted from inside in case of need. Perhaps I need to change my spectacles because the ones that I am using aren’t giving me efficient service. But this sudden clouding of my vision in the portion of the left eye which lasted for some minutes only couldn’t be due to deterioration of my eyesight. The symptoms may also have been induced by Isopterin, the medicine to correct my heart beat—extra systole or whatever it is. I did some reading in the morning and did some writing also— ie did some useful work. But I am mentally unsettled, fidgety, alternating between buoyancy and depression. I read the papers minutely—4 issues, 2 each of Gorkhapatra and Rising Nepal— nothing of importance. My mind is not very active—perhaps this is how nature helps, a kind of survival strategy to put your energy to the minimum use, to keep you alive by slowing down your tempo. I have become very forgetful also. But I feel there are temporary disabilities produced by the unnatural conditions of detention. No serious damage is occurring either to my physical or mental health—the damage temporarily sustained could be correction in normal conditions. Since four days we got rain almost every day, hence the weather has become cool. The sky is cloudy. I have put all my warm clothes away in mothballs. I need a light quilt at night, having discarded the second one. In the day I use a khasto given to me by Santosh. It is a beautiful khasto and it is giving me a very necessary service. I am usually in khasto pajama and kurta, which was…for me by Sushila in December 1968 in B’bay. Sometime I don dhaka cap—a concession to the spirit of Nepalism. Peculiar unusual weather has developed for the last one week, the weather is like that of a rainy season. It has been raining intermittently accompanied by strong wind and occasional bouts of sunshine. The sky is mostly cloudy and the mornings are foggy. Such weather is not propitious for mental tranquility. Clouds are mentally very exciting and emotionally disturbing. I can now understand the banished … homesickness at the sight of the first cloud of rains. Kalidas has composed what I think to be his best piece of poetry incorporating a lover’s sentiment at the sight of a moving cloud. I am homesick again. But the homesickness is not as anguishing as it used to be in the beginning—but it is homesickness alright—a mild sadness, a desire to look at Sushila’s picture again and again, revival of the memory of Shailaja’s and other dear ones again and again—a pang, sense of deprivation, a poignant need for emotional company. Dil chahata hai phir wahi phursat ke raat din, baithe rahe to sabse jawa kiye huye. Did a spot of writing on the history of the Nepali Congress. I am currently at the period of 1947 when mother used to be very active in politics, which resulted in her arrest during the mill women’s strike. I am full of mother today. Tarini was one of us to be arrested during that struggle. As a matter of fact, he was the first one to be arrested on that date. He is also no more. We have travelled a long way from those days. As I write about that period I remember mother and Tarini’s role during the initial days of our struggle vividly. Others are living but they are no more. Bal Chandra Sharma was also active in those days, but he became a treacherous renegade to the cause, hence his memory doesn’t evoke any emotion in me. In the evening when I am alone I think of mother. I gaze at the darkening shadows of the kapur tree and foolishly—superstitiously—fervently hope that mother would emerge from darkness. She had whispered a diksha mantra into my ears when I was a child. I suddenly remember that mantra and repeat it many times over, holding a lock of her hair, which I have brought with me, in my hand expecting ardently that she would listen wherever she is and make if only fleeting appearance before me. It is all foolishness but I am assailed by her memory deeply, profoundly. Today’s Gorkhapatra and Rising Nepal is full of the king’s return to Kathmandu from India yesterday and of his great doings in India. He is depicted as a great emperor to whom the leaders of India pay homage. I hope the king, impressionable as he is, will keep his balance and will not equate courtiers’ flattery with truth. BP Koirala is obsessed with his health, and every little ailment worries him. He is also travelling down memory lane, remembering his mother fondly and chanting the mantra that she gave him before she died. BP also confesses that he is homesick for the company of his wife and niece Shailaja. Reading the Rising Nepal’s coverage of King Birendra’s return from India, he hopes the monarch is not swayed by the flattery of his courtiers. Kathmandu’s street cattle M ahamtma Gandhi once said, “The greatness of a nation and its moral progress can be judged by the way its animals are treated.” By that yardstick, Nepal PETRA THAGUNNA and LUCIA DE VRIES ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ May Lord Pashupatinath have mercy on the holy cows of Kathmandu. lags behind in greatness. In fact, there is almost a total absence of animal welfare in the country. The worst problem is that of wandering cattle injured in road accidents in Kathmandu’s streets. For all the reverence, the fate of a fatally injured cow is unholy. Laxmi is a kind-hearted cow found outside Pashupatinath two years ago. It took volunteers from the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Nepal (SPCAN) a few hours to gently direct the limping cow to the shelter. Here it was found that not only did she suffer from a spinal injury, probably after being hit by a bus or truck, but also that she was four months pregnant. Despite her precarious situation, Laxmi gave birth to a beautiful, healthy calf, Kamdhenu. After the delivery, Laxmi’s health deteriorated rapidly. Although she was still eating, she could no longer get up. This meant that the staff, with the help of kind neighbours, had to push her up every three hours, or lift her into a makeshift harness. Her pain became more and more obvious. SPCAN volunteers pleaded for euthanasia, but the management felt that with the laws of the land (the penalty for killing a cow is Rs 20,000 or two years imprisonment) this would not be desirable. Laxmi, after a painfully slow and cruel death bed, finally passed away in April. Although traffic accidents are the main reason for injuries, there are many cases of cruelty inflicted by children or shopkeepers. SPCAN last year received six cases of spinal injuries, both cattle and dogs. A remarkably bright dog named Baby Bear survived, but will be paralysed from the waist downwards. The intensive care of these animals places huge demands on many of SPCAN’s limited resources. The holy cows of Kathmandu, once a tourist novelty and integral part of a tight-knit, gently moving society, have become a nuisance for motorists and an embarrassment for the authorities. Nepal’s national animal is traditionally a symbol of prosperity, but now are abandoned to roam homelessly on the streets. Clockwise from bottom l-r: An ox suffering from a spinal injury at the SPCAN shelter, Laxmi’s calf Kamdhenu lives on, a malnourished calf found in Kalanki vegetable market on its way to Karuna Rescue & Recovery Centre. Until a few years ago one could find aging resident bulls in places like New Road, Durbar Marg and Baneshwor. During the last SAARC Summit the familiar Nandi of Naxal, together with a number of stray cows, disappeared and they have not been heard of since. But young calves and mature cows are still common at traffic intersections, standing by the side or in the middle of the road. Or they are at the garbage dumps, rummaging through plastic and organics in search of food. Often not fully weaned, the young calves suffer the most, many do not survive. Most bulls are abandoned by their owners because they are of little economic value in a valley where they cannot be used for ploughing. Cows are abandoned from private homes and dairies when the owners face a lack of space or fodder, or when they no longer give milk. It is said that owners from farming communities such as Bhaktapur and Godavari drive cows into the city at night and abandon them. The priests of Pashupatinath, as part of new moon and full moon rituals, continue to release a bull-calf twice a month. Most calves however return quickly, after all, Pashupati has become an ideal dumping ground for the city’s unwanted, sick or in jured animals. The conflicting duality of religious and cultural notions on one hand and modernisation of the city on the other is increasing, and stray cows are among the most visible victims of this conflict. Stray cattle are randomly picked up by the traffic police (which is why animal activists dread any international visit or meeting held in Kathmandu) to be released outside the valley. Cows from Eastern Nepal are being sold in Damak and transported to slaughterhouses across the border. At SPCAN, staff have learned how to make the lives of injured cows as comfortable as possible. Its gaushala of Siphal is a beginning, but the problem is too vast. The municipalities of Kathmandu and Patan have to come up with a management plan for stray cattle with rehab for injured cows, animal birth control and a shelter for unweaned, sick and aging cattle. Temporary solutions could include proper registration and monitoring of the cattle population, mobile veterinary services and feeding sites in a number of locations (set up with the involvement of communities, hotels and restaurants willing to donate their vegetarian left-overs). The actions must be backed by the central government, by introducing supportive animal welfare legislation and monitoring systems, possibly including a policy on humane medical intervention for dying cows. Unitll then, may Lord Pashupatinath have mercy on the holy cows of Kathmandu. \u0006 (Petra Thagunna & Lucia de Vries are affiliated with SPCA Nepal.

This has sent temperature soaring to the mid-forties in the tarai. The searing heat is necessary to suck in the monsoon moisture, but there are no signs yet of this happening. But this time there should have been monsoon troughs forming off the Kerala and Sri Lanka coasts as well as in the Bay of Bengal near Bangladesh. Maybe next week. But till then, expect a dry and hot spell. Even so, May has been a wet pre-monsoon with above normal rainfall.

Monsoon in Kathmandu: it’s hitting 30 degrees and the air is so thick you can slice it with a cocktail stirrer. The most effort one can muster is to signal a passing waiter that you need a refill. Nepali Times takes the legwork out of bar-hopping by offering you a comprehensive guide to the best monsoon watering holes in the Valley. Chin chin. ALL ROADS LEAD TO THAMEL The brightly lit heartland of tourist tack offers a bonanza of bars for a casual night out that’s easy on the wallet. Past the main chowk, into one of the narrow alleys and up one flight of Maya Cocktail Maya Cocktail narrow stairs is Maya Cocktail Maya Cocktail Maya Cocktail BarBarBarBarBar—a little piece of Mexico that does not make idle boasts of mixing the best cocktails in town. Get in between 4- 10PM, a generously long Happy Hour, and you’ll score a free drink for every one you order. Maya has genuine Mexican tequila, the worm is optional. Knock back enough of those and you may find yourself on a Tijuana-bound flight. Just around the corner warm candlelight bathes wreaths of corn and chili on adobe walls and rough furniture at the Roadhouse Café. For the slightly more upscale hombre, the bartender rustles up the best daquiris and martinis. They have a decent wine list—guaranteed nothing from those icky cardboard ‘casks’—liqueurs, draft beer, cocktails and the rest of the usual suspects. Excellent nibbles too. The satay, humous and woodfired pizzas are divine. An illuminated blackboard on a Thamel street says “Tom and Jerry Pub two flights up”, not that the regulars need directions. An old favorite where travellers and locals mingle, the pub is never empty. In the tradition set by Rum Doodle, many a visitor has felt compelled to leave a souvenir at Tom and Jerry. Some return to reminisce over extra stout Guiness or a special creamy cocktail. Far from the well-trodden path of Lonely Planet toters, Sam’s Bar is the sort of place you stumble upon and want to keep among a select few. It’s casual, laid back and has enough (nice) graffiti on the walls to fill a book. Saturday evenings is Reggae Night—Bob Marley and Peter Tosh all washed down with whatever is your pleasure. The terrace tables, shrouded by young bamboo, are highly coveted and if it rains you needn’t relocate thanks to a spanking new retractable roof. Then, there is the legendary Rum Doodle, the highest-located bar situated at 40,000½ft. It recently 30 MAY - 5 JUNE 2003 NEPALI TIMES #147 15 Behind Hot days. Humid nights. Long, cold drinks.

LAZIMPAT Just a stone’s throw from Thamel but a world away in ambience is the original Lodging Part. If you’re looking to jazz up your evening, make your way to this street where a bouquet of bars could be just the thing. The new avatar of the Jazz Bar in Shangri-la Hotel, scheduled to reopen in the first week of June, will be known as Not Just the Jazz Bar and they’re flying in international artists who will perform jazz combos, modern pop and blues. On alternate Friday nights come salsa with Kathmandu’s resident salsero, Diego Saenz. Oh, yes, all drinks half price in June. Upstairs Jazz Bar is home to Nepal’s hottest contribution to the world of jazz. On Wednesday and Saturday nights Cadenza’s music flows into the sidewalks below.

Fittingly, it hosted a big dinner for the who’s who of mountaineering on 27 May as part of the Everest Jubilee Celebrations. Tall tales abound. Another noteworthy tavern is Tantra in Jyatha. Its intimate ambience makes it very appropriate for a little down time. The fusion menu is a delight and the new cocktails are fast becoming the toast of the town.

In its four years of operation it has earned a reputation as one of Kathmandu’s best bars. The wine list has an array that spans whole continents and features more than 150 cocktails. The bar gets its name from the traditional red onion trade between Nepal, Tibet and India, and displays a scooter that was used to ferry onions 80 years ago. The regular clientele is a sober crowd from business houses, banks, development agencies, embassies and the like. They let their hair down on Wednesday and Saturday nights when live bands introduce a little shake, rattle and roll. Just next door at the Radisson is the six-storey-high Splash Bar & Grill with great sunset views and the Lazimpat forest. It is gaining a Friday following with a live band, innovative drinks and their Cajun Chicken Salad. HIGH END No bar crawl would be complete without dropping into the Rox Bar at Hyatt Regency. The trendiest bar in town, on weekends the blond wood and marble floor is teeming with life from wall to granite studded wall. Drinks and food are on the pricey side but that’s only to be expected because this is where Kathmandu comes to see and be seen—and don’t mind paying for it either. The Friday nights cover charge alone is Rs 300 for ladies and Rs 500 for gentlemen. The Rox has a dress code too so make sure you don’t rock up in your chappals. If an evening among sophisticates is what you desire then look no further than the Piano Lounge Bar at the Yak & Yeti Hotel. The resident in-house Irish band An Fainne is the perfect accompaniment to comparing the merits of perhaps the largest collection of single malts in the kingdom.

Out of danger A rescue group in Khumbu is saving the lives of trekking porters. ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ WANDA VIVEQUIN from GOKYO G okyo Valley is achingly beautiful with astounding views of Sagarmatha from Gokyo Ri. Lok Bahadur Karki, a porter with a Kathmandu-based trekking company, was with a group heading that way to an area locals refer to as “death valley”. Before dawn one morning, Lok was found unconscious in his tent at the Renjo La base camp, at 5,000m. Hastily, the other porters put him in a doko to carry him lower down to Gokyo. Although it was still dark when they got there, the porters decided to push for Machermo where they knew the International Porter Protection Group (IPPG) had recently established a rescue post for porters. Day dawned, lighting a path that was treacherous with ice and sleet. Somewhere between Gokyo and Machermo the porter carrying Lok lost his foothold and fell. Lok sustained a head injury, worsening his already unstable medical condition. Knowing medical help was not far away, a few porters ran ahead to Machermo to alert the medical staff. Within the hour, the medical team raced back up the valley to assist the seriously ill porter. Working to stabilise his neck, the doctors fashioned a makeshift stretcher (pic, right). It took four hours to ready Lok for evacuation back down to Machermo. More than 24 hours had passed since Lok had lost consciousness. All through the night the clinic’s volunteer doctors worked hard to keep him alive, administering intravenous fluids and antibiotics, and treating him in the portable altitude chamber (PAC). Meanwhile one of the clinic’s volunteers sprinted down to Kunde Hospital, making the six-hour trip in half of that time. At 3AM Dr Simon Pulfrey from the hospital and Bill Brewster started for Machermo with a stretcher and extra medical equipment. A team of eight porters, many of whom had already worked a full day, volunteered to carry their seriously ill colleague back down to Kunde. Without the excellent medical care he received in the Khumbu at Machermo and Kunde, Lok would have died. Despite a fractured neck and head injuries, the joint efforts of the staff at these Khumbu clinics and the neurosurgical team at the Teaching Hospital (pic, below) saved the life of this young man. On his way by helicopter to Kathmandu he remained unconscious and the prognosis didn’t look good. But now he has been discharged from hospital and although he faces a long rehabilitation, the neurosurgeons are cautiously optimistic that he will make a full recovery with time. The Machermo Porter Rescue post, which will close at the end of the spring trekking season, is the latest initiative of the IPPG which helps trekking porters. The Machermo post is staffed by a series of western doctors during the season and a trained paid Nepali worker. CIWEC clinic doctor Trish Batchelor, and volunteer doctor, Hillary Liss, who were instrumental in getting the aid post set up, said during the first three weeks of operation, staff saw 63 patients. Thirty-six were porters, 10 were locals and the rest were trekkers and a guide. “All the porters were shocked, surprised and then delighted that the treatment was free,” recalls Batchelor. She said cases ranged from life threatening altitude illness to pneumonia, measles and more common ailments such as viral illnesses, diarrhoea, dehydration, blisters and muscular injuries. “Like all projects of this nature there are some things we desperately need for the future,” she added. This includes an oxygen concentrator that can run on solar power and a satellite phone to organise evacuations and relieve the pressure of getting to Kunde Hospital where there are more extensive medical facilities. Every year an average of two porters died needlessly in the “death valley” from altitude related illnesses. Twelve months ago Lok Bahadur would have been just another statistic. But his survival is a symbol of the determination of his fellow porters and the rescue post at Machermo. No porter should have to face death to give Western trekkers the holiday of a lifetime. \u0006 (Wanda Vivequin is a Canada- based IPPG volunteer.) Altitude Sickness The misconception that physical fitness and youth are shields against this indiscriminate illness is a popular and dangerous one. Young and feeble, old and fit, all are susceptible to altitude related illnesses. A previous healthy experience at high altitude can mean little, while preexisting ailments and illnesses do not preclude mountain sickness. To be sure, there are risk factors involved: rapid ascent, the actual altitude gained, altitude at which you sleep and individual susceptibility. Though the precise causes of mountain sickness continue to elude us, simple treatment is often critical: cease and stop climbing, and descend if symptoms do not ease or rather exacerbate after 24 hours. If resorting to medication, acetazolamide, known to us as Diamox, effectively reduces symptoms of AMS. Prevention is certainly better than cure. Acclimatisation is the natural and gradual regulation by the body to cope with altitude but is a random process varying from person to person. To get the required amount of oxygen at higher altitude our heart and lungs must work harder. At 5000m they are working twice as hard as they would at sea level. Allowing the body to acclimatise over the first 1-3 days at a particular altitude requires a flexible itinerary and is worth the while. Diamox is also used to prevent mountain sickness. 18 Under My Hat by Kunda Dixit Global Summit of Rogues H 24 May, 2004 Delegates Arrive aving notched up a few more points in the Transparency International Corruption Index (even overtaking pros such as Burkina Faso and Guinea Bissau) Nepal has won the bid to host the next Global Conference on Graft, it has been reliably learnt. This is indeed great recognition, since some of the world’s most renowned rascals will be here to deliberate for three days on how to swindle more efficiently, as well as to put finishing touches on the Universal Declaration on Plunder and State Capture. Not only will the conference put Nepal firmly on the world corruption map, it will also boost our convention industry at a time when tourism is going through a bit of a slump. At press time, according to the conference secretariat, more than 1,000 internationally-acclaimed thieves and knaves have confirmed participation, and they include legendary biggies such as Idi Amin and Emperor Bokassa as keynote speakers. Some other up-and-coming Big Names from a certain neighbouring country have said they’ll attend, but are known to be still trying to bribe the organisers so they don’t have to pay the $1,000 registration fee. “Under the table negotiations are on-going,” whispered one staffer.. Meanwhile, the ex-Minister of Injustice and Malfeasance in the 1997 coalition government, as chairman of the Main Organising Committee of the Kathmandu Summit of Rogues, is trying its best to use the occasion to showcase the great strides Nepal has taken since democracy was restored in 1990 to make corruption a way of life. “Earlier only a few people used to be corrupt, but in the past 12 years we have democratised corruption. Now, everyone is corrupt,” the ex- minister boasted after pocketing a baksheesh we had to slip him in exchange for that on-the-record quote. However, he added, there is no room for competency. With the dissolution of parliament there is real danger that corruption will once more be centralised, and that is why we have to fight that tooth-and-nail by burning tyres on the streets and stoning cars to regain our freedom of embezzlement. Meanwhile, a draft agenda for the Kathmandu Summit of the World’s Top Scoundrels has just been released which looks like this: Many will sneak in without paying visa fees while others will smuggle vast quantities of contraband by evading customs. This is standard operating procedure at such Summits. Opening Plenary Welcome Remarks by Nepali ex-Minister, broadcast live to the BICC from his jail cell.

He says Silsila, his fourth album, is symbolic of his commitment to music and appreciation for his listeners. The eight songs are an eclectic blend of Nepali folk, classical and an experimental fusion of oriental melodies with western symphonies. When Robin recorded his first song in 1977 he instantly became the blue-eyed boy of music lovers. Despite winning various awards, he had to struggle for more than five years before he hit the mainstream. Till 1990 Robin was constantly in the public eye till he took a seven-year hiatus. He made his comeback with Sungava in 1997, which in his own words, “was not a commercial success, but it brought me back to my native element of music. It helped me rebuild ties with the music circle.” Robin enjoys an equally successful parallel career as a broadcaster with Radio Nepal where he is the deputy executive director. He joined the staterun service more than two decades ago as a newscaster fresh out of university with an MA in English literature. A pioneer of the country’s first FM channel, Radio Nepal FM,in 1995, Robin is disappointed by the increase of irresponsible broadcasting. “They forgot their primary responsibility towards educating listeners,” he says. At 43 Robin’s music reflects a new maturity. He is particular about what he sings and records, preferring to “play with lyrics” before he makes an artistic commitment to it. “A lyric has to strike some chord with my life for me to feel comfortable singing it,” he says. While working on Silsila, he strove to make sure they also represented the current trends in music. As a result, the album features collaborations with eight lyricists and seven music directors. So, what does the future hold? “Music is something I’ll be doing for a long time to come, so perhaps another album to mark my next 25 years in the field!” Says the veteran singer. \u0006 500 ml CDO Regd No. 194/056/57 Lalitpur, Central Region Postal Regd. No. 04/058/59 ", "", "", "Get this book in print For more than a century, climbers from around the world have journeyed to test themselves on Everest's treacherous slopes, enlisting the expert aid of the Sherpas who live in the area. Drawing on years of field research in the Himalayas, renowned anthropologist Sherry Ortner presents a compelling account of the evolving relationship between the mountaineers and the Sherpas, a relationship of mutual dependence and cultural conflict played out in an environment of mortal risk.Ortner explores this relationship partly through gripping accounts of expeditions -- often in the climbers' own words -- ranging from nineteenth-century forays by the British through the historic ascent of Hillary and Tenzing to the disasters described in Jon Krakauer's Into Thin Air. She reveals the climbers, or \"sahibs\", to use the Sherpas' phrase, as countercultural romantics, seeking to transcend the vulgarity and materialism of modernity through the rigor and beauty of mountaineering. She shows how climbers' behavior toward the Sherpas has ranged from kindness to cruelty, from cultural sensitivity to derision. Ortner traces the political and economic factors that led the Sherpas to join expeditions andexamines the impact of climbing on their traditional culture, religion, and identity. She examines Sherpas' attitudes toward death, the implications of the shared masculinity of Sherpas and sahibs, and the relationship between Sherpas and the increasing number of women climbers. Ortner also tackles debates about whether the Sherpas have been \"spoiled\" by mountaineering and whether climbing itself has been spoiled by commercialism.Life and Death on Mt. Everest is a powerful and dramatic portrayal of a century of cultural encounters in one of the world's most breathtaking regions.

She shows how climbers' behavior toward the Sherpas has ranged from kindness to cruelty, from cultural sensitivity to derision. Ortner traces the political and economic factors that led the Sherpas to join expeditions andexamines the impact of climbing on their traditional culture, religion, and identity. She examines Sherpas' attitudes toward death, the implications of the shared masculinity of Sherpas and sahibs, and the relationship between Sherpas and the increasing number of women climbers. Ortner also tackles debates about whether the Sherpas have been \"spoiled\" by mountaineering and whether climbing itself has been spoiled by commercialism.Life and Death on Mt.

But while Hillary and the expedition's leader Lord Hunt both believed the Sherpa had been born in a remote mountain village in Nepal, a new book by American mountaineer Ed Webster claims that not only was Tenzing born in Tibet, but he spent much of his childhood there. The world's most famous Sherpa was not really a Sherpa at all. Even after Tenzing's death in 1986, the truth was considered too sensitive to disclose, not least for fear of embarrassing the Indian government which had supported Tenzing after his ascent. It would have handed a propaganda coup to the Chinese authorities in the Tibetan capital Lhasa that a 'Chinese climber' was the first to climb Everest. But now Webster has been given permission by the family to reveal the truth about Tenzing's real origins. Throughout his life, Tenzing remained vague about his background. In his autobiography, Tiger of the Snows, he obscured the truth of his childhood without quite denying it, telling ghostwriter James Ramsey Ullman he grew up in the village of Thame, in Nepal. In fact, his parents migrated there during the early 1920s after a period of financial hardship and debt to a local Tibetan governor. Tenzing, however, was more forthcoming about his birthplace, saying: 'I was born in a place called Tsa-chu, near the great mountain of Makalu, and only a day's march from Everest.' Tenzing also explains that when he was born, his mother had been on a pilgrimage to the nearby monastery at Ghang La, the name of Tenzing's house in Darjeeling. When Tenzing climbed Everest in 1953 he was hailed by the Nepali government in Kathmandu as a local hero who happened to live in India. Nepal's fledgling constitutional monarchy feared political domination by the new Indian republic and both countries saw great propaganda value in claiming Tenzing, the first humble-born Asian of the modern era to achieve global fame, as their own. Tenzing's caution about revealing his true origins was partly explained by this political wrangling. 'After we climbed Everest,' Hillary said, 'and Tenzing was invited to England, we were really in a jam because Tenzing had no passport.' The crisis was averted only when the Indian Prime Minister Pandit Nehru stepped in and personally ensured Tenzing received an Indian passport - something for which the Nepalese authorities never forgave him. Nehru became Tenzing's patron and authorised the establishment of a mountaineering school in Darjeeling, which Tenzing helped to run. To avoid political embarrassment, Tenzing described himself as 'born in the womb of Nepal and raised in the lap of India,' but that was far from the whole story. Now the full story has been revealed in Webster's Snow in the Kingdom, which describes an expedition in 1988 to the rarely visited East Face of Everest which approaches the mountain through the Tibetan Kharta Valley where Tenzing's home village of Moyun is located. Included in the team was Tenzing's oldest surviving son, Norbu, who was born in the Sherpa community at Darjeeling in India where his father had started his career as a climber after migrating there in the early 1930s. Norbu, like most Sherpas, knew all about his father's secret and, while in Tibet, he was able to meet long-lost relatives, including Tenzing's half-brother Tashi, and also to solve the riddle of Tenzing's birthplace. 'If Tenzing had come out with the truth that he was, in fact, a Tibetan, he would only have magnified his nationality problems, greatly disappointing India where he then lived,' Webster told The Observer. 'It's possible some Sherpas might have ridiculed him as something of an imposter, and as a social and cultural inferior.' All of Tenzing's three wives were Sherpas and he remains a potent hero in Darjeeling and the Khumbu. 'I believe Tenzing was a sensitive and a sincere man,' says Webster. 'His writings make this clear, so Tenzing never lied outright about his family origins - but he never told the full truth either. Perhaps he believed he was simply a mountaineer, and nationality didn't matter.' During the expedition in 1988, Webster identified the monastery at Ghang La as Namdag Lhe Phodang - the 'pure god's palace' - high in the Kama Valley of Tibet. The region is very sacred to Tibetan Buddhists, regarded as a 'heavenly refuge' in times of war and famine. Tsa-chu, or more accurately Tshechu, is another holy site in a remote side-valley not far from Ghang La. The yak pastures around the monastery command a superb view of Everest and are almost certainly where Tenzing spent his childhood summers. Both the family house and the monastery were destroyed following the Chinese invasion in 1950. Ironically, the Sherpa people originated in Kham in eastern Tibet, more than 1,000 miles from Everest, and migrated to Nepal in the sixteenth century. They still number only a few thousand in a Nepali population of 22 million but are world famous for their contribution to mountaineering. While the Sherpa homeland is considered to be the Solu-Khumbu region of Nepal south of Everest, the Sherpas have always had strong cultural and economic links with Tibetans across the border. Tenzing's cousin, a famous reincarnate lama called Ngwang Tenzin Norbu, founded monasteries at Rongbuk on the Tibetan side, and at Tengpoche on the Nepali side. Tenzing Norgay's cousin also gave him his name, which means 'fortunate supporter of religion'. The tradition of mountaineers hiring Sherpas began in Darjeeling at the start of the twentieth century; the hill men quickly proved the most reliable and physically capable porters. The best Sherpas were termed 'Tigers' and awarded medals. Mountain tourism proved lucrative and more migrated from the Everest region to India. Until 1949, Nepal remained closed to almost all Europeans. For Tenzing, whose parents were struggling to make a new life for themselves in the Khumbu, Darjeeling offered a chance for economic success, but his early years there were plagued by money problems as he sought to make his mark as a porter for Western mountaineers. Tenzing never saw his father again, and didn't return to the Khumbu to see his mother until 1952. When news of his sudden fame reached his homeland in Tibet, he was overwhelmed by 'all sorts of relatives I had never seen or heard of before'. Now, Sherpas earn thousands of dollars a year helping Western clients on Everest but, with the opening of Nepal to tourism, they no longer migrate to Darjeeling to look for work. Many Sherpas have become wealthy in a country where per capita income is $200 a year. The influx of tourists to the region Tenzing helped make famous has caused environmental problems, but has also helped alleviate the economic hardship caused by the Chinese occupation of Tibet. After the invasion of Tibet in 1950, China also claimed sovereignty of the Khumbu region of Nepal, which it saw as ethnically Tibetan.They mounted a number of Sino-Tibetan expeditions to Everest following the occupation for their propaganda value and still control access to the mountain. Kate Saunders of the Tibet Information Network told The Observer: 'The Chinese will understand very well the propaganda value of Tenzing's birth. They have never wasted an opportunity to stress Chinese sovereignty in Tibet.' Perhaps Webster's most intriguing claim is that the seven-year-old Tenzing Norgay may have met George Mallory, who disappeared on Everest in 1924 and whose body was discovered last year. According to the diary of fellow climber Guy Bullock, during the first expedition to Everest in August 1921, Mallory spent a day at Tenzing's home village before trekking through the summer pastures used by Tenzing's family to the foot of the mountain's East Face. Tall tales from the world's highest peak First identified as the world's highest peak in 1856 by the Survey of India and dubbed 'Peak XV'. The name Everest was suggested by Colonel Andrew Waugh, Surveyor General, to honour his predecessor, Sir George Everest. Everest actually pronounced his name Eve-rest. So we've been saying it wrong for 135 years. Tibetans and Sherpas call the mountain Chomolungma, usually translated as 'Mother Goddess of the Earth', although Tenzing Norgay's mum said it meant the 'Mountain So High No Bird Can Fly Over It'. The true height of Everest is still controversial. Scientists in America announced in November 1999 that the true height was 8,850m, two metres higher than the previous agreed standard 8,848m. First climbed via the South Col on 29 May 1953 by Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay. Since then there have been more than 1,300 ascents and over 170 deaths. Last spring 130 people reached the summit, 80 of them via the South Col. Sherpa Babu Chiri reached the summit in 16 hours 56 minutes from Base Camp. Overcrowding on the mountain has led to punch-ups over campsites and the use of fixed ropes that now litter it. Weirdest thing on the summit: the umbilical cord of French mountaineer Thierry Renault's son. Weirdest act on the summit: an American climber performed rodeo rope tricks wearing a cowboy outfit.

Giving the country its first medal in the current Olympics,29-year-old Gagan Narang lived upto expectations to claim the bronze,the third shooting medal in India’s Olympic history,but his overall performance was below his personal best. While Gagan Narang managed to be consistent enough to win the medal in his third Olympic appearance,Beijing Games gold medallist Bindra,who was also touted as a serious medal contender,finished a disappointing 16th in the qualification round. But the day clearly belonged to Gagan Narang who shot 598 in the qualification and held his nerve in the tense tie-breaker to claim the bronze medal in a virtual neck-and-neck contest. Gagan Narang had a total score of 701.1. Spurred on by the vociferous support of a sizeable Indian supporters and officials at the venue,Gagan Narang was done in by two poor scores of 9.7 (second round) and 9.5 (eighth round),which ultimately pegged him down to the third position. Alin George Moldoveanu of Romania bagged the coveted gold medal with a total of 702.1 while Italy’s Niccolo Campriani took the silver with a score of 701.5. Gagan Narang,who had taken part in the Athens and Beijing Games,and missed final berths by a whisker,was understandably relieved to have fulfilled his dream of winning an Olympic medal. “It is like a huge stone is off my chest. I had not managed to qualify for the finals in the last two Olympics and that was really painful,But now I am happy to have finally won an Olympic medal,” Gagan Narang told reporters here. Gagan Narang,who won four gold medals in the 2010 Commonwealth Games in New Delhi followed by two silver in the Guangzhou Asian Games a month later,said he was not really satisfied with his performance and should have returned with a better score. “I am not really happy. My coach is also not happy with the score. Scoring 600 is always challenging,but I made a few technical mistakes at certain points. But then an Olympic medal is an Olympic medal,” he said. Asked whether the celebrations back home would serve as a distraction for him in the two other events,he said “I don’t know what is happening back home. I am trying to stay focused for my two other events. “It (his effort) has been vindicated. In Beijing,I missed going to the finals due to a technicality.” “I think only a little credit goes out to me but my parents and sponsors have put in a lot of hard work which paid off.” On how he coped up with the pressure,Gagan Narang said,”Pressure was immense. I shot two nines today. I could have done better. But I am happy with my medal. It means a lot to a lot of people who have worked for this.” Gagan Narang finished third in the qualifications with 598 and started the finals well by shooting 10.7 in the first round. He then had a poor shot of 9.7 in the second round,though he made amends by reeling off scores of 10.7 10.4 and 10.6 in the subsequent rounds. With pressure mounting on him to be consistent,Gagan Narang produced a 10.7 in the very last round to ensure that he remained in the medal bracket. 📣 Join our Telegram channel (The Indian Express) for the latest news and updates For all the latest News Archive News, download Indian Express App. Follow Us: Monday, July 11, 2022 Subscribe Olympics 2012: Gagan Narang shoots bronze; India's 1st medal July 30, 2012 3:36:36 pm Premium Premium Premium Premium The Uber Files | The Indian Express is part of a global consortium analysing thousands of emails and documnets from Uber Live 44 mins ago 2 hours ago 4 hours ago 5 hours ago Jul 11: From the Print Featured More", "Sélectionner une édition des Jeux Beijing 2022 Tokyo 2020 PyeongChang 2018 Rio 2016 Sotchi 2014 Londres 2012 Vancouver 2010 Beijing 2008 Turin 2006 Athènes 2004 Salt Lake City 2002 Sydney 2000 Nagano 1998 Atlanta 1996 Lillehammer 1994 Barcelone 1992 Albertville 1992 Séoul 1988 Calgary 1988 Los Angeles 1984 Sarajevo 1984 Moscou 1980 Lake Placid 1980 Montréal 1976 Innsbruck 1976 Munich 1972 Sapporo 1972 Mexico 1968 Grenoble 1968 Tokyo 1964 Innsbruck 1964 Rome 1960 Squaw Valley 1960 Melbourne 1956 Cortina d'Ampezzo 1956 Helsinki 1952 Oslo 1952 Londres 1948 Saint-Moritz 1948 Berlin 1936 Garmisch-Partenkirchen 1936 Los Angeles 1932 Lake Placid 1932 Amsterdam 1928 Saint-Moritz 1928 Paris 1924 Chamonix 1924 Anvers 1920 Stockholm 1912 Londres 1908 St. Louis 1904 Paris 1900 Athènes 1896 Tokyo 2020 Rio 2016 Londres 2012 Beijing 2008 Athènes 2004 Sydney 2000 Atlanta 1996 Barcelone 1992 Séoul 1988 Los Angeles 1984 Moscou 1980 Montréal 1976 Munich 1972 Mexico 1968 Tokyo 1964 Rome 1960 Melbourne 1956 Helsinki 1952 Londres 1948 Berlin 1936 Los Angeles 1932 Amsterdam 1928 Paris 1924 Anvers 1920 Stockholm 1912 Londres 1908 St. Louis 1904 Paris 1900 Athènes 1896 Beijing 2022 PyeongChang 2018 Sotchi 2014 Vancouver 2010 Turin 2006 Salt Lake City 2002 Nagano 1998 Lillehammer 1994 Albertville 1992 Calgary 1988 Sarajevo 1984 Lake Placid 1980 Innsbruck 1976 Sapporo 1972 Grenoble 1968 Innsbruck 1964 Squaw Valley 1960 Cortina d'Ampezzo 1956 Oslo 1952 Saint-Moritz 1948 Garmisch-Partenkirchen 1936 Lake Placid 1932 Saint-Moritz 1928 Chamonix 1924 Sélectionner un sport Sélectionner une épreuve CIO Paris 2024 Milan Cortina 2026 LA 2028 Brisbane 2032 Musée Boutique Jeux Olympiques Loading...

England India Match yet to begin Ireland New Zealand Match yet to begin Ricky Ponting has announced his retirement from international cricket, on the eve of the third Test against South Africa in Perth \"I'm glad I've got the opportunity to go out on my terms\" • AFP Daniel Brettig is an assistant editor at ESPNcricinfo. He tweets here NewsPonting to retire after Perth TestRicky Ponting has announced his retirement from international cricket, on the eve of the third Test against South Africa in PerthDaniel Brettig29-Nov-2012\"I'm glad I've got the opportunity to go out on my terms\" • AFPAs emotional as anyone has ever seen him, Ricky Ponting lost his customary composure when telling team-mates of his decision to retire from international cricket on the eve of the third Test against South Africa in Perth.For so long the stony-faced embodiment of Australian cricket, Ponting and other members of the squad wept as they came to terms with the fact a Test career that began at the WACA ground in 1995 would end at the same ground 17 years later. \"I tried to tell them a lot, but I didn't get much out,\" Ponting said. \"As I said to the boys this morning, they've never seen me emotional, but I was this morning.\"If the decision drew a previously unseen well of feeling from within Ponting, its reasons were coldly logical and team-oriented. After failing twice with the bat in Adelaide and thrice in this series, having given himself the best possible lead-in via domestic cricket Ponting concluded that he was no longer good enough to perform at the level he preferred. For so long Ponting's watchword had been consistency - now he spoke ruefully of \"consistent failure\".Other considerations included choosing the best circumstances in which to allow his successor in the batting order to get started, a question Ponting had also pondered when handing over the captaincy to Clarke in 2011. As befitted a man whose proudest career achievement is to have played in more Test wins than any other cricketer, Ponting was also keen for the announcement to inspire, not overshadow, Australia's tilt at the world No. 1 ranking in this match.\"It's a decision I thought long and hard about, put in long consideration about the decision, at the end of the day it was about my results and my output in this series so far,\" Ponting said. \"It hasn't been to the level required for batsmen and players in the Australian team. My level of performance hasn't been good enough.\"I want to be a consistent performer, and if you look back over the last 12 or 18 months I haven't been able to perform consistently. I've had moments of really good stuff, and prolonged moments of cricket that's been below my expectations and below a par level for me, so there hasn't been one dismissal or one moment, it's just been in my own eyes reasonably consistent failure. That's why I believe the time is right now to be making this decision.\"Following a poor start to the Test series with low scores in Brisbane and Adelaide, Ponting said he was troubled by the \"tentative\" manner of his dismissals. In Adelaide he was bowled twice in the same match for only the second time in a career that began in 1995.That double was the catalyst for a typically frank interview with his first Test captain Mark Taylor on Channel Nine on the fourth morning in Adelaide, in which Ponting said he was soon to be discussing his future with the selectors. Discussions about retirement commenced during the Test, though Ponting said he always retained the support of the selectors, and made the call himself.\"I believe so, there's been all sorts of things in the papers the last couple of days and I know certainly with my captain and my coach I couldn't have had any more support from those guys,\" Ponting said. \"They've been the ones who've been most verbal about their support.\"This is not a decision that's been made by the selectors, this a decision that's been made by me, and I'd like to thank all those guys for the support they've given me over the last 12 months. There were probably moments when they thought long and hard about ending my career and I'm glad I've got the opportunity to finish this way and on my terms.\"The effect of Ponting's retirement was writ large across the red eyes of the captain, Michael Clarke. In summing up the few days leading up to the announcement, Clarke became so teary that he recalled the welling up of emotion that accompanied Kim Hughes' exit as captain in 1984. While the reasons were entirely different, the feeling was equally strong - Clarke could not answer another question about his team-mate, friend and predecessor as captain.\"I didn't have a feeling it was coming,\" Clarke said. \"Ricky spoke to me after the Adelaide Test match and made his decision I guess over the last few days. The boys are obviously hurting at the moment. He's been an amazing player for a long time. [Deep breath and starts to tear up]… and that'll do me for today. Sorry, I can't answer that.\"Ponting will play out the domestic season for Tasmania and the Hobart Hurricanes in the BBL. He does not yet know what will be ahead of him beyond the summer, but gestured towards his wife Rianna and children when queried about what the future held.\"I've got a few months of cricket yet, which I am really looking forward to. I really enjoyed the start of this season playing cricket with Tasmania and back with some of my mates - really I place I haven't spent a lot of time for near on the last 20 years. So I'll enjoy that for what it is, but this is my new team here,\" Ponting said, pointing to his family.As for the question of his contribution to cricket, Ponting had a simple and affecting answer. While delivering it he came close to tears again, those his team-mates had shared a few hours before.\"I know I've given cricket my all,\" Ponting said. \"It's been life for 20 years. Not much more I can give.\"Ricky PontingSouth AfricaAustraliaAustralia vs South AfricaSouth Africa tour of AustraliaDaniel Brettig is an assistant editor at ESPNcricinfo.

For so long the stony-faced embodiment of Australian cricket, Ponting and other members of the squad wept as they came to terms with the fact a Test career that began at the WACA ground in 1995 would end at the same ground 17 years later. \"I tried to tell them a lot, but I didn't get much out,\" Ponting said. \"As I said to the boys this morning, they've never seen me emotional, but I was this morning.\" If the decision drew a previously unseen well of feeling from within Ponting, its reasons were coldly logical and team-oriented. After failing twice with the bat in Adelaide and thrice in this series, having given himself the best possible lead-in via domestic cricket Ponting concluded that he was no longer good enough to perform at the level he preferred. For so long Ponting's watchword had been consistency - now he spoke ruefully of \"consistent failure\". Other considerations included choosing the best circumstances in which to allow his successor in the batting order to get started, a question Ponting had also pondered when handing over the captaincy to Clarke in 2011. As befitted a man whose proudest career achievement is to have played in more Test wins than any other cricketer, Ponting was also keen for the announcement to inspire, not overshadow, Australia's tilt at the world No. 1 ranking in this match. \"It's a decision I thought long and hard about, put in long consideration about the decision, at the end of the day it was about my results and my output in this series so far,\" Ponting said. \"It hasn't been to the level required for batsmen and players in the Australian team. My level of performance hasn't been good enough. \"I want to be a consistent performer, and if you look back over the last 12 or 18 months I haven't been able to perform consistently. I've had moments of really good stuff, and prolonged moments of cricket that's been below my expectations and below a par level for me, so there hasn't been one dismissal or one moment, it's just been in my own eyes reasonably consistent failure. That's why I believe the time is right now to be making this decision.\" Following a poor start to the Test series with low scores in Brisbane and Adelaide, Ponting said he was troubled by the \"tentative\" manner of his dismissals. In Adelaide he was bowled twice in the same match for only the second time in a career that began in 1995. That double was the catalyst for a typically frank interview with his first Test captain Mark Taylor on Channel Nine on the fourth morning in Adelaide, in which Ponting said he was soon to be discussing his future with the selectors. Discussions about retirement commenced during the Test, though Ponting said he always retained the support of the selectors, and made the call himself. \"I believe so, there's been all sorts of things in the papers the last couple of days and I know certainly with my captain and my coach I couldn't have had any more support from those guys,\" Ponting said. \"They've been the ones who've been most verbal about their support. \"This is not a decision that's been made by the selectors, this a decision that's been made by me, and I'd like to thank all those guys for the support they've given me over the last 12 months. There were probably moments when they thought long and hard about ending my career and I'm glad I've got the opportunity to finish this way and on my terms.\" The effect of Ponting's retirement was writ large across the red eyes of the captain, Michael Clarke. In summing up the few days leading up to the announcement, Clarke became so teary that he recalled the welling up of emotion that accompanied Kim Hughes' exit as captain in 1984. While the reasons were entirely different, the feeling was equally strong - Clarke could not answer another question about his team-mate, friend and predecessor as captain. \"I didn't have a feeling it was coming,\" Clarke said. \"Ricky spoke to me after the Adelaide Test match and made his decision I guess over the last few days. The boys are obviously hurting at the moment. He's been an amazing player for a long time. [Deep breath and starts to tear up]… and that'll do me for today. Sorry, I can't answer that.\" Ponting will play out the domestic season for Tasmania and the Hobart Hurricanes in the BBL. He does not yet know what will be ahead of him beyond the summer, but gestured towards his wife Rianna and children when queried about what the future held. \"I've got a few months of cricket yet, which I am really looking forward to. I really enjoyed the start of this season playing cricket with Tasmania and back with some of my mates - really I place I haven't spent a lot of time for near on the last 20 years. So I'll enjoy that for what it is, but this is my new team here,\" Ponting said, pointing to his family. As for the question of his contribution to cricket, Ponting had a simple and affecting answer. While delivering it he came close to tears again, those his team-mates had shared a few hours before. \"I know I've given cricket my all,\" Ponting said. \"It's been life for 20 years. Not much more I can give.\" Ricky Ponting South Africa Australia Australia vs South Africa South Africa tour of Australia Terms of Use • Terms of Use Terms of Use • Privacy Policy • Privacy Policy Privacy Policy • Your California Privacy Rights • Your California Privacy Rights Your California Privacy Rights • Children's Online Privacy Policy • Children's Online Privacy Policy Children's Online Privacy Policy • Interest - Based Ads • Interest - Based Ads Interest - Based Ads • Do Not Sell My Personal Information • Do Not Sell My Personal Information Do Not Sell My Personal Information • Feedback Feedback Feedback", "", "", "Former Australian cricket captain Ricky Ponting has decided to retire from cricket after the Perth Test. The former Australian captain has underperformed so far this series and confirmed the third Test against South Africa in Perth will be his last. Ponting will equal Steve Waugh's mark of 168 Test matches in this match, the most in the history of Australian cricket. The entire Australian squad turned up for the press conference on Friday in Perth where Ponting made his announcement. Turning 38 next month, Ponting is the highest Australian run-scorer of all time and has been described as the greatest Australian batsman outside Sir Donald Bradman. The Tasmanian has 13,336 Test runs to his name, only Indian Sachin Tendulkar has scored more in the history of cricket. Ponting suggested after the second Test in Adelaide where he made four and 16 that the end might be near, and his fate was now in the hands of selectors.

After all the speculation as to whether Harbhajan Singh would continue in the job or if Sachin Tendulkar would be given the responsibility, the franchise sprung the surprise on Thursday (February 21) afternoon. Ponting, who was bought at the base price of US$ 400,000 during the auction earlier in February, was earlier a part of the Kolkata Knight Riders set-up. “It’s a huge honour and I thank Mrs (Nita) Ambani and the Mumbai Indians management for the faith they have reposed in my abilities,” said Ponting in a statement issued by the franchise. “Mumbai Indians has the potent combination of Indian and international cricketers and I look forward to leading the team to play to its full potential.” The Mumbai Indians owners, in consultation with Anil Kumble, the team’s Chief Mentor, John Wright, the new Head Coach, and Tendulkar, decided on Ponting to lead the side. “Ricky has a lot of experience to lead a competitive and a high-profile side like Mumbai Indians in the IPL,” said Kumble. “Sachin readily agreed to my suggestion that Mumbai Indians is best served when he leads the batting unburdened by the rigours of captaincy. It was our idea (Sachin and mine) to bring in Ricky as the captain of the Mumbai Indians.” In the statement, Nita Ambani said, “I welcome Ricky Ponting to the team as the leader of the side. Today we have world’s two biggest cricketing greats in Sachin and Ricky, and I am sure the duo will be an inspiration for the youngsters in the team. Sachin will always be an integral and important part of Mumbai Indians’ leadership. Ricky will bring in fresh perspective in the team leadership and will have the support of the best cricketing minds like Sachin, Anil and John Wright.” Mumbai Indians will start their IPL 2013 campaign on April 4 in Bangalore.

Ponting is currently doing duty for Surrey in England, and will be part of the Mumbai Indians squad in the Champions League. “While I’m enjoying my cricket as much as ever, it just feels like the right time to finish playing. My body and mind are in great shape and I know I’m going to really enjoy these last few months before the next stage of life begins,” Ponting told the Daily Mail. Ponting was designated the Mumbai Indians captain before the start of IPL VI, but stepped down half-way through the tournament due to lack of form, and watched from the sidelines as the side ended triumphant. Before this year’s IPL, he had been part of Tasmania’s victorious campaign in the Sheffield Shield. He is scheduled to join the Antigua Hawksbills in July for the inaugural Caribbean Premier League. “To win the Sheffield Shield with Tasmania in my last game in Australia played at Blundstone Arena, will forever be a memory close to my heart. It’s one of a lifetime of memories that will become even more special to me in retirement,” said Ponting. “I’m so grateful for the opportunities that the game of cricket has given to me. I’ve played with so many outstanding people at all levels of cricket with lifelong friendships made.” Ponting retired from Test cricket in December 2012 as the second highest run-getter in the game with 13,378 runs in 168 matches. He was also part of three World Cup winning Australian sides, two of which he captained. He indicated that he would remain connected with the game through coaching and mentoring opportunities, and also has options in cricket media that he’s considering. “I’m considering a couple of options in the cricket media and I’m very fortunate to have a wonderful group of commercial partners that I will be continuing to work with,” said Ponting, who will be writing exclusively for Sportsmail during this summer’s Ashes Test series in England. “My autobiography comes out in late October so I’ve also got a couple of busy months on my Book Tour when I get back. I got a taste for the off field demands of coaching, mentoring and leadership at Mumbai. I’d like to do more of this in the future.” Paying tribute to his former captain, Michael Clarke, the current Australia skipper, said: “He’s been an amazing player, there’s no doubt about it, and (he’s) done so much for the game of cricket.” Playing down talk that Ponting should be called out of international retirement to play the Ashes series in England, especially after he hit 192 on his Surrey debut this month, Clarke said, “He retired from the Australian cricket team. We’ve got a new team here and we are looking forward to this series.” Tagged in: Australia CLT2013 IPL 2013 Mumbai Indians Ricky Ponting Sheffield Shield Surrey Former Australia captain earns domestic crown with strong performances for Tasmania England batsman says he is 'good as gold' at the moment, shrugs off drama surrounding Swann's exit from the game What is the key to India doing well in the Tests against South Africa?
