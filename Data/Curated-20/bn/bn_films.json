The 1967 movie, which starred Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway as notorious 1930s bank robbers Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker, not only introduced movie audiences to a group of important new actors but also changed the way movies were made, how they depicted violence and the manner in which they were marketed. The film received 10 Academy Award nominations, including best picture, director and five acting performances. With an excellent remastered version of \"Bonnie and Clyde\" out this month on DVD, here's a look at some of the people who left their mark on the film. Screenwriters Robert Benton and David Newman: These two editors at Esquire wanted to write a screenplay offering a new perspective on 1930s gangsters. But their story not only challenged the old ways of Hollywood by making their outlaw protagonists the glamorous heroes, it also reflected the rising anti-authoritarian spirit of the late 1960s and the violence in America at home and in the Vietnam War. Actor-producer Warren Beatty: Already a movie star, Beatty loved Benton and Newman's script and wanted to produce it. He became the first actor-producer of his generation when he persuaded Warner Bros. to finance the movie and put him in charge of it. Although Beatty originally thought of Bob Dylan for the role of Clyde, he eventually took it for himself and received an Oscar nomination for his efforts. He's been a major actor, director and producer ever since. Director Arthur Penn: Penn had directed Beatty in the movie \"Mickey One\" and took the \"Bonnie and Clyde\" assignment after some more famous directors, including William Wyler and George Stevens, turned it down. Despite some creative differences that were resolved during filmmaking, he and Beatty worked closely together on the film. Both Beatty and Penn defend the film's depiction of bloody violence, the director noting that violence was \"imbedded in the characters they were playing\" and Beatty saying, \"We didn't prettify killing.\" Actress Faye Dunaway: Her sexy and charismatic performance as Bonnie won Dunaway an Oscar nomination and made her a major movie star. \"It's the role that was closest to me — that type of Southern girl wanting to get out,\" she says. Actors Gene Hackman, Estelle Parsons, Michael J. Pollard and Gene Wilder: A struggling actor before taking the role of Buck Barrow, Clyde's older brother (he had worked with Beatty before on \"Lilith\"), Hackman relaunched his career with his bravura performance. Both he and Pollard, as the gang's driver, C.W. Moss, received Oscar nominations, while Parsons, as Clyde's high-strung wife, Blanche, took home the supporting actress trophy. Wilder make his auspicious movie debut as an undertaker picked up by the Barrow gang for a short ride. Film critics Bosley Crowther and Pauline Kael: The most powerful critic of his day, The New York Times' Crowther hated \"Bonnie and Clyde,\" calling it \"a cheap piece of bald-faced slapstick comedy that treats the hideous depredations of that sleazy, moronic pair as though they were as full of fun and frolic as the jazz-age cutups in Thoroughly Modern Millie.' \" At first a flop at the box office when Warner Bros. gave it a halfhearted release in April 1967, \"Bonnie and Clyde\" became the most-talked-about movie in America after Beatty took over the publicity campaign — featuring the unforgettable slogan \"They're young ... they're in love ... and they kill people\" — and engineered its rerelease that August. Aiding the film's critical acceptance was a lengthy essay by Pauline Kael in The New Yorker, in which she strongly defended the film's artistic use of violence and called it \"the most excitingly American movie since The Manchurian Candidate.' \" \"Bonnie and Clyde,\" which cost $2.5 million to make, went on to take in $50 million at the box office in America alone and an estimated $70 million worldwide. 0 Share Tweet Email Print April 03, 2008 SHARE April 03, 2008 April 03, 2008 0 0 0 Share Tweet Email Print", "Members Login © 2022 Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Menu Search Home Awards Awards Oscars Governors Awards Scientific and Technical Awards Shop Museum Museum About the Museum Explore Explore A.frame Events Calendar Collection Highlights Academy Originals Our Story News Videos & Photos Learn Learn About Membership Academy Film Archive Margaret Herrick Library Oral History SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY COUNCIL Academy Gold Academy Gold About Gold Gold Rising Nicholl Fellowships Student Academy Awards Fellowship for Women Alumni Program Careers in Film Grants Member Login The 40th Academy Awards | 1968 1968 Wednesday, April 10, 1968 Share FacebookTwitter Share Highlights Memorable Moments Winner In the Heat of the Night Bonnie and Clyde The Graduate Cool Hand Luke Guess Who's Coming to Dinner Winner Cool Hand Luke The Dirty Dozen Bonnie and Clyde Guess Who's Coming to Dinner Bonnie and Clyde Winner Guess Who's Coming to Dinner The Graduate Bonnie and Clyde The Whisperers Wait until Dark Winner Bonnie and Clyde Thoroughly Modern Millie Barefoot in the Park Guess Who's Coming to Dinner The Graduate Winner Art Direction: John Truscott, Edward Carrere; Set Decoration: John W.

Because of the occurrence of phrases, here and there, from some familiar melodies, inserted, in most cases, for comic effect, and the use of “La Violetera” (Who’ll buy my Violets [By José Padilla]) as a theme for the blind flower girl, Chaplin was assumed, by some, to be stretching his claim to everything in the film. Attitudes changed with the subsequent appearances of Chaplin scores in \"Modern Times\", \"The Great Dictator\", and \"Monsieur Verdoux\" (The two latter talkies with occasional musical interludes and “background music”), and with the full score for the reissued \"The Gold Rush\". A quality, which can only be described as “Chaplinesque” was discerned and commented upon in this music, despite the fact that it was arranged and orchestrated by other hands. Those who still believe that Chaplin merely hummed a tune ot two and that “real musicians” did the rest have only to listen to the scores of several of his films. The style is marked and individual. It shows a fondness for romantic waltz hesitations played in very rubato time, lively numbers in two-four time which might be called “promenade themes”, and tangos with a strong beat. It can now be seen that Chaplin’s music is an integral part of his film conceptions. In similar fashion D.W Griffith also composed some musical themes for his pictures. But perhaps of no other one man can it be said that he wrote, directed, acted, and scored a motion picture. Incidentally, Chaplin even conducted the orchestra, himself, during recordings, an added reason for the satisfying impression of wholeness in the Chaplin films. Although musically untrained, Chaplin nevertheless has the advantages of a musical inheritance from his ballad-singer father, the natural endowment of a quick ear, and a superb sense of rhythm, a taste for the art, experience with it on the stage, and an amateur performer’s devotion to it. In “My Trip Abroad” there is a passage describing his first consciousness of music. As a boy, in Kennington Cross, he was enraptured by a weird duet on clarinet and harmonica, to a tune he later identified as the popular song, “The Honeysuckle and the bee”. “It was played with such feeling that I became conscious, for the first time, of what melody really was” According to Fred Karno’s biography, young Chaplin spent much of his leisure time between shows picking out tunes on an old cello. When Chaplin was signed by the Essanay Company, he bought a violin on which he scraped for hours at night, to the annoyance of less wakeful actors when they all lived next to the studio at Niles, California. While he was being feted during the negociations with the Mutual Company in New York, Chaplin, appearing at a benefit concert at the old Hippodrome (February 20, 1916), led Sousa’s band in the “Poet and Peasant” overture and his own composition “The Peace Patrol”. That same year Chaplin published two songs “Oh that cello” and “There’s always someone you can’t forget”, which was a musical tribute to his first romance. In the twenties he made records of his “Sing a song” and “With you, Dear, in Bombay”, both later used in the sound version of \"The Gold Rush\". Subsequent years saw the publication of a theme from \"The Great Dictator\" to a lyric entitled “Falling Star”, and three numbers from \"Monsieur Verdoux\" : “A Paris Boulevard”, “Tango Bitterness”, and “Rumba”. After Chaplin made his first million, he installed a pipe organ in his Beverly Hills mansion. In certain moods he is known to have fingered this expensive instrument for hours at a time. Realizing the importance of musical accompaniment to the silent film, Chaplin sought to have it reproduced in every theatre exactly as he wished it. He supervised the cue sheets (lists of numbers to be played, sent free to all theatres booking a film) of his pictures from \"The Kid\" (1921) up to \"City Lights\" (1931) – when it was possible to have the music recorded on the film itself. Then it also was commercially expedient to claim at least “music and sound effects” since by 1931 the silent picture has been superseded by the talkie. Arthur Johnston and Alfred Newman arranged and orchestrated the music for \"City Lights\", Chaplin’s outstanding score. But the melodies, with the exceptions noted above, used for the associations they would evoke, were composed by Chaplin. At least twenty numbers in the score could be published as separate and original works. As was customary in the scoring for silent pictures, the Wagnerian leitmotiv system was followed – a distinctive musical theme associated with which character and idea. The musical cues in \"City Lights\" come to some ninety-five, not accounting the passages where the music follows or mimics the action in what is generally known as “mickey-mousing” from its use in the scoring of animated cartoons. A fanfare on trumpets, over a night scene, opens the picture proper. It is heard again as a sort of fate theme at moments of crises, such as the count over Charlie in the boxing ring, and his capture and imprisonment. Saxophone bleating, in slightly off synchronization with the lips, mimics the speakers at the unveiling of the moment. This shrill squeaking is used not only as a comic note itself, but as a burlesque of the talkies. When Charlie is ordered down, a bustling “galop” number in G minorn, played in fast tempo, accompanies his scrambling over the statues. The Tramp’s wanderings through the city streets are accompanied by a gallant bitter-sweet melody mostly on the cello. The theme is repeated seven times when he is in hopeful moods. The flower girl’s principal theme is José Padilla’s “La Violetera”, and phrases of it are played behind the Tramp, when it is pertinent to indicate that his thoughts dwell on her. She had two subsidiary themes, one a pathetique for scenes in her slum room, and the other a violin caprice, for her wistful moments. The music behind the tramp’s meeting with the eccentric millionaire is an amusing burlesque of opera. A dramatic theme introduces him and is followed by an over-dramatic agitato as he ties the suicide noose. Charlie’s dissuasions are musically rendered in burlesqued opera recitative. Another kind of music is kidded in the accompaniment to Charlie’s promise that “Tomorrow the birds will sing” – the “April-showers, silver-lining, rainbow-round-my-shoulder” sort of “theme song” that echoed through early talkies, particularly in the Al Jolson films. In later sequences the tramp has only to point upward in mock-heroic fashion; no title is necessary, the music “tells” what he is saying. The nightclub music for the “burning up the town” is a hectic jazz theme with a long sustained high note and marked rhythm. A rumba-like number accompanies the party scene where the tramp swallows the whistle. When the millionaire wakes sober, to find a stranger sharing his bed, there is a snatch of Rimsky-Korsakov’s ballet “Scheherazade” – played in duet form – in low register for the perplexed millionaire and high for the tramp. In like manner bits of “How dry I am”, “I hear you calling me”, etc…are called upon for comic comments. There are two love themes – one a light romantic waltz played very rubato to action, and a tragic piece associated with the Tramp’s hopeless love. Played also behind the tragic of the picture, with its grim and fateful chords, the second has a distinct Puccini flavor. A sprightly theme on the bassoon accompanies many of the tramp’s more humorous moments, such as his mishaps behind the streetcleaner’s cart; and there is a singularly amusing use of a tango during the boxing sequence. The fight itself is underlined by a feverish musical “hurry”, also used behind other fast action. It is true that one or two of the minor numbers are reminiscent. A short dance piece resembles “I want to be happy”. The famous apache dance is a paraphrase. The crooked-fighter theme sounds a bit like “Lock Cut for Jimmy Valentine”. Some Debussy chords herald the morning, and the “Second Hungarian Rhapsody” is cleverly jazzed up for a little chase scene. A film eighty-seven minutes long calls for a score of about a hundred and fifty pages and a little “borrowing” here and there can be overlooked. \"City Lights\" ends with the following music. The tramp, let out of prison, searches for the blind girl. Sequence * Music* Cue 91. Tramp comes to corner where “La Violetera”[by José Padilla] Girl used to sell flowers… (Played slowly) Cue 92. Tramp wanders the streets… Tramp Theme Cue 93. Tramp finds flowers in gutter… “La Violetera” [by José Padilla] Cue 94. He turns to the girl in the window Violin Caprice Of her shop laughing at him… (secondary girl theme) Cue 95. Girl touches hand of tramp… Tragic love theme Incidentally, sound effects are sparingly used, and then only for deliberately pointed effects, like the swallowed whistly, bells, the firing of revolvers etc... Falls and blows are not accented by traps, nor are there the other tasteless noises by ratchets, etc…that have featured so many “revivals with sound added”, copies from the distracting technique of sound cartoons. Above all, the human voice is not employed, an artistic mistake too often made in attempts to bring old silent pictures “up to date”. The haunting and pleasant Chaplin melodies in \"City Lights\" are pleasing in themselves, but the picture is one of the few extant examples of the silent medium’s power when wedded to a musical score which properly interprets the action and heightens the emotion. The legend has grown that silent pictures were accompanied by a thinkling piano, either played thumpily in the so-called “nickelodeon” manner, or in a more dignified, but essentially neutral style. Actually, from 1914 on, every town of five thousand or over had at least a three-piece orchestra – or an organ. The Griffith and Fairbanks films, specials like “The Covered Wagon” and “The Big parade”, all had orchestras travelling with them, playing scores as carefully worked out as \"City Lights\". By strict musical standards Chaplin’s score may not equal those of Virgil Thompson, Max Steiner, Georges Auric or William Walton. Thompson’s scoring for “The River” and “Louisiana Story”, with extremely clever arrangements of old folk tunes, is far more sophisticated and intellectual. Nor does Chaplin possess the virtuosity and present grandiose manner of Steiner, where too often sheer bombast attempts to make up for the emotional vacuity in the picture itself. But who, better than Chaplin, could point up musically the tragic-comic adventures of the tramp character he himself created ?

", "Charlie Chaplin's signature character, the gentlemanly vagabond known as the Little Tramp, appeared in numerous short films in the 1910s, followed by several features in the '20s and '30s. The Tramp was insanely popular, becoming one of the most recognized fictional characters in the world, perhaps the most recognized until Mickey Mouse -- who Walt Disney said was partially inspired by the Tramp -- came along. Among the character's most beloved films was City Lights, still considered one of the finest movies of the silent era. But is it still funny? Was it even funny then? What's the big deal? Let's put on our big shoes, derby hats, and fake mustaches and consider. The praise: In 1949, film critic James Agee called the final scene of City Lights \"the greatest single piece of acting ever committed to celluloid.\" Coming in 69th among all movies, it's the highest-ranked silent film by Internet Movie Database users. The American Film Institute named it the #1 best romantic comedy of all time, the 38th best comedy, and 11th best film of any genre (the highest comedy on the list). The British Film Institute's Sight and Sound magazine's first survey of film critics, in 1952, put City Lights as the second greatest film of all time (behind Bicycle Thieves). Orson Welles called it his favorite movie, and Stanley Kubrick had it in his top five. The context: The advent of sound in motion pictures caused a general upheaval in Hollywood, as many performers who had honed their craft in the silent era -- or who had annoying voices -- wondered if their talents would survive the transition. But few had more to lose than Charlie Chaplin. Since his film debut in 1914, Chaplin, aided by his trademark Little Tramp character, had become the biggest movie star in the world. His Gold Rush (1925) and The Circus (1928) were among the top 10 highest-grossing movies of the silent era. He co-founded the United Artists film studio and exercised almost complete control over his own films, writing, directing, producing, editing, and starring in them, in addition to composing the musical scores. His personal life was tabloid fodder; one biographer says his romance with the much younger Lita Grey -- he was 35 when they became involved; she was 16 -- was the inspiration for Vladimir Navokov's novel Lolita. And Chaplin was extremely rich: his and Grey's divorce, in 1927, set a record with its $825,000 settlement, plus a million bucks in legal fees. But even the biggest movie star in the world is not invincible. When The Jazz Singer introduced mass audiences to the wonders of talking pictures in October 1927, the days of the silent film quickly became numbered, but Chaplin had no interest in converting. He told Motion Picture Magazine in 1929 that the talkies were \"spoiling the oldest art in the world -- the art of pantomime. They are ruining the great beauty of silence.\" It wasn't just that Chaplin was old-school or stubborn, though both were true. It was that he knew caving in to the changing times and letting the Little Tramp's voice be heard -- even if it's what audiences claimed they wanted -- would be an artistic disaster. The character was too closely associated with pantomime. Changing him so fundamentally would be like making Hannibal Lecter into a vegetarian. Chaplin's concession was to make films like City Lights (1931) and Modern Times (1936), which are essentially silent films but have musical scores and sound effects. They even include some buzzy \"talking\" from a few minor characters (similar to the adults in the Charlie Brown cartoons) -- but not from the Little Tramp himself. (We do hear the Tramp's voice at the end of Modern Times, but it's in a song sung completely in gibberish, preserving the character's mystique.) City Lights began production as a straightforward silent film in 1928, when it was still uncertain whether talkies were a permanent game-changer or a passing fad. (The majority of feature-length films in 1927 and 1928 were still silent.) But Hollywood's quick embracing of the new technology -- aided by the exhibitors' willingness to install sound systems in their theaters -- put the handwriting on the wall, and Chaplin actually halted production on City Lights so he could figure out what to do. Production resumed -- and then the stock market crashed, in October 1929, making the film an even bigger gamble. The longer it took to finish the movie, Chaplin feared, the more archaic it was going to seem when people saw it. But speed was never one of Chaplin's strong points. He was a notorious perfectionist, frequently shooting scenes dozens and dozens of times before being satisfied (a terrible burden on the actors, until you remember that he was one of them). He fired actress Virginia Cherrill midway through production and started re-shooting her scenes with Georgia Hale, his Gold Rush co-star, before concluding that this was too expensive, even by his standards, and bringing Cherrill back to finish. All of this meant City Lights, like most of Chaplin's movies, took a long time to film. By the time it opened, in January 1931, there was every chance that audiences would consider it a dinosaur, an embarrassing effort by a powerful star to cling to the past, like Bill Cosby's Fat Albert movie. But instead, audiences and critics alike loved City Lights. Now in the throes of the Great Depression, people may have responded to something that reminded them of the Roaring '20s, not to mention the film's now-timely themes of class distinctions and poverty. It became one of Chaplin's biggest box-office successes and bought him a few more years of superstardom. The movie: An unnamed Little Tramp meets two new friends. One is a millionaire who likes to get drunk and paint the town red with his new Tramp pal. (When he's sober, he doesn't remember who the Tramp is.) The other is a beautiful blind girl who sells flowers on the street and with whom the Tramp is smitten. He tries to help her. It gets kind of sweet. What it influenced: Woody Allen has said that the last scene in his Manhattan was inspired by the last scene in City Lights. The 1992 Al Pacino film Scent of a Woman has a main character who is blind and, as an homage, uses bits of Chaplin's City Lights musical score. We expect successful movies to inspire imitators, but the popularity of City Lights didn't encourage other directors to keep making non-talkies. It seemed to be understood that this was an exception, that from now on only Chaplin could get away with silence, and maybe not even him, not for long. The enduring legacy of City Lights is summarized by Roger Ebert: \"If only one of Charles Chaplin's films could be preserved, City Lights would come the closest to representing all the different notes of his genius. It contains the slapstick, the pathos, the pantomime, the effortless physical coordination, the melodrama, the bawdiness, the grace, and, of course, the Little Tramp.\" Many films are funny; many films are touching; City Lights is both, and to such a degree that the combination has rarely been duplicated. Chaplin cited it as his personal favorite among all his films, which should count for something. What to look for: The opening titles call it \"a comedy romance in pantomime,\" yet it seems like a long time before the \"romance\" element is established. Chaplin liked to start production on his films with only a handful of sketch ideas and let the story emerge gradually (another reason the films took forever to make). Some scenes appear to have been included not because they advance the plot but because they're funny as freestanding comedy sketches. Don't fret. Just enjoy it, and wait for it all to come together. Note also that Chaplin was beloved and funny even though he was a mime. Mimes weren't universally loathed in those days. Clowns either, apparently. My, how the times have changed. The first scene makes it clear what Chaplin thinks of \"talking pictures\": the speech of the pretentious man at the unveiling of a monument is conveyed with a grating kazoo-like sound. Chaplin seems to be saying, \"You want movies that talk? Here's what talking sounds like to me.\" Chaplin was adamant about the characters not speaking, but that didn't mean he couldn't use the soundtrack for comic effect. There's a great bit where the Tramp accidentally swallows a whistle and thereafter can't stop emitting whistle sounds. A sequence at a boxing match uses the bell for a gag that wouldn't have worked if the cinema audience couldn't actually hear the sound of it. Chaplin, who had perfected his pantomime art in live theater -- where sound WAS an option -- was only opposed to sound when the joke didn't need it. As a director and editor, Chaplin's style was to avoid unnecessary cutting and simply let a scene play out in front of the camera. That's how it works on the vaudeville stage, after all -- and besides, cutting to a different angle can ruin a joke by interrupting its rhythm. So you'll notice long, unbroken takes containing an astounding amount of physical comedy that must have required weeks of rehearsal and involved numerous outtakes. The boxing sequence is one of the most amazing, with Chaplin, a referee, and a prizefighter, all moving around the ring in an expertly choreographed, flawlessly executed comic ballet. It's the same \"nothing up my sleeve\" philosophy as in many of Fred Astaire's dance movies: If you're going to go to the trouble of learning these complicated steps, you might as well let the audience see how good you are at doing them. An unsung hero in the film is Harry Myers, the actor who plays the eccentric millionaire. Though this is the only time he ever worked with Chaplin, he was a veteran of silent films, and his expertise is clear. In the scenes of him and Chaplin together, Chaplin's the one getting the laughs, but Myers' work is just as crucial in making the gags work. Again, most of these routines are carried out right before our eyes, with minimal cutting: Chaplin and Myers had to know exactly what they were doing for it to work. This movie also contains a joke about elephant poop. Seriously, elephant poop. In a 1931 movie. This impresses me. Finally, just as a point of interest, Florence Lee, who plays the flower girl's grandmother, was born in 1858. I think it's amazing to see film footage of someone old enough to remember the Civil War. What's the big deal: While everyone else in Hollywood had either embraced talking pictures, resigned themselves to their inevitability, or given up, Chaplin alone held out. Think about that: He was the only one with enough clout to even make a silent film in 1931, let alone pull it off so gracefully. Chaplin was wrong about sound ruining cinema, but he was right that it would have ruined the Little Tramp. He knew that no matter how unfashionable silent films became, they were the only genre in which this character would work. If it meant he couldn't make films with this character anymore, so be it. He never compromised his vision or his commitment to the craft of comedy. City Lights, therefore, wasn't just a hilarious and poignant romantic comedy. It was also a bold stand against change-for-the-sake-of-change, a firm declaration of artistic principle that marked Chaplin's career to the end. Further reading: If you don't already know how the movie ends, it really is lovely to let it sneak up on you. So don't read these until you've seen it. DeWitt Bodeen's essay at Film Reference is enjoyable to read and has a lengthy bibliography if you want to know more about Chaplin and this film. Roger Ebert's essay has some valuable insights, including an account of seeing the film with Chaplin in attendance. You may enjoy Sid Silverman's 1931 review of the film for Variety.

View the original article on film.com Charlie Chaplin's signature character, the gentlemanly vagabond known as the Little Tramp, appeared in numerous short films in the 1910s, followed by several features in the '20s and '30s. The Tramp was insanely popular, becoming one of the most recognized fictional characters in the world, perhaps the most recognized until Mickey Mouse -- who Walt Disney said was partially inspired by the Tramp -- came along. Among the character's most beloved films was City Lights, still considered one of the finest movies of the silent era. But is it still funny? Was it even funny then? What's the big deal? Let's put on our big shoes, derby hats, and fake mustaches and consider. The praise: In 1949, film critic James Agee called the final scene of City Lights \"the greatest single piece of acting ever committed to celluloid.\" Coming in 69th among all movies, it's the highest-ranked silent film by Internet Movie Database users. The American Film Institute named it the #1 best romantic comedy of all time, the 38th best comedy, and 11th best film of any genre (the highest comedy on the list). The British Film Institute's Sight and Sound magazine's first survey of film critics, in 1952, put City Lights as the second greatest film of all time (behind Bicycle Thieves). Orson Welles called it his favorite movie, and Stanley Kubrick had it in his top five. The context: The advent of sound in motion pictures caused a general upheaval in Hollywood, as many performers who had honed their craft in the silent era -- or who had annoying voices -- wondered if their talents would survive the transition. But few had more to lose than Charlie Chaplin. Since his film debut in 1914, Chaplin, aided by his trademark Little Tramp character, had become the biggest movie star in the world. His Gold Rush (1925) and The Circus (1928) were among the top 10 highest-grossing movies of the silent era. He co-founded the United Artists film studio and exercised almost complete control over his own films, writing, directing, producing, editing, and starring in them, in addition to composing the musical scores. His personal life was tabloid fodder; one biographer says his romance with the much younger Lita Grey -- he was 35 when they became involved; she was 16 -- was the inspiration for Vladimir Navokov's novel Lolita. And Chaplin was extremely rich: his and Grey's divorce, in 1927, set a record with its $825,000 settlement, plus a million bucks in legal fees.

Traci Ardren, an assistant professor of anthropology at the University of Miami, knows the Maya well. She has studied Classic Maya society for over 20 years while living in the modern Maya villages of Yaxuna, Chunchucmil, and Espita in the Mexican state of Yucatan. Her credentials include contributing to and editing Ancient Maya Women (2002) and The Social Experience of Childhood in Ancient Mesoamerica (2006). Ardren's reaction to the new film \"Apocalypto,\" follows. Scholars are well aware that some aspects of Maya culture were violent, but Ardren finds fault with what she sees as a pervasive colonial attitude in the film. With great trepidation I went to an advance screening of \"Apocalypto\" last night in Miami. No one really expects historical dramas to be accurate, so I was not so much concerned with whether or not the film would accurately represent what we know of Classic period Maya history as I was concerned about the message Mel Gibson wanted to convey through the film. After Jared Diamond's best-selling book Collapse, it has become fashionable to use the so-called Maya collapse as a metaphor for Western society's environmental and political excesses. Setting aside the fact that the Maya lived for more than a thousand years in a fragile tropical environment before their cities were abandoned, while here in the U.S, we have polluted our urban environments in less than 200, I anticipated a heavy-handed cautionary tale wrapped up in Native American costume. What I saw was much worse than this. The thrill of hearing melodic Yucatec Maya spoken by familiar faces (although the five lead actors are not Yucatec Maya but other talented Native American actors) during the first ten minutes of the movie is swiftly and brutally replaced with stomach churning panic at the graphic Maya-on-Maya violence depicted in a village raid scene of nearly 15 minutes. From then on the entire movie never ceases to utilize every possible excuse to depict more violence. It is unrelenting. Our hero, Jaguar Paw, played by the charismatic Cree actor Rudy Youngblood, has one hellavuh bad couple of days. Captured for sacrifice, forced to march to the putrid city nearby, he endures every tropical jungle attack conceivable and that is after he escapes the relentless brutality of the elites. I am told this part of the movie is completely derivative of the 1966 film \"The Naked Prey.\" Pure action flick, with one ridiculous encounter after another, filmed beautifully in the way that only Hollywood blockbusters can afford, this is the part of the movie that will draw in audiences and demonstrates Gibson's skill as a cinematic storyteller. But I find the visual appeal of the film one of the most disturbing aspects of \"Apocalypto.\" The jungles of Veracruz and Costa Rica have never looked better, the masked priests on the temple jump right off a Classic Maya vase, and the people are gorgeous. The fact that this film was made in Mexico and filmed in the Yucatec Maya language coupled with its visual appeal makes it all the more dangerous. It looks authentic; viewers will be captivated by the crazy, exotic mess of the city and the howler monkeys in the jungle. And who really cares that the Maya were not living in cities when the Spanish arrived? Yes, Gibson includes the arrival of clearly Christian missionaries (these guys are too clean to be conquistadors) in the last five minutes of the story (in the real world the Spanish arrived 300 years after the last Maya city was abandoned). It is one of the few calm moments in an otherwise aggressively paced film. The message? The end is near and the savior has come. Gibson's efforts at authenticity of location and language might, for some viewers, mask his blatantly colonial message that the Maya needed saving because they were rotten at the core. Using the decline of Classic urbanism as his backdrop, Gibson communicates that there was absolutely nothing redeemable about Maya culture, especially elite culture which is depicted as a disgusting feast of blood and excess. Before anyone thinks I have forgotten my Metamucil this morning, I am not a compulsively politically correct type who sees the Maya as the epitome of goodness and light. I know the Maya practiced brutal violence upon one another, and I have studied child sacrifice during the Classic period. But in \"Apocalypto,\" no mention is made of the achievements in science and art, the profound spirituality and connection to agricultural cycles, or the engineering feats of Maya cities. Instead, Gibson replays, in glorious big-budget technicolor, an offensive and racist notion that Maya people were brutal to one another long before the arrival of Europeans and thus they deserve, in fact they needed, rescue. This same idea was used for 500 years to justify the subjugation of Maya people and it has been thoroughly deconstructed and rejected by Maya intellectuals and community leaders throughout the Maya area today. In fact, Maya intellectuals have demonstrated convincingly that such ideas were manipulated by the Guatemalan army to justify the genocidal civil war of the 1970-1990s. To see this same trope about who indigenous people were (and are today?) used as the basis for entertainment (and I use the term loosely) is truly embarrassing. How can we continue to produce such one-sided and clearly exploitative messages about the indigenous people of the New World? I loved Gibson's film \"Braveheart,\" I really did. But there is something very different about portraying a group of people, who are now recovering from 500 years of colonization, as violent and brutal. These are people who are living with the very real effects of persistent racism that at its heart sees them as less than human. To think that a movie about the 1,000 ways a Maya can kill a Maya--when only 10 years ago Maya people were systematically being exterminated in Guatemala just for being Maya--is in any way okay, entertaining, or helpful is the epitome of a Western fantasy of supremacy that I find sad and ultimately pornographic. It is surely no surprise that \"Apolcalypto\" has very little to do with Maya culture and instead is Gibson's comment on the excesses he perceives in modern Western society. I just wish he had been honest enough to say this. Instead he has created a beautiful and disturbing portrait that satisfies his need for comment but does violence to one of the most impressive of Native American cultures.

The internet game was my preferred way of meeting Thai women back then. I was looking for a serious girlfriend and I didn't want someone from the naughty bars. Added to that, meeting Thai women in public places was a bit more difficult back then that it is now, so the internet was a fun and easy, no, make that very easy, way of meeting just the type of woman who appeals to a good percentage of Westerners in Thailand. One of the ladies I met online was Ploen. Ploen was a little different. Unlike most playing the internet game at that time, Ploen hailed from Ubon which was in contrast to most of the girls back then – we're talking the late '90s here, who were Bangkok girls. Ploen had come to Bangkok from Ubon for work, as many from the countryside do. I'll admit that my interest in meeting these ladies online was not always relationship-oriented, but then I was always straight with the women I chatted with and there were no broken promises, so hopefully no broken hearts. Ploen knew I was a bit of a naughty boy at the time I chatted with her, and told me straight that she was pure and innocent and was saving herself either for marriage, or at the very least, for the guy who she would eventually marry. The message was clear – you can have me, but you've got to marry me. I was cool with that, totally respected her and had no intention of lying to someone in such a position, so rather than meet her, we just chatted a lot online. Looking back, we really did have a nice online friendship. We would chat about our respective lives, from work related stuff to affairs of the heart. We never even spoke on the phone and we never met, even though we only lived a few kilometers apart. After some months of regular chat, often chatting for an hour or more a few times a week, we slowed down and eventually I stopped using ICQ altogether as online chat really can be a dreadful waste of time. That happened around the time I met Mrs. Stick, and the relationship with her was going well so my reasons for hanging out on ICQ were no longer valid. I largely forgot about Ploen. I uninstalled ICQ and so stopped using it altogether. All of my old ICQ friends became more and more distant memories. A couple of months back I was sitting at a computer with ICQ installed and tried to remember my old account number and password, and tried it on that computer. It worked, I was logged in, and guess who I happened to meet online. Ploen, of course. She immediately sent me a cute message saying that she hadn't forgotten about me which brought a smile to my face. I didn't have the time to chat, but was keen to hear how she was doing so I gave her my MSN Messenger ID and told her she would be more likely to see me there I logged off and again, I didn't think I would hear from her again. Within a few days I was logged into MSN Messenger and I see Ploen pop up online. She sends me a message and we spend the next hour chatting about how our lives had been over the past 4 years, the best estimate of the period since we had last chatted online. We also traded a couple of pics, her keen to see the wedding pics of Mrs. Stick and I. Soppy girls and all that nonsense. I told her that while it was nice to catch up with her, I didn't have the time to spend chatting with her online as we had in the past, and besides, I didn't feel it was right as a married man to chat at length with her. I told her that it was nice to catch up but that our paths probably shouldn't cross so regularly. I wished her all the best. Of course, the story doesn't finish there. This past week I was wandering through Siam Discovery Centre with a bit of time to kill before meeting a friend, when I see a very cute Thai girl clearly grinning at me. I did a double take, looked a bit closer, and realised that it was Ploen. I wandered over towards her and she started to run off! I stopped, not wanting to startle her. She stopped, turned around, and walked towards me with this huge grin on her face and gives me a deep wai. She was just like a dek barn-nok (a kid from the countryside). I asked her what she was doing and she said that she was just wandering around as it was her day off. I had 45 minutes to spare and offered to buy her a coffee. A big grin and off we went to Starbucks. Ploen told me more about her life, and I was to find out things I had never known before. Ploen told me more about her life in Ubon, in a village of about 200 – 300 people. She misses it immensely and not a day goes by when she longs to visit her family back home, something she only manages about twice a year. I never knew that Ploen had only studied until Bor 6, or grade 6. Her family never had the money to send her to high school as such a school did not exist in their village – she would have to have gone to the provincial capital which was 20 km away – and they just could not afford either the cost of transport, let alone the fees for the school. She reminisced about the school she did attend, and how she would go weeks without shoes, walking to school in the heat of summer in bare feet, just as many of her friends did. With little money in the family, her uniform was often threadbare and they didn't have the usual five sets of the same uniform, one for each day of the week, as many city kids do, rather having just one set which her mother washed every night and tried to get dry in time for the next day's lessons. Her excellent English – and it really is very good – defies the fact that she only has a grade 6 education. She has never been to language school and she has never had a foreign boyfriend. She has simply picked up the language through work. But I am getting ahead of myself. When she had completed grade 6, at age 12, her mother put the word out that Ploen wanted to work, and have the chance to make some money. No, thank God, it wasn't what you think… One of the neighbours mentioned that they had a friend in Bangkok who was looking for a maid so young Ploen, now just 12 years old, left her family in Ubon, and as a fresh faced country girl was sent off to work for a family in Bangkok. The family took her in, treated her as one of their own, and Ploen says they were always very kind to her. She was paid what she at the time felt was a huge amount of money, 800 baht a month. Yeah, you read that right, eight hundred baht a month. Given the dreadful poverty she had come from, this was a small fortune. The first pay check was sent straight to Mum in its entirety, as after all, everything was provided for Ploen at her employer's residence and she had no expenses whatsoever. For the first several months, every single baht she earned was sent home to the family. Over time her salary was increased, but it never reached 3,000 baht a month, not 100 baht a day. And she worked every day. She never had a day off, at least not officially. Ploen worked for the family as a maid for 3 years before becoming bored of it. It was hard work but that wasn't what bothered her. It was tedious and boring and she wanted a new challenge. The family who she worked for saw her potential and Ploen was sent to one of the family's businesses where she was employed as a telephone operator. During this time she was literally forced to pick up English. A couple of years in that role and she had become bored again. At 17 years old she had already had 5 years full-time work experience. She felt that she had picked up English to a reasonable level. It was around this time that some of Ploen's friends from the village started coming to Bangkok to work in, as she calls them, \"other places\". Barely of legal age, they were making the big money that is possible in such venues. Ploen started hearing stories from her mother about how her friends had been taking Western guys back to their village, many, many guys in the cases of some girls. Many of these girls eventually got married, young girls marrying guys old enough to be their grandfather – her words, not mine! Despite the fact that she was brought up in exactly the same village and educated to the same level at the same school, Ploen refused to consider this type of work. She was still only making a very modest amount of money and she could have done oh so well in the industry, she really could have. A little more on that later. So when Ploen's friends were discovering the bright lights of Bangkok and Pattaya, and being taken on holidays all around the country, Ploen was transferred to yet another of the family's company businesses, a well-known travel agency. There was a lot to learn, with everything from country codes to airline codes to airport codes before she even got into things like itineraries, visas, and the computerised booking system. She was given some basic on the job training and managed to get on top of it. The ultimate Thai dating site with ladies from all over Thailand! This time Ploen found the challenge that she had always been looking for. She has worked at the travel agency for 11 years now, and is the most senior travel agent. She boasts to me that she now earns more than most people her age who went to university. While she wouldn't tell me how much she earned exactly, she hinted that it was around 25,000 baht a month. Even some people with a Master's degree don't make that sort of money, she positively squealed. And on top of that, she has a job she loves. But it is not just the money that is good. She gets free international travel. Last year she had three separate trips. This year she has had two so far. Last year she went both Down Under and to Europe. And what I found truly amazing, is that on the trip to Europe she went alone. Her boss told her that traveling alone would allow her to experience what it is like to travel from a new perspective. She loves travel and told me how this year she has already been to Europe and is planning her next trip later in the year. All of this is paid for by her place of work. This effectively means that her salary is around 50,000 baht a month, more than most Western English teachers in Bangkok. Ploen could have taken the easy way out many years ago. She comes from exactly the same background as many of the bargirls, but that was never an option. Many of her school friends went into the bars. But she never even considered that. She rolled her sleeves up, has worked very hard and has gone on to do very well for herself. This is a young woman with a huge amount of pride. More than that, she still very much has that joy for life that you see in youngsters in the northeast. I don't blame the bargirls for making the choices they do, especially those who fall pregnant at a young age and are abandoned by the father of the child. They are in an awful situation and their options aren't great. But there are a lot of women who enter the profession in Thailand out of laziness – and these girls are hard to admire. Ploen is a wonderful example of how women from the Thai countryside with a very modest education CAN make it. She has worked hard and now has a well-paid job that she loves. She has her pride well and truly in tact and when she meets a nice farang man – she is looking for someone right now – she is going to make someone very, very happy. Oh, by the way, she is seriously cute! Where WAS THIS PICTURE taken? It was the construction near MBK. Where is that?! Last week's picture was taken of the construction site at the Patumwan intersection, opposite MBK. This week's picture is also in Bangkok. The first person to tell me where the picture is wins a 500 baht credit at Tony's Bar in Soi Cowboy. The second person to get the prize right gets a 500 baht credit at Oh My Cod, the British Cafe in the Khao Sarn Road area. The third and forth prizes are a 500 baht credit at Sin in Sukhumvit Soi 4. I am pleased to announce that I have found a prize provider in Pattaya, and am thrilled that it is my favourite bar in Pattaya, Catz. The prizes are only available to people in Thailand now – either residents or tourists, and must be redeemed within 2 weeks. You MUST say that you are in Bangkok and able to claim the prize or I will consider you ineligible. If you have a preference as to which prize you would prefer, do not be shy to let me know! Also, if you are in Pattaya, please let me know so you can be eligible for that prize! FROM STICKMAN'S EMAIL INBOX Loud? Mai pen rai! This evening I accompanied the spouse for a stroll around Rama 9 Park, which really is a magnificent place. But it is liberally dotted with loudspeakers and they were playing a radio talk show at high volume. Why? As the sound faded from one speaker as you walked along so you entered the range of the next. Very clever, but why? Then we ran into the evening aerobics class and their loud disco music. I strongly believe that Thais hate silence because then they might have to use their brain to think, and that's probably a difficult process for many. Be careful with hotel room safes! A reader speculated that a hotel technician must have opened a room safe with a master key. There is another way to get into it, however. Years ago, a bellhop at a Sukhumvit Road hotel was arrested for breaking into the room safes. The newspaper did not identify the hotel further, but this guy confessed and said he got the idea from watching the old \"McGyver\" television show from the US. What he did was smear a thin layer of his \"nose oil\", as the newspaper termed it, onto the entire keypad. Later, when guests left the room for the first time, he simply went in and could see which numbers on the pad had been pressed and kept trying different combinations of only those numbers until it worked. It didn't take long. So remember, always wipe the keypad on your in-room safe clean when you check in! How secure are hotel safes? One of your readers gave the advice in this week's column not to use the room safes where you have to program you own personal code, but instead to use the safes at the reception where it takes two keys to open them, one in the possession of the reception and one in your own possession. But these safes are even more vulnerable. The first type of safes can indeed be opened with a master key. There's usually a hidden keyhole behind some sort of button or logo. This key is usually in the possession of the manager. But always remember that the second type of safes can be opened with keys that have been used by a lot of other people before you. If the safe is not rented out the key is at the reception counter, usually accessible by all of the reception staff. It's easy to copy (especially because of the fact that in Thailand the keys used are mostly not the most decent ones). That can be either the reception staff or the guest who used it before you. Be also aware that there are spare keys of these keys too. As a hotel owner myself, I know that having a stressed guest in your reception who is checking out in a hurry and has to catch a plane, but lost his safe key with his passport, ticket and money in the safe, can cause quite some problems. Keeping a careful eye on who you hire is more important, because the hotel safe that guarantees you 100% that your stuff won't be stolen does not exist! Friendly Immigration officers. Over the past six years, I have made at least 30 visits to Thailand from the neighboring region, mostly for a few days or at most two weeks. This summer, I overstayed by two days and was prepared to pay the fine at the airport. At the immigration desk, I was sent to secondary where an officer leafed through my passport, looked at me, made a notation under my entry stamp, stamped me out, and returned the passport to me with a smile. I'd like to think I got credit for being a frequent visitor who had never previously overstayed. Whatever the reason was (a clean shirt with a collar?), it meant I departed with a renewed love for the country I plan to re-locate to in several years. So are there any kids called buffalo out there? Your wife should be able to explain but many Asian cultures believe that being too proud of beauty / smarts etc. as a child means the ghosts will get jealous and take them away. It's one of the reasons there are nicknames for children which are often derogatory in nature. Parents will choose a good name for their children, but they won't use the proper name when they're kids. Instead, they use the derogatory nickname to prevent spirits from being jealous. It's a common feature in Chinese culture, which Thai culture is heavily influenced by. What an ugly baby! I read in a book before I came to Thailand (maybe Culture Shock Thailand) that when shown a baby you were supposed to say it was ugly, that was to trick the evil spirits into looking elsewhere for a baby to steal. However, when I came here and asked a few Thai people they looked blank and weren't aware of such a custom. Probably best to play it safe and call them all narak. More ugly babies. Years ago I was astonished to learn that well-wishers who come to see someone's new baby girl would say, \"Oh, what an ugly child!\" in order to confuse any ghost that might be present, also. It's not unusual to see women in air-conned banks wearing their sweaters backwards for the same reason. I once met a very tall Thai lady in Pattaya whose name was Lek (short). I guess her mother didn't want any ghosts raising hell with her daughter. Yeah, Thais have some very interesting superstitions. Soi Cowboy was ground zero last Sunday night for a Hollywood movie crew. They were filming “Big Hit In Bangkok” which stars Nicholas Cage. Apparently the script called for Patpong but it was too crowded to shoot with the vendors up to the curb, so instead Cowboy became Patpong. When Nicolas Cage was done doing his thing in front of the camera, I wonder if he had a chance to check out that particular neighbourhood? There were notices up in English saying that filming was taking place and that anyone who walked beyond the signs could be caught on film – and that footage could end up in the movie. What was also interesting is that they absolved themselves of any liability through this notice. So, is anyone going to be a willing (or unwilling) punter in the background? Sounds like bragging rights to me, to say that you could be seen in the background of a Hollywood movie shot in Cowboy. And while Soi Cowboy could never be mistaken for Pattaya, it is good to see that a number of the bars are competing on price. Yep, not everyone in Bangkok is on a fat expat salary. Many bars have boards outside offering beer at affordable prices, especially before 9:00 PM when 40 baht beers can be easily found! In last week's column it was mentioned that girls at The Dollhouse in Soi Cowboy were dancing on stage in their jeans. This sight can only be seen on Thursday nights. I stuck my head in the Thermae last night for the first time in a long time, and I was glad I did. This legendary Bangkok night spot has turned itself around big time, and I was amazed at how much improved it was from my last visit, which was quite some time ago. The crowd the bar attracts appears to be quite different these days, if last night was anything to go by. For anyone who had given up on the Thermae a long time ago, you may well find it worth a look again. Morning Night in Sukhumvit Soi 4 has a banner advertising their 4th anniversary party this Thursday, 25th August, But no idea what they are offering – free drinks, food, who knows what?! In an unusual twist, Superstar in Patpong has hired a Vietnamese dancer who has really enhanced the line-up. At this point in time she is just dancing and doesn't leave with customers. She is a hit with lady customers with all the Thai women ogling her fair complexion and other assets, but her dancing colleagues do not seem to be welcoming the newcomer with open arms as they now have to try to keep up with her energetic dance moves. The bad news from Superstar is that the mamasan is throwing her weight around using a piercing police whistle to summon tardy dancers up on stage. There is nothing worse then sitting comfortably, enjoying the surroundings while sipping your favorite drink only to have your serenity blasted by this nutter sneaking up behind you and blasting your eardrums with her whistle. In a continuing trend, the music at many bars at the Pong has again been raised to jet plane taking off level again. Is there some private music volume contest that the DJs are all secretly competing against each other in? There is one DJ who rotates through several bars and is forever playing his tunes MUCH louder than even the most egregious violator of sane volume levels. Even after being told by the Thai owner of the bar several times turn down the music, the DJ merely waits a few minutes and it is right back up to ear splitting level again. A close friend of the owner asked why this guy is still working even after nightly warnings to turn down the music and the owner said \"cannot fire him\". Sounds like it could be another pissing contest, like we saw in a Pattaya bar recently. The big rumour of the week is that Club Eden, one Bangkok venue which has a very popular following – and a legion of satisfied customers, will be opening a new venue in Pattaya. Club Eden Pattaya *is* coming soon. In recent times a few readers have mentioned to me the lack of news from nightlife venues in Bangkok. There are two reasons for this, the first and foremost being that I do not go out in Bangkok as much as I did, and secondly, that things here have been a bit static. In terms of the nightlife, much more happens in Pattaya, hence I often have much more news from down there. And this week was no exception. I made the effort to get around all of the Bangkok nightlife areas, and most were quiet… Club Boesche in Pattaya seems to be in the news a lot recently, and it is not hard to see why. It is doing a brisk trade with many attractive ladies on the premises. Anyway, a friend was in there recently and barfined a young lady, early 20s, who he found to be extremely attractive. They went back to his hotel room and she went into the shower while he waited for the main event. Several minutes later she came out and he looked at her. Something was different. She then went and put something into a glass beside the bed. False teeth! To say the mood was killed would be a major understatement. Management of X Zone confirm that the bar is not for sale. X Zone A Gogo, at more than 250 square metres, is a big place and this means that the club can have an empty feeling at the beginning of the night. This is why they are going to make a major upgrade to the entrance and part of the club, providing a premier 'beach stage' which is due to open on October 1st. Another Bangkok bar can be added to the list of good spots to watch the Tri-Nations rugby this year. Remember, UBC no longer shows the rugby so you have to go somewhere which has either the Supersport feed from South Africa or the Australian Broadcasting feed. The Down Under Bar in Sukhumvit Soi 7/1 is attracting big crowds to watch the game with close to 100 rugby fans watching New Zealand put Australia to the sword yesterday (sorry, couldn't resist). The year-old Casino Club is staging a Coyote contest and Coyotee’s is staging a caboose contest. The Coyote Dance Contest at Casino gets underway at 10 PM tonight. Cash prizes are expected to lure an impressive line-up of dancers from near and far who, in turn, should lure a good number of oglers. Next week, the same Soi Diamond club will host a bash to celebrate its first anniversary. Competing for punters that night (Sunday, August 27), Coyotee’s will again give away money in what is shaping up as its monthly ass competition. In search of the best behind in Pattaya, the Soi Marina Plaza A Gogo is inviting ladies to shake and show their derrieres to a panel of judges and a club full of ass men. Last month’s contest was a huge success. This weekend, Fun Town nightspots were forced to tone down their antics due to an invasion of the men in brown. Nearly 100 Bangkok cops stormed into town on Thursday night reportedly to boost the moral standards of the city (and perhaps boost their incomes). Inspections began in North Pattaya and spread south to Walking Street. Not unlike most Pattaya punters, the police were in search of nudity and sex shows; their efforts were wasted. Tipped off in advance, most clubs arranged for dancers and showgirls to be fully clothed by the time police arrived; in better-connected clubs it was business as usual. Plods also checked IDs, to ensure no minors were working in or patronising nightspots, and that doors were shut before 2 AM. By Saturday, the boys in brown had returned to Bangkok and all was back to normal. The new Broadway seems to be the late Broadway. No official word, but the overpriced Soi BJ A Gogo has been dark lately and rumour has it that it is yet one more low-season fatality. But fear not, another gogo bar has been launched to fill the non-existent gap. The new Highway Star opened this week on the upper level of the Pier Entertainment center – just a few meters short of Walking Street. A large, brightly lit venue, the club has about two dozen dancers who do little to improve the appearance of the vast stage or the discomfort of the tiered bench-seating. There were even fewer punters Saturday night. Drink prices are more attractive than the dancers. A popular website, Pattaya Secrets, is about to launch a bar, nightclub and hotel. Secrets Bar plans a grand opening bash on September 1. Tucked away on Soi 14 off of Walking Street, the large hostess club will feature a broad variety of reasonably priced drinks and beers. Secrets Hotel, on that same site, is scheduled to open its 24 rooms on three floors at the end of next month. OK, so this is not exclusive to Bangkok, but I thought it was funny nonetheless. A certain bunch of people staying at a certain newly opened top-end hotel in Sukhumvit are causing the management all sorts of problems. They stay in the bigger rooms, usually the suites, and at some time during their stay they go out to the market and buy cheap sets of sheets and pillows. They take these back to the hotel and swap them with the good stuff the hotel uses. When they go to check out, all of the good stuff is packed away in their luggage. The management has become aware of the problem and when this lot check out the chambermaids have to verify that the bedding is the good stuff! Don't worry, if you're farang, you won't be suspected of this. It's another lot up to this trick. 45 teachers are needed for a special teaching project. This could be one way to find out if the teaching industry in Thailand is for you. You'll get paid $3,000, get a FREE TESOL certificate worth $1,590 & take a 5-month adventure holiday in Thailand. The scheduled program dates are 25 September 2006 through to 28 February 2007. Anyone interested should plan to arrive no later than 23 September. The benefits include free airport pick up from Bangkok and transfer to school, a TESOL certificate course from one of the world’s largest course providers, – TEFL International, beginning 25 September in Ban Phe. You get to work in a school in Thailand for 4 months earning 30,000 baht per month + housing. There are many locations to choose from all over Thailand. You can apply online here where you will have to pay $200 as a non-refundable deposit. This is open to native English speakers from the following countries only – USA, Canada, UK, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa. Ko Samui and particularly Ko Phangan are two islands very popular with young Israeli tourists – who have often just finished their military service. This year a lot of Lebanese from Sydney, Australia, decided against returning to their homeland for holidays and went to the south of Thailand instead. I just hope they didn't go to Samui or Phangan or there might have been some fireworks. A reader has a suggestion about the 90 day reporting or any other immigration problem that people might have. If you go to the one-stop office of the labor and immigration departments, located next to the labor department, you will find an empty room with some officials who seemingly have few customers during the day. No waiting. At least, said reader reports he has never had to wait and has never seen anyone else there. Depending on where you are, the location may be more convenient than the Suan Plu location. It's a short bus ride from (and a short walk from the bus stop) Victory Monument. I was at a flash hotel buffet recently and can you believe it, they charged for water? I will not shame the establishment in question, but thought this to be a bit questionable. What will be next – charging you to use their knives and forks?! And let’s clarify this, it was standard Thailand bottled water, the sort of water that goes for 5 baht a bottle, not the likes that is imported from the alps of France. Hmmm… It looks like the cost of petrol in Thailand is not just hitting the locals, but hitting farangs too. In the last week two guys I know have made the decision to get their vehicle converted so as to be able to run it on gas, and not just petrol. The conversion costs around 20,000 baht, and once converted, the vehicle can run on gas, which goes for less than 10 baht a litre, compared to petrol, which is currently around the 30 baht a litre mark. Quote of the week overheard in a bar. \"You farang have big money, why you have ugly girl?!\" In this week's news link, a suspected killer in the US flees to and hides out in Thailand. And another report with a hugely erroneous quote. \"The new visa allowed Mr. Karr to live and work in Bangkok, the capital of Asia's sex trade and a haven for thousands of Western pedophiles, without the need for three-monthly visa runs.\" More on all of his at the end of the column. Fox News' headline will not please anyone in Thailand with them titling a video news report on the whole incident, \"Pedophile Paradise\". Within seconds of the video clip beginning they talk about what they call Thailand's \"lucrative child sex industry\", calling it a billion dollar industry. With hugely erroneous information, they talked about 4 or 5 year olds being trafficked in and out of Bangkok. WTF?! They said these children get taken to the painter bars in Washington Square in downtown Bangkok. This was what they said. They obviously mean the bars of Sukhumvit Soi 33. Well, I have never seen, nor heard of any ladies under 18 there – in fact most are much older. And when they mention Washington Square, hell, in some bars the average age of the bargirls is older than me – and I'm no spring chicken! It is all a load of complete and utter BULLSHIT. They then go on to speculate that the only reason that people go to Thailand is for the sex industry. This is without a doubt the worst, most inaccurate report I have EVER heard about the subject of prostitution in Thailand. A disgrace from Fox News. Talk in the press is that there will be extra steps put in place to check the background of foreigners applying for teaching jobs in Thailand. The checks they refer to are checks with the local police here in Thailand, which would presumably only show up any offences committed here in Thailand, and it is therefore unlikely that anything would be revealed. I mean, if someone had committed a serious crime in Thailand then they almost certainly would have been deported from the country already and wouldn't be there in the first place. And contacting authorities in the West won't result in any info being divulged with most countries having fairly strong privacy laws in place. It all seems rather flawed to me. On top of this, what they do need to be careful of is that there is already so much paperwork and red tape already. Add to that the fact that salaries paid to foreigners teaching here really are on the low side. If they make it much more difficult for foreigners to teach in Thailand then it will just become too much of a chore and teachers will go elsewhere. Thailand needs foreign teachers. While every effort should be made to prevent people not suited to the industry from teaching, this has to be managed very carefully. Ask the Sticks Mrs. Stick is here to answer questions surrounding anything that confuses you in Thailand, particularly issues of the heart. Please note that for general bargirl related questions, Mr. Stick might answer them. Please do try and limit the length of questions to Mrs. Stick to about 100 words. We get many questions that are entire stories of several hundred words which I'm afraid are just too long to run here. Question 1: Over the last 6 months, my Isaan girlfriend of almost 2 years has been living with me in my homeland. During this time she became pregnant. When we returned to Thailand, she insisted that I return with her to her home village, to meet the parents, etc. During this visit, a ceremony was arranged that she could only describe as a 'good luck ceremony'. We sat by a thing that looked like a small Christmas tree, with hundreds of pieces of white string hung on it. A man arrived that I hadn't seen before and started speaking a lot and doing things that I can't really remember, but during this time, her father stuffed some money in his shirt pocket. After this, everyone in the room, probably three quarters of the village, came over and took the strands of string and tied one on my wrist and another on my girlfriend's wrist. At the end I had 50 – 60 pieces of string tied on me. Once the ceremony was over the food came out and we all sat and ate. The men then disappeared downstairs to open the truckload of Thai whiskey I had bought a few days before. My question is, what did it all mean? Are we married? I certainly didn't sign anything but I did kick in the seemingly statutory 100K ' sin sot' just to keep the peace. Mrs. Stick says: I cannot understand some guys who send questions to me. You go to a ceremony and pay what really is a lot of money, go through a major ceremony, and then later send me an email asking me what it was all about? Are you crazy? What you just went through was a spiritual exorcising ceremony, a ceremony where your girlfriend must have told someone in her family that you are the spawn of the devil and that these spirits need to be exorcised from you. Ok, I'll be serious now. What you went through is effectively an engagement ceremony. You are now engaged. Congratulations. Question 2: I have a great girlfriend. I trust her, and she has her own business, her own car, and her own money. She comes from a good family. If we get married, she told me that I would probably be expected to give a dowry of around one million baht. She said that unlike a middle-class or poor family that would keep the dowry to help the family, the dowry that I paid would be invested by her father for our future. He would give it back to us within a year. I do trust her, but in your opinion, is this a reasonable dowry, and do you think that if the family is already wealthy, her father would likely give it back to us? They already have a house and several cars worth at least a million baht anyway. I'm not rich, and a million baht is about all I have. Mrs. Stick says: From the way you describe the family, one million baht may be a fair amount for them to expect to be paid for the dowry for their daughter. If your girlfriend was to marry a Thai man I am guessing that this is the same amount they would ask for from him. However, you say that that is all the money you have. You should not be asked to give more than you can afford. I recommend that when you have the meeting to formally discuss this that you take along a senior Thai friend or colleague who knows your situation well and who can talk on your behalf. We are all feeling like a bunch of scum at the moment, with what is being said about us in some corners of the errant Western press. Bangkok is once again getting a really bad rap, and the generalisations are flowing fast. Sure, Bangkok is far from perfect and there are some mighty unusual, and even some downright questionable things that not just take place here, but are the norm, but for sure, when so-called respected Western newswires say that the city is home to thousands of Western pedophiles they really are speaking out of their backside. The line between the sex industry and child sex is being blurred and they are lumping it all together. It needs to be put on record that the vast majority of Westerners in Bangkok despise pedophiles as much as anyone, and what is being said in the press here about Bangkok being a pedophile paradise and the proliferation of Western pedophiles here is a complete and utter misrepresentation.

All rights reserved. © Stickman 1998-2022 stickmanbangkok@gmail.com Stickman's Weekly Column › August 20th, 2006 The Story Of Ploen Many years ago I played the internet game, that is, I spent a lot of time in cyberspace chatting up Thai ladies. The internet game was my preferred way of meeting Thai women back then. I was looking for a serious girlfriend and I didn't want someone from the naughty bars. Added to that, meeting Thai women in public places was a bit more difficult back then that it is now, so the internet was a fun and easy, no, make that very easy, way of meeting just the type of woman who appeals to a good percentage of Westerners in Thailand. One of the ladies I met online was Ploen. Ploen was a little different. Unlike most playing the internet game at that time, Ploen hailed from Ubon which was in contrast to most of the girls back then – we're talking the late '90s here, who were Bangkok girls. Ploen had come to Bangkok from Ubon for work, as many from the countryside do. I'll admit that my interest in meeting these ladies online was not always relationship-oriented, but then I was always straight with the women I chatted with and there were no broken promises, so hopefully no broken hearts. Ploen knew I was a bit of a naughty boy at the time I chatted with her, and told me straight that she was pure and innocent and was saving herself either for marriage, or at the very least, for the guy who she would eventually marry. The message was clear – you can have me, but you've got to marry me. I was cool with that, totally respected her and had no intention of lying to someone in such a position, so rather than meet her, we just chatted a lot online. Looking back, we really did have a nice online friendship. We would chat about our respective lives, from work related stuff to affairs of the heart. We never even spoke on the phone and we never met, even though we only lived a few kilometers apart. After some months of regular chat, often chatting for an hour or more a few times a week, we slowed down and eventually I stopped using ICQ altogether as online chat really can be a dreadful waste of time. That happened around the time I met Mrs. Stick, and the relationship with her was going well so my reasons for hanging out on ICQ were no longer valid. I largely forgot about Ploen. I uninstalled ICQ and so stopped using it altogether. All of my old ICQ friends became more and more distant memories. A couple of months back I was sitting at a computer with ICQ installed and tried to remember my old account number and password, and tried it on that computer. It worked, I was logged in, and guess who I happened to meet online. Ploen, of course. She immediately sent me a cute message saying that she hadn't forgotten about me which brought a smile to my face. I didn't have the time to chat, but was keen to hear how she was doing so I gave her my MSN Messenger ID and told her she would be more likely to see me there I logged off and again, I didn't think I would hear from her again. Within a few days I was logged into MSN Messenger and I see Ploen pop up online. She sends me a message and we spend the next hour chatting about how our lives had been over the past 4 years, the best estimate of the period since we had last chatted online. We also traded a couple of pics, her keen to see the wedding pics of Mrs. Stick and I. Soppy girls and all that nonsense. I told her that while it was nice to catch up with her, I didn't have the time to spend chatting with her online as we had in the past, and besides, I didn't feel it was right as a married man to chat at length with her. I told her that it was nice to catch up but that our paths probably shouldn't cross so regularly. I wished her all the best. Of course, the story doesn't finish there. This past week I was wandering through Siam Discovery Centre with a bit of time to kill before meeting a friend, when I see a very cute Thai girl clearly grinning at me. I did a double take, looked a bit closer, and realised that it was Ploen. I wandered over towards her and she started to run off! I stopped, not wanting to startle her. She stopped, turned around, and walked towards me with this huge grin on her face and gives me a deep wai. She was just like a dek barn-nok (a kid from the countryside). I asked her what she was doing and she said that she was just wandering around as it was her day off. I had 45 minutes to spare and offered to buy her a coffee. A big grin and off we went to Starbucks. Ploen told me more about her life, and I was to find out things I had never known before. Ploen told me more about her life in Ubon, in a village of about 200 – 300 people. She misses it immensely and not a day goes by when she longs to visit her family back home, something she only manages about twice a year. I never knew that Ploen had only studied until Bor 6, or grade 6. Her family never had the money to send her to high school as such a school did not exist in their village – she would have to have gone to the provincial capital which was 20 km away – and they just could not afford either the cost of transport, let alone the fees for the school. She reminisced about the school she did attend, and how she would go weeks without shoes, walking to school in the heat of summer in bare feet, just as many of her friends did. With little money in the family, her uniform was often threadbare and they didn't have the usual five sets of the same uniform, one for each day of the week, as many city kids do, rather having just one set which her mother washed every night and tried to get dry in time for the next day's lessons. Her excellent English – and it really is very good – defies the fact that she only has a grade 6 education. She has never been to language school and she has never had a foreign boyfriend. She has simply picked up the language through work. But I am getting ahead of myself. When she had completed grade 6, at age 12, her mother put the word out that Ploen wanted to work, and have the chance to make some money. No, thank God, it wasn't what you think… One of the neighbours mentioned that they had a friend in Bangkok who was looking for a maid so young Ploen, now just 12 years old, left her family in Ubon, and as a fresh faced country girl was sent off to work for a family in Bangkok. The family took her in, treated her as one of their own, and Ploen says they were always very kind to her. She was paid what she at the time felt was a huge amount of money, 800 baht a month. Yeah, you read that right, eight hundred baht a month. Given the dreadful poverty she had come from, this was a small fortune. The first pay check was sent straight to Mum in its entirety, as after all, everything was provided for Ploen at her employer's residence and she had no expenses whatsoever. For the first several months, every single baht she earned was sent home to the family. Over time her salary was increased, but it never reached 3,000 baht a month, not 100 baht a day. And she worked every day. She never had a day off, at least not officially. Ploen worked for the family as a maid for 3 years before becoming bored of it. It was hard work but that wasn't what bothered her. It was tedious and boring and she wanted a new challenge. The family who she worked for saw her potential and Ploen was sent to one of the family's businesses where she was employed as a telephone operator. During this time she was literally forced to pick up English. A couple of years in that role and she had become bored again. At 17 years old she had already had 5 years full-time work experience. She felt that she had picked up English to a reasonable level. It was around this time that some of Ploen's friends from the village started coming to Bangkok to work in, as she calls them, \"other places\". Barely of legal age, they were making the big money that is possible in such venues. Ploen started hearing stories from her mother about how her friends had been taking Western guys back to their village, many, many guys in the cases of some girls. Many of these girls eventually got married, young girls marrying guys old enough to be their grandfather – her words, not mine! Despite the fact that she was brought up in exactly the same village and educated to the same level at the same school, Ploen refused to consider this type of work. She was still only making a very modest amount of money and she could have done oh so well in the industry, she really could have. A little more on that later. So when Ploen's friends were discovering the bright lights of Bangkok and Pattaya, and being taken on holidays all around the country, Ploen was transferred to yet another of the family's company businesses, a well-known travel agency. There was a lot to learn, with everything from country codes to airline codes to airport codes before she even got into things like itineraries, visas, and the computerised booking system. She was given some basic on the job training and managed to get on top of it. The ultimate Thai dating site with ladies from all over Thailand! This time Ploen found the challenge that she had always been looking for. She has worked at the travel agency for 11 years now, and is the most senior travel agent. She boasts to me that she now earns more than most people her age who went to university. While she wouldn't tell me how much she earned exactly, she hinted that it was around 25,000 baht a month. Even some people with a Master's degree don't make that sort of money, she positively squealed. And on top of that, she has a job she loves. But it is not just the money that is good. She gets free international travel. Last year she had three separate trips. This year she has had two so far. Last year she went both Down Under and to Europe. And what I found truly amazing, is that on the trip to Europe she went alone. Her boss told her that traveling alone would allow her to experience what it is like to travel from a new perspective. She loves travel and told me how this year she has already been to Europe and is planning her next trip later in the year. All of this is paid for by her place of work. This effectively means that her salary is around 50,000 baht a month, more than most Western English teachers in Bangkok. Ploen could have taken the easy way out many years ago. She comes from exactly the same background as many of the bargirls, but that was never an option. Many of her school friends went into the bars. But she never even considered that. She rolled her sleeves up, has worked very hard and has gone on to do very well for herself. This is a young woman with a huge amount of pride. More than that, she still very much has that joy for life that you see in youngsters in the northeast. I don't blame the bargirls for making the choices they do, especially those who fall pregnant at a young age and are abandoned by the father of the child. They are in an awful situation and their options aren't great. But there are a lot of women who enter the profession in Thailand out of laziness – and these girls are hard to admire. Ploen is a wonderful example of how women from the Thai countryside with a very modest education CAN make it. She has worked hard and now has a well-paid job that she loves. She has her pride well and truly in tact and when she meets a nice farang man – she is looking for someone right now – she is going to make someone very, very happy. Oh, by the way, she is seriously cute! Where WAS THIS PICTURE taken? It was the construction near MBK. Where is that?! Last week's picture was taken of the construction site at the Patumwan intersection, opposite MBK. This week's picture is also in Bangkok. The first person to tell me where the picture is wins a 500 baht credit at Tony's Bar in Soi Cowboy. The second person to get the prize right gets a 500 baht credit at Oh My Cod, the British Cafe in the Khao Sarn Road area. The third and forth prizes are a 500 baht credit at Sin in Sukhumvit Soi 4. I am pleased to announce that I have found a prize provider in Pattaya, and am thrilled that it is my favourite bar in Pattaya, Catz. The prizes are only available to people in Thailand now – either residents or tourists, and must be redeemed within 2 weeks. You MUST say that you are in Bangkok and able to claim the prize or I will consider you ineligible. If you have a preference as to which prize you would prefer, do not be shy to let me know! Also, if you are in Pattaya, please let me know so you can be eligible for that prize! FROM STICKMAN'S EMAIL INBOX Loud? Mai pen rai! This evening I accompanied the spouse for a stroll around Rama 9 Park, which really is a magnificent place. But it is liberally dotted with loudspeakers and they were playing a radio talk show at high volume. Why? As the sound faded from one speaker as you walked along so you entered the range of the next. Very clever, but why? Then we ran into the evening aerobics class and their loud disco music. I strongly believe that Thais hate silence because then they might have to use their brain to think, and that's probably a difficult process for many. Be careful with hotel room safes! A reader speculated that a hotel technician must have opened a room safe with a master key. There is another way to get into it, however. Years ago, a bellhop at a Sukhumvit Road hotel was arrested for breaking into the room safes. The newspaper did not identify the hotel further, but this guy confessed and said he got the idea from watching the old \"McGyver\" television show from the US. What he did was smear a thin layer of his \"nose oil\", as the newspaper termed it, onto the entire keypad. Later, when guests left the room for the first time, he simply went in and could see which numbers on the pad had been pressed and kept trying different combinations of only those numbers until it worked. It didn't take long. So remember, always wipe the keypad on your in-room safe clean when you check in! How secure are hotel safes? One of your readers gave the advice in this week's column not to use the room safes where you have to program you own personal code, but instead to use the safes at the reception where it takes two keys to open them, one in the possession of the reception and one in your own possession. But these safes are even more vulnerable. The first type of safes can indeed be opened with a master key. There's usually a hidden keyhole behind some sort of button or logo. This key is usually in the possession of the manager. But always remember that the second type of safes can be opened with keys that have been used by a lot of other people before you. If the safe is not rented out the key is at the reception counter, usually accessible by all of the reception staff. It's easy to copy (especially because of the fact that in Thailand the keys used are mostly not the most decent ones). That can be either the reception staff or the guest who used it before you. Be also aware that there are spare keys of these keys too. As a hotel owner myself, I know that having a stressed guest in your reception who is checking out in a hurry and has to catch a plane, but lost his safe key with his passport, ticket and money in the safe, can cause quite some problems. Keeping a careful eye on who you hire is more important, because the hotel safe that guarantees you 100% that your stuff won't be stolen does not exist! Friendly Immigration officers. Over the past six years, I have made at least 30 visits to Thailand from the neighboring region, mostly for a few days or at most two weeks. This summer, I overstayed by two days and was prepared to pay the fine at the airport. At the immigration desk, I was sent to secondary where an officer leafed through my passport, looked at me, made a notation under my entry stamp, stamped me out, and returned the passport to me with a smile. I'd like to think I got credit for being a frequent visitor who had never previously overstayed. Whatever the reason was (a clean shirt with a collar?), it meant I departed with a renewed love for the country I plan to re-locate to in several years. So are there any kids called buffalo out there? Your wife should be able to explain but many Asian cultures believe that being too proud of beauty / smarts etc. as a child means the ghosts will get jealous and take them away. It's one of the reasons there are nicknames for children which are often derogatory in nature. Parents will choose a good name for their children, but they won't use the proper name when they're kids. Instead, they use the derogatory nickname to prevent spirits from being jealous. It's a common feature in Chinese culture, which Thai culture is heavily influenced by. What an ugly baby! I read in a book before I came to Thailand (maybe Culture Shock Thailand) that when shown a baby you were supposed to say it was ugly, that was to trick the evil spirits into looking elsewhere for a baby to steal. However, when I came here and asked a few Thai people they looked blank and weren't aware of such a custom. Probably best to play it safe and call them all narak. More ugly babies. Years ago I was astonished to learn that well-wishers who come to see someone's new baby girl would say, \"Oh, what an ugly child!\" in order to confuse any ghost that might be present, also. It's not unusual to see women in air-conned banks wearing their sweaters backwards for the same reason. I once met a very tall Thai lady in Pattaya whose name was Lek (short). I guess her mother didn't want any ghosts raising hell with her daughter. Yeah, Thais have some very interesting superstitions. Soi Cowboy was ground zero last Sunday night for a Hollywood movie crew. They were filming “Big Hit In Bangkok” which stars Nicholas Cage. Apparently the script called for Patpong but it was too crowded to shoot with the vendors up to the curb, so instead Cowboy became Patpong. When Nicolas Cage was done doing his thing in front of the camera, I wonder if he had a chance to check out that particular neighbourhood? There were notices up in English saying that filming was taking place and that anyone who walked beyond the signs could be caught on film – and that footage could end up in the movie. What was also interesting is that they absolved themselves of any liability through this notice. So, is anyone going to be a willing (or unwilling) punter in the background? Sounds like bragging rights to me, to say that you could be seen in the background of a Hollywood movie shot in Cowboy. And while Soi Cowboy could never be mistaken for Pattaya, it is good to see that a number of the bars are competing on price. Yep, not everyone in Bangkok is on a fat expat salary. Many bars have boards outside offering beer at affordable prices, especially before 9:00 PM when 40 baht beers can be easily found! In last week's column it was mentioned that girls at The Dollhouse in Soi Cowboy were dancing on stage in their jeans. This sight can only be seen on Thursday nights. I stuck my head in the Thermae last night for the first time in a long time, and I was glad I did. This legendary Bangkok night spot has turned itself around big time, and I was amazed at how much improved it was from my last visit, which was quite some time ago. The crowd the bar attracts appears to be quite different these days, if last night was anything to go by. For anyone who had given up on the Thermae a long time ago, you may well find it worth a look again. Morning Night in Sukhumvit Soi 4 has a banner advertising their 4th anniversary party this Thursday, 25th August, But no idea what they are offering – free drinks, food, who knows what?! In an unusual twist, Superstar in Patpong has hired a Vietnamese dancer who has really enhanced the line-up. At this point in time she is just dancing and doesn't leave with customers. She is a hit with lady customers with all the Thai women ogling her fair complexion and other assets, but her dancing colleagues do not seem to be welcoming the newcomer with open arms as they now have to try to keep up with her energetic dance moves. The bad news from Superstar is that the mamasan is throwing her weight around using a piercing police whistle to summon tardy dancers up on stage. There is nothing worse then sitting comfortably, enjoying the surroundings while sipping your favorite drink only to have your serenity blasted by this nutter sneaking up behind you and blasting your eardrums with her whistle. In a continuing trend, the music at many bars at the Pong has again been raised to jet plane taking off level again. Is there some private music volume contest that the DJs are all secretly competing against each other in? There is one DJ who rotates through several bars and is forever playing his tunes MUCH louder than even the most egregious violator of sane volume levels. Even after being told by the Thai owner of the bar several times turn down the music, the DJ merely waits a few minutes and it is right back up to ear splitting level again. A close friend of the owner asked why this guy is still working even after nightly warnings to turn down the music and the owner said \"cannot fire him\". Sounds like it could be another pissing contest, like we saw in a Pattaya bar recently. The big rumour of the week is that Club Eden, one Bangkok venue which has a very popular following – and a legion of satisfied customers, will be opening a new venue in Pattaya. Club Eden Pattaya *is* coming soon. In recent times a few readers have mentioned to me the lack of news from nightlife venues in Bangkok. There are two reasons for this, the first and foremost being that I do not go out in Bangkok as much as I did, and secondly, that things here have been a bit static. In terms of the nightlife, much more happens in Pattaya, hence I often have much more news from down there. And this week was no exception. I made the effort to get around all of the Bangkok nightlife areas, and most were quiet… Club Boesche in Pattaya seems to be in the news a lot recently, and it is not hard to see why. It is doing a brisk trade with many attractive ladies on the premises. Anyway, a friend was in there recently and barfined a young lady, early 20s, who he found to be extremely attractive. They went back to his hotel room and she went into the shower while he waited for the main event. Several minutes later she came out and he looked at her. Something was different. She then went and put something into a glass beside the bed. False teeth! To say the mood was killed would be a major understatement. Management of X Zone confirm that the bar is not for sale. X Zone A Gogo, at more than 250 square metres, is a big place and this means that the club can have an empty feeling at the beginning of the night. This is why they are going to make a major upgrade to the entrance and part of the club, providing a premier 'beach stage' which is due to open on October 1st. Another Bangkok bar can be added to the list of good spots to watch the Tri-Nations rugby this year. Remember, UBC no longer shows the rugby so you have to go somewhere which has either the Supersport feed from South Africa or the Australian Broadcasting feed. The Down Under Bar in Sukhumvit Soi 7/1 is attracting big crowds to watch the game with close to 100 rugby fans watching New Zealand put Australia to the sword yesterday (sorry, couldn't resist). The year-old Casino Club is staging a Coyote contest and Coyotee’s is staging a caboose contest. The Coyote Dance Contest at Casino gets underway at 10 PM tonight. Cash prizes are expected to lure an impressive line-up of dancers from near and far who, in turn, should lure a good number of oglers. Next week, the same Soi Diamond club will host a bash to celebrate its first anniversary. Competing for punters that night (Sunday, August 27), Coyotee’s will again give away money in what is shaping up as its monthly ass competition. In search of the best behind in Pattaya, the Soi Marina Plaza A Gogo is inviting ladies to shake and show their derrieres to a panel of judges and a club full of ass men. Last month’s contest was a huge success. This weekend, Fun Town nightspots were forced to tone down their antics due to an invasion of the men in brown. Nearly 100 Bangkok cops stormed into town on Thursday night reportedly to boost the moral standards of the city (and perhaps boost their incomes). Inspections began in North Pattaya and spread south to Walking Street. Not unlike most Pattaya punters, the police were in search of nudity and sex shows; their efforts were wasted. Tipped off in advance, most clubs arranged for dancers and showgirls to be fully clothed by the time police arrived; in better-connected clubs it was business as usual. Plods also checked IDs, to ensure no minors were working in or patronising nightspots, and that doors were shut before 2 AM. By Saturday, the boys in brown had returned to Bangkok and all was back to normal. The new Broadway seems to be the late Broadway. No official word, but the overpriced Soi BJ A Gogo has been dark lately and rumour has it that it is yet one more low-season fatality. But fear not, another gogo bar has been launched to fill the non-existent gap. The new Highway Star opened this week on the upper level of the Pier Entertainment center – just a few meters short of Walking Street. A large, brightly lit venue, the club has about two dozen dancers who do little to improve the appearance of the vast stage or the discomfort of the tiered bench-seating. There were even fewer punters Saturday night. Drink prices are more attractive than the dancers. A popular website, Pattaya Secrets, is about to launch a bar, nightclub and hotel. Secrets Bar plans a grand opening bash on September 1. Tucked away on Soi 14 off of Walking Street, the large hostess club will feature a broad variety of reasonably priced drinks and beers. Secrets Hotel, on that same site, is scheduled to open its 24 rooms on three floors at the end of next month. OK, so this is not exclusive to Bangkok, but I thought it was funny nonetheless. A certain bunch of people staying at a certain newly opened top-end hotel in Sukhumvit are causing the management all sorts of problems. They stay in the bigger rooms, usually the suites, and at some time during their stay they go out to the market and buy cheap sets of sheets and pillows. They take these back to the hotel and swap them with the good stuff the hotel uses. When they go to check out, all of the good stuff is packed away in their luggage. The management has become aware of the problem and when this lot check out the chambermaids have to verify that the bedding is the good stuff! Don't worry, if you're farang, you won't be suspected of this. It's another lot up to this trick. 45 teachers are needed for a special teaching project. This could be one way to find out if the teaching industry in Thailand is for you. You'll get paid $3,000, get a FREE TESOL certificate worth $1,590 & take a 5-month adventure holiday in Thailand. The scheduled program dates are 25 September 2006 through to 28 February 2007. Anyone interested should plan to arrive no later than 23 September. The benefits include free airport pick up from Bangkok and transfer to school, a TESOL certificate course from one of the world’s largest course providers, – TEFL International, beginning 25 September in Ban Phe. You get to work in a school in Thailand for 4 months earning 30,000 baht per month + housing. There are many locations to choose from all over Thailand. You can apply online here where you will have to pay $200 as a non-refundable deposit. This is open to native English speakers from the following countries only – USA, Canada, UK, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa. Ko Samui and particularly Ko Phangan are two islands very popular with young Israeli tourists – who have often just finished their military service. This year a lot of Lebanese from Sydney, Australia, decided against returning to their homeland for holidays and went to the south of Thailand instead. I just hope they didn't go to Samui or Phangan or there might have been some fireworks. A reader has a suggestion about the 90 day reporting or any other immigration problem that people might have. If you go to the one-stop office of the labor and immigration departments, located next to the labor department, you will find an empty room with some officials who seemingly have few customers during the day. No waiting. At least, said reader reports he has never had to wait and has never seen anyone else there. Depending on where you are, the location may be more convenient than the Suan Plu location. It's a short bus ride from (and a short walk from the bus stop) Victory Monument. I was at a flash hotel buffet recently and can you believe it, they charged for water? I will not shame the establishment in question, but thought this to be a bit questionable. What will be next – charging you to use their knives and forks?! And let’s clarify this, it was standard Thailand bottled water, the sort of water that goes for 5 baht a bottle, not the likes that is imported from the alps of France. Hmmm… It looks like the cost of petrol in Thailand is not just hitting the locals, but hitting farangs too. In the last week two guys I know have made the decision to get their vehicle converted so as to be able to run it on gas, and not just petrol. The conversion costs around 20,000 baht, and once converted, the vehicle can run on gas, which goes for less than 10 baht a litre, compared to petrol, which is currently around the 30 baht a litre mark. Quote of the week overheard in a bar. \"You farang have big money, why you have ugly girl?!\" In this week's news link, a suspected killer in the US flees to and hides out in Thailand. And another report with a hugely erroneous quote. \"The new visa allowed Mr. Karr to live and work in Bangkok, the capital of Asia's sex trade and a haven for thousands of Western pedophiles, without the need for three-monthly visa runs.\" More on all of his at the end of the column. Fox News' headline will not please anyone in Thailand with them titling a video news report on the whole incident, \"Pedophile Paradise\". Within seconds of the video clip beginning they talk about what they call Thailand's \"lucrative child sex industry\", calling it a billion dollar industry. With hugely erroneous information, they talked about 4 or 5 year olds being trafficked in and out of Bangkok. WTF?! They said these children get taken to the painter bars in Washington Square in downtown Bangkok. This was what they said. They obviously mean the bars of Sukhumvit Soi 33. Well, I have never seen, nor heard of any ladies under 18 there – in fact most are much older. And when they mention Washington Square, hell, in some bars the average age of the bargirls is older than me – and I'm no spring chicken! It is all a load of complete and utter BULLSHIT. They then go on to speculate that the only reason that people go to Thailand is for the sex industry. This is without a doubt the worst, most inaccurate report I have EVER heard about the subject of prostitution in Thailand. A disgrace from Fox News. Talk in the press is that there will be extra steps put in place to check the background of foreigners applying for teaching jobs in Thailand. The checks they refer to are checks with the local police here in Thailand, which would presumably only show up any offences committed here in Thailand, and it is therefore unlikely that anything would be revealed. I mean, if someone had committed a serious crime in Thailand then they almost certainly would have been deported from the country already and wouldn't be there in the first place. And contacting authorities in the West won't result in any info being divulged with most countries having fairly strong privacy laws in place. It all seems rather flawed to me. On top of this, what they do need to be careful of is that there is already so much paperwork and red tape already. Add to that the fact that salaries paid to foreigners teaching here really are on the low side. If they make it much more difficult for foreigners to teach in Thailand then it will just become too much of a chore and teachers will go elsewhere. Thailand needs foreign teachers. While every effort should be made to prevent people not suited to the industry from teaching, this has to be managed very carefully. Ask the Sticks Mrs. Stick is here to answer questions surrounding anything that confuses you in Thailand, particularly issues of the heart. Please note that for general bargirl related questions, Mr. Stick might answer them. Please do try and limit the length of questions to Mrs. Stick to about 100 words. We get many questions that are entire stories of several hundred words which I'm afraid are just too long to run here. Question 1: Over the last 6 months, my Isaan girlfriend of almost 2 years has been living with me in my homeland. During this time she became pregnant. When we returned to Thailand, she insisted that I return with her to her home village, to meet the parents, etc. During this visit, a ceremony was arranged that she could only describe as a 'good luck ceremony'. We sat by a thing that looked like a small Christmas tree, with hundreds of pieces of white string hung on it. A man arrived that I hadn't seen before and started speaking a lot and doing things that I can't really remember, but during this time, her father stuffed some money in his shirt pocket. After this, everyone in the room, probably three quarters of the village, came over and took the strands of string and tied one on my wrist and another on my girlfriend's wrist. At the end I had 50 – 60 pieces of string tied on me. Once the ceremony was over the food came out and we all sat and ate. The men then disappeared downstairs to open the truckload of Thai whiskey I had bought a few days before. My question is, what did it all mean? Are we married? I certainly didn't sign anything but I did kick in the seemingly statutory 100K ' sin sot' just to keep the peace. Mrs. Stick says: I cannot understand some guys who send questions to me. You go to a ceremony and pay what really is a lot of money, go through a major ceremony, and then later send me an email asking me what it was all about? Are you crazy? What you just went through was a spiritual exorcising ceremony, a ceremony where your girlfriend must have told someone in her family that you are the spawn of the devil and that these spirits need to be exorcised from you. Ok, I'll be serious now. What you went through is effectively an engagement ceremony. You are now engaged. Congratulations. Question 2: I have a great girlfriend. I trust her, and she has her own business, her own car, and her own money. She comes from a good family. If we get married, she told me that I would probably be expected to give a dowry of around one million baht. She said that unlike a middle-class or poor family that would keep the dowry to help the family, the dowry that I paid would be invested by her father for our future. He would give it back to us within a year. I do trust her, but in your opinion, is this a reasonable dowry, and do you think that if the family is already wealthy, her father would likely give it back to us? They already have a house and several cars worth at least a million baht anyway. I'm not rich, and a million baht is about all I have. Mrs. Stick says: From the way you describe the family, one million baht may be a fair amount for them to expect to be paid for the dowry for their daughter. If your girlfriend was to marry a Thai man I am guessing that this is the same amount they would ask for from him. However, you say that that is all the money you have. You should not be asked to give more than you can afford. I recommend that when you have the meeting to formally discuss this that you take along a senior Thai friend or colleague who knows your situation well and who can talk on your behalf. We are all feeling like a bunch of scum at the moment, with what is being said about us in some corners of the errant Western press. Bangkok is once again getting a really bad rap, and the generalisations are flowing fast. Sure, Bangkok is far from perfect and there are some mighty unusual, and even some downright questionable things that not just take place here, but are the norm, but for sure, when so-called respected Western newswires say that the city is home to thousands of Western pedophiles they really are speaking out of their backside. The line between the sex industry and child sex is being blurred and they are lumping it all together. It needs to be put on record that the vast majority of Westerners in Bangkok despise pedophiles as much as anyone, and what is being said in the press here about Bangkok being a pedophile paradise and the proliferation of Western pedophiles here is a complete and utter misrepresentation.

This story depicts the post-war horrors of Bangladesh, a war-struck nation in1971. The movie, directed by Chashi Nazrul Islam, is based on Rabeya Khatun's book of the same title, and serves as a symbolic sequel to the other Liberation War movies. It creates an essential portrait of one Great War and the men who made the decision to fight for a Bangladeshi dream, but whose victories were mutated into a nightmare with the razakars (enemies of the state) of this nation still at large.The title Megher Pore Megh, itself depicts the cloud of sadness remaining even after our Independence. The story begins with the tale of a young man, in modern times, desperately trying to find out the truth about his real father from his aged mother (Purnima). The father could have been anyone from a freedom fighter to a Pakistani captain or even a traitor. Against this background, the movie focuses primarily on the story of two freedom fighters (a double role by Riaz) Sezan Mahmood and Majid, and their love interest, Suraiya (Purnima). It shows the war stricken scenario of a Bangladeshi village, where the pak bahinis (Pakistani military) were welcomed by the razakars. The razakars would aid their Pakistani alliance to find the whereabouts of Bangladeshi villagers, burn their houses, kill the men, rape the women, thereby wreaking total havoc in the village.In one such harrowing sequence, Majid's house is under attack. His father is killed and although he could escape the ordeal with his wife Suraiya, the razakars found his younger sister and brutally raped and killed her.This sparked a revolutionary flame in the otherwise 'mild' man and provoked him to join the Mukti Bahini. However, unfortunately, he is taken captive by the Pakistan force during a battle and spills the plans on the Mukti Bahini's next few missions. After escaping from captivity, and while on the run, Majid admits his betrayal to Sezan, and eventually is killed for the act. During his last breath, he asks Sezan to look after his family. Sezan, similar in appearance to Majid, takes up the duty of looking after his family, with Majid's very identity. He also takes it upon himself to re-build the rural community. He faces obstacles set by the once-Pakistani alliance, pretending to be freedom fighters at every step. The movie clearly defines how the Bangladeshis are still suffering from the gluttony and viciousness of the sadistic razakars--who shamelessly term themselves as sons of this very soil. Chashi Nazrul has been brilliant at portraying the story of a battle, through Megher Pore Megh. The scope of the film is much broader and has a refreshing view towards religion. For instance, a moulvi wearing a white prayer cap is usually the villain in the movie, sketching a picture of a razakar. However, Megher Pore Megh has broken this conventional idea and has portrayed a positive image, where a God fearing man actually helps to build a better Bangladesh.The movie also contains the character, Nishat,(played by Mahfuz Ahmed),a young village moulvi and best friend of both Majid and later Sezan. The movie stands out from all the other generic Independence-based movies, in the sense that it gives a realistic interpretation of the war. The challenges faced by Nishat, during his attempt to pay a lump-sum amount toward the improvement of the village infrastructure, shows the nobility of a religious man, which are otherwise absent from most other liberation war based movies. The character remains beside Sezan, whom he refers to as 'a true warrior' in the movie, till the very end. The character of Suraiya (Purnima) portrays the sacrifice and struggle of women during the war. In the film, she is allegedly raped by Pakistani forces--a wrong accusation made by the village chieftain. But later, her life lights up with the entrance of Sezan (identifying himself as Majid). Her marriage to Sezan later, is a testimony to how men and women can complement each other, unafraid of incurring the wrath of society. The film opens the doors for introspection by all Bangladeshis. In particular it gives our people the opportunity to compare their values and ethics, with those left as a legacy by the Liberation War veterans. The movie is still running to packed houses.

The challenges faced by Nishat, during his attempt to pay a lump-sum amount toward the improvement of the village infrastructure, shows the nobility of a religious man, which are otherwise absent from most other liberation war based movies. The character remains beside Sezan, whom he refers to as 'a true warrior' in the movie, till the very end. The character of Suraiya (Purnima) portrays the sacrifice and struggle of women during the war. In the film, she is allegedly raped by Pakistani forces--a wrong accusation made by the village chieftain. But later, her life lights up with the entrance of Sezan (identifying himself as Majid). Her marriage to Sezan later, is a testimony to how men and women can complement each other, unafraid of incurring the wrath of society. The film opens the doors for introspection by all Bangladeshis. In particular it gives our people the opportunity to compare their values and ethics, with those left as a legacy by the Liberation War veterans. The movie is still running to packed houses.

ইসলাম আসাদ) এর সাথে থাকে। চাকরি সন্ধানে দীপা কলকাতায় যায়। সে তার বন্ধু অরুনার বাসায় উঠে। বেশ কয়েকটি সাক্ষাৎকারের পরেও দীপা কোন চাকরি পায় না, ফলে দীপা তারামতিতে ফিরে যাওয়ার সিদ্ধান্ত নেয়। ট্রেনে করে তারামতিতে ফিরতে যাওয়ার সময় তার ব্যাগ ছিনতাই হয়ে যায়। যেই ব্যাগে তার সকল সার্টিফিকেট, টাকা সহ অনেক মূল্যবান কাগজপত্র ছিলো। সহযাত্রীরা তার টিকিটের জন্য অর্থ প্রদান করে এবং দীপা বাড়ি পৌঁছাতে সক্ষম হয়। তার শ্যালক তাকে ফিরতে দেখে ব্যঙ্গাত্মক মন্তব্য করে।\n\nএদিকে অজিত চৌধুরী (ফেরদৌস) ট্রেনে রাজস্থানের এক মরু দেশ জয়সালমের যাচ্ছিলেন। যেখানে তার চাকরির পোস্টিং ছিলো। ঘটনাচক্রে পকেটমার দীপার ব্যাগ থেকে টাকা নিয়ে ব্যাগটি ট্রেনে ফেলে দিয়েছিল।  হঠাৎ ট্রেনের মধ্যে দীপা নন্দীর ব্যাগটি দেখতে পায় অজিত। এরপর সহযাত্রীর সাথে অজিতের আলোচনার সময় জানা যায় যে অজিত অনাথ। লোকের নাম এবং জন্মদিন সংগ্রহ করা এবং তাদেরকে জন্মদিনের কার্ড প্রেরণে তার শখ রয়েছে।  জয়সালমের পৌঁছে হারাধন কুন্ডু বা কুন্ডু সিং (মনোজ মিত্র) এর সাথে মিলিত হয়। কুন্ডু সিংহের দাদা ঢাকা থেকে এসে একটি হোটেল স্থাপন করেছিলেন। তবে ব্যবসায় মন্দা হয় এবং কুন্ডুর এখনকার কাজ হয় দর্শনার্থীদের হোটেল ইত্যাদি পেতে সহায়তা করা। কুন্ডু সিং অজিতের জন্য একটি কক্ষের ব্যবস্থা করেন। এখানে অজিত তার পাশের ঘরের বাসিন্দা রূপমতীর সাথে মিলিত হয়।\n\nঅজিত পরে টেনে খুঁজে পাওয়া ব্যাগটি দীপা নন্দীর ঠিকানায় ফেরত পাঠায়। দীপা নন্দী ব্যাগটি পেয়ে খুশি হয়। এবং অবাক হয়ে অচেনা মানুষটির কথা ভাবে। এবং তার পরবর্তীতে তিনি চিঠির উওর পাঠায় অজিতকে। এভাবে অনেক চিঠি আদান-প্রদান হয়। টেলিফোনেও একদিন কথা হয়। কিন্ত সংযোগে সমস্যা থাকায় উভয়ের মধ্যে তেমন কথা হয় নি। একসময় তারা একে অপরের প্রেমে পড়ে যায়। এদিকে রূপমতী (জুন মালিয়া) অজিতের প্রতি মোহিত হয়ে অজিতকে মুগ্ধ করার জন্য কুন্ডু সিংহের কাছ থেকে বাংলা শব্দ শেখার চেষ্টা করে। কিন্তু কুণ্ডু সিংহ যখন দীপার সাথে অজিতের চিঠির বিষয়ে রূপমতীকে জানায়, রূপমতী বিরক্ত হয়ে অজিতের মুখোমুখি হয়।\n\nঅজিত প্রতি রবিবার দীপাকে ফোন করে এবং দীপা অজিতকে একটি টি-শার্ট প্রেরণ করে যাতে সে অজিতকে চিনতে পারে। এদিকে দীপা চাকরির জন্য একটি সাক্ষাত্কারের ডাক পায়। তার শ্যালক প্রেমেন্দ্র দীপার কলকাতায় যাওয়ার ব্যবস্থা করে দেয়। অন্যদিকে জয়সলমেরে, কোম্পানির প্রধান অজিতকে ইউনিয়নের ঝামেলা পরিচালনা করার জন্য কারখানায় নতুন দায়িত্ব নেওয়ার জন্য বলে। ইউনিয়নের নেতারা অজিতকে হুমকি দেয়। অজিত চেষ্টা করে চাকরি ছেড়ে কলকাতায় ফিরে যাবার। তবে কোম্পানি অজিতকে কলকাতায়ই বদলি করে। কলকাতায় যাওয়ার আগে রূপমতী অজিতের কাছে ক্ষমা চায়।\n\nউভয়ই কলকাতায় যাওয়ার পর, অজিত ট্রেন স্টেশনে নেমে দীপার সাথে ধাক্কা খায় কিন্তু তারা একে অপরকে চিনতে পারে না। কলকাতায় গিয়ে তাদের চিঠি আদান-প্রদান বন্ধ হয়ে যায়৷ অজিত যে প্রতিষ্ঠানের কাজ পায় তার মালিকের মেয়ে ও অফিসের বস তার প্রেমে পড়ে। কিন্ত সে জানিয়ে দেয় যে সে অন্য একজনকে ভালোবাসে। কিন্ত বস তার উপর জোর করতে থাকে। এ থেকে বাঁচতে সে ঐ চাকরি ছেড়ে দেয়। পরবর্তীতে সিএনজি চালানো শুরু করে। অপরদিকে দীপা তারামাটিতে ফিরে যায়, অজিতের সাথে দীপার যোগাযোগ বন্ধ হয়ে যাওয়ায় দীপা খুব চিন্তায় পড়ে৷ একসময় তার বিয়েও ঠিক করে তার বোন ও দুলাভাই। এতে তিনি হতাশ হয়ে পড়ে। কিন্ত তবুও তিনি কলকাতা শহর আসেন। তিনি অজিতের অফিস এসে শুনতে পান যে অজিত চাকরি ছেড়ে দিয়েছেন। তবে বসের কাছে তার থাকার বাসার ঠিকানা নেন৷ উক্ত ঠিকানায় গিয়ে অজিতের অফিসের কর্মী যার সাথে তিনি থাকতেন, তার সাথে দেখা হয়। কিন্ত অজিত তখন আর তার সাথে থাকতেন না। সে তখন অন্য জায়গায় চলে গেছে। তবুও অফিসের কর্মী তাকে খুঁজিয়ে পাওয়ার আশ্বাস দেয়।\n\nদীপা আর তার বান্ধবী অনেক চেষ্টা করেন৷ তাকে খুঁজতে দিশেহারা হয়ে যায়। একসময় অজিতের সাথে ট্যাক্সিতে দেখা হয়, তবে এর আগে দেখা না হওয়ায় একে অপরকে চিন্তে পায়নি। রাত হয়েছিলো সেই সাথে তুমুল বৃষ্টি। রাস্তায় তেমন গাড়ি ছিলো না। তাই তার গাড়িতে চরে নানা জায়গায় গিয়ে অজিতের খোঁজ করতে লাগলো। দীপা বৃষ্টিতে ভিজে গিয়েছিলো তাই অজিত তাকে তার বন্ধুর বাড়িতে নেমে কাপড় পরিবর্তন করার অনুরোধ জানায়। দীপা তাতে রাজি হয়। তার বন্ধুর বাড়িতে সেও কাপড় পরিবর্তন করে। সে দীপার দেওয়া টি-শার্টটি পরে কিন্ত তার উপর চাদর জড়িয়ে দেয়। ফলে দীপা সেটি দেখতে পায় না।\n\nদীপা বাসা যাওয়ার জন্য স্টেশন ফেরার পথে তার বন্ধুর বাসায় যায় কিন্ত বাসা বন্ধ পায়। পাশের বাসার পরিচিত দিদির কাছে তাকে একটা চিঠি দিয়ে আসে৷ যে আমি এসেছিলাম, রাত ০৯:৩০ মিনিটের ট্রেনে বাসা ফিরবো।\n\nদীপা যখন অজিতের ট্যাক্সিতে স্টেশন যাচ্ছিলো, তখন অপরদিকে তার বান্ধুবী যখন ট্যাক্সিতে বাসা ফিরছিলো। এই ড্রাইভার এবং অজিত একসাথে থাকতো৷ তার বান্ধবী এবং ড্রাইভার মধ্যে এক কথপোকথনে  অজিত এবং দীপার মিল খুুুুঁজে পায়। দীপার বান্ধবী অবাক হয়ে তার নাম শুনতে চায়। শুনে সে চমকে উঠে বলে। এই সেই অজিত যাকে দীপা খুঁজছে। তার বান্ধবী যখন তার বাসায় চিঠি দেখতে পায় ও ততক্ষণাত সে ঐ ট্যাক্সিতে স্টেশন গিয়ে তাদেরকে খুঁজতে লাগে।\n\nট্রেন যখন ছেড়ে দেয়, দীপা তখন ট্রেনের  দরজায় দাঁড়িয়ে। ঠিক তখনি অজিত তার চাদর শরীর থেকে সরাতেই তার টি-শার্ট দীপার চোখে। ট্রেন থেকে নেমে এসে অজিতকে জড়িয়ে ধরে। ততক্ষণে তার বান্ধবী এবং ট্যাক্সি ড্রাইভারো এসে হাজির হয়।", "references": []}, {"title": "Introduction", "content": "হঠাৎ বৃষ্টি ১৯৯৮ সালে মুক্তিপ্রাপ্ত বাংলা ভাষার একটি প্রণয়ধর্মী চলচ্চিত্র। বাংলাদেশ-ভারতের যৌথ প্রযোজনার

There are a number of scenes of moderate violence. These generally occur in the context of set-piece action fights between the hero and villains. Although some heavy blows are landed, including kicks, punches and elbow blows to many parts of the body, little is shown in terms of blood or injury detail. One sequence shows a man pressing his thumb deep into his assailant's eye but this is a defensive move and lacks clear detail. Another scene shows a head-butt, resulting in a very brief spurt of blood from the nose. The single use of strong language ('f**k') is directed by a woman to her father but not in a particularly aggressive fashion. There are also uses of moderate language such as 'bitch', 'slut' and 'prick'. There are also some undetailed drug references, including a passing verbal reference to 'cooking crystal' and sight of a 'bong', which is not seen being used.

Almost 25 years ago, Lehrhaupt met a young man named Richard Linklater and spent a night with him that he never forgot. Their encounter inspired Linklater to conceive and direct Before Sunrise, the first film in the series. She never saw it, though; unbeknownst to Linklater, by the time that movie came out, Lehrhaupt was dead. Linklater never mentioned Lehrhaupt by name in the press before promoting Before Midnight—Ethan Hawke has said that the director was uncomfortable mentioning her until “extremely recently”—but he has long made brief references to their encounter. From a number of interviews he’s done over the years, we can now piece together the complete story of how Lehrhaupt helped inspire the series. Linklater met Lehrhaupt in fall 1989, when he was visiting his sister in Philadelphia. He was 29 and had just finished shooting Slacker, and was staying there for one night while passing through on the way home from New York. Lehrhaupt was several years younger, about 20. They met in a toy shop, and ended up spending the whole night together, “from midnight until six in the morning,” “walking around, flirting, doing things you would never do now.” As in Before Sunrise, most of what they did was talk, “about art, science, film, the gamut.” Did they kiss? Yes. Did they have sex? The Times went so far as to ask Linklater in a recent interview, but he said he wants to “leave a little mystery.” Even in the midst of that romantic night, the filmmaker in Linklater couldn’t help but consider its cinematic possibilities. In a 2004 interview with the New York Times, he remembered “walking around [thinking], ‘If I could just capture this feeling I’m having right now,’ instead of actually having that feeling.” On a recent episode of the podcast The Q&A with Jeff Goldsmith, he recalled mentioning the movie idea to Lehrhaupt that night: Even as that experience was going on … I was like, “I’m gonna make a film about this.” And she was like, “What ‘this’? What’re you talking about?” And I was like, “Just this. This feeling. This thing that’s going on between us.” But as the night came to an end, the paths of Linklater and Lehrhaupt began to diverge from the fictional storyline of Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Céline (Julie Delpy). In fact, on The Q&A, Linklater revealed that the ending of Before Sunrise was in part a response to what happened with him and Lehrhaupt. Unlike Jesse and Céline, who agree to reconvene in six months, the real-life young lovers exchanged numbers and tried to keep in touch while they were away. They called each other a few times, but it was “that long distance thing” that did them in. “It sort of did the fizzle,” he says, “So in the first movie that was a thing, the idea that they would intellectually kind of get beyond that and say ‘Well, we’re on different continents. What are the odds that it’s gonna work. Let’s just commit to this night.’ ” Linklater soon became involved with another woman, who “swept into [his] life … and took over for about a year or so,” and he and Lehrhaupt never talked again. He did think that maybe “she would show up at a Before Sunrise screening or something.” In Before Sunset, Céline shows up at a reading of Jesse’s book This Time, which is based on their night together. “It would be so weird,” he said, in 2004. But she never did. Linklater didn’t know then that Lehrhaupt had died in a motorcycle accident on May 9, 1994, before she reached her 25th birthday. Before Sunrise started filming a few weeks later. Linklater only learned of her death three years ago, when a friend of Lehrhaupt’s, who knew about the encounter, put it together and sent him a letter. “It was very sad,” Linklater told the Times. Ethan Hawke was similarly devastated when he heard it, though he reminded Linklater that if he hadn’t met her, then he never would have made these movies or met some of the people who worked on them with him. “Who knows how we reverberate through each other’s lives,” Linklater reflected in another interview, “But she’s an inspiration on this.” In this way, Linklater did find another way to make that feeling, that “thing in the air” they once had between them, last: He turned it into cinema.

The 14-hour relationship that followed, as the pair explored the spontaneous and unexpected in Vienna, ended on a train platform where they swore they'd meet again six months later. Nine years have passed since that morning. On the last stop of his book tour, at the tail end of a reading in a Paris book shop, Jesse finds Celine watching from the back of the room. She lives in Paris now, he in New York. He's flying out that evening and they utilize every moment, finding their human connection no less vital, inspiring or real than it was in nine years ago in Vienna. In a stimulating and revealing journey through Paris, in real time, these two individuals explore the inner workings of their hearts and minds and rediscover their rare yet powerful love for the unexpected, the unrehearsed, and each other.

Are you into ghost stories? Well, I have been thinking of making a bhooter film for a long time. In fact, when Shree Venkatesh Films approached me for two films (last year), I asked if we could do the ghost film first but they wanted me to start with Feluda and I did Royal Bengal Rahasya, which was a good decision because Bibhuda (Bhattacharya, who played Jatayu in the previous Feluda films) passed away all of a sudden. Bhoot (ghosts) is a favourite subject of mine and nowadays bhoots are doing very well in the market (referring to Anik Datta’s Bhooter Bhobishyot)! Besides, our family has had a fascination for bhoots since the time of Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne (laughs)! So I started reading a lot of ghost stories, not the run-of-the-mill stuff but the slightly unusual ones. Unfortunately, I did not come across a novel or a novelette on the subject. I watched a lot of old ghost films like The Uninvited (1944), The Haunting (1963) but I didn’t get a springboard. Then I decided to re-read some of the Bengali short stories, which also includes some of Baba’s (Satyajit Ray) works. I had done a series on ghost stories (Satyajiter Goppo for Doordarshan and ETV Bangla), which did very well. So I kind of revisited those stories and then I read up Sharadindu Bandopadhyay and Bibhutibhushan Bandopadhyay... anek kichhu porlum (I read up a lot). I chose four stories, of which three are Baba’s and one Sharadindu’s. These four stories will be merged to form one film. There’s a light-hearted ghost story, there’s one with an eerie atmosphere. Basically, there will be four categories of bhoot in the film! We start shooting from August 5. I haven’t decided on a title for the film, but we plan to release it in December. Tell us about the stories you have selected... The three stories by Baba are Anathbabur Bhoy, Brown Shaheber Bari and Lucknower Duel. Bhoot Bhobishyot is by Sharadindubabu. I don’t want to reveal much about the stories. As it is, most people have read them. Apu (Saswata Chatterjee) stars in Bhoot Bhobishyot. He plays a writer. We will start with Anathbabur Bhoy and Bhoot Bhobishyot; we will shoot in Bolpur in August. Brown Shaheber Bari will be shot in Kalimpong and Lucknower Duel in Lucknow. I had shot a few episodes of Anathbabur Bhoy for television long ago. Unfortunately, that series was never televised.... Bhoot Bhobishyot is a very funny story and very filmable. I have kept the stories as they are with slight fine-tuning and embellishments. The interesting thing about a short story is that you can’t expand it. Especially Baba’s and Sharadindubabu’s short stories are so crisp and tight that if I expand even a wee bit, the suspense won’t hold up. The average length of each story would be about 20-25 minutes. How will the four stories be connected? I wanted a thread that would connect the stories and I thought the best way to do that would be to bring in the character of Tarini Khuro from Baba’s stories. We did introduce him on television and he became very popular (played by Saswata Chatterjee and his late father Subhendu Chatterjee). Tarini Khuro will be telling these stories to children and as one story ends, we will see him starting another and that’s how we will connect the four stories. There will be a smooth flow from one story to the other. I hope this format works. Saswata apart, who plays what in the film? Paran Bandopadhyay will play Tarini Khuro. Paranda has done a wide range of work, especially Royal Bengal Rahasya where he played a totally different kind of character. I like working with people I have worked with before, like I have worked with Saswata before on television and also in Hitlist. Now I see that all my Topshes (Saswata, Parambrata Chattopadhyay and Shaheb Bhattacherjee) are doing very well! Topshe-der bajaar gorom (laughs). Saswata is a fine artiste, absolutely brilliant. Abir (Chatterjee) is there in Brown Shaheber Bari; there’s Dwijen Bandopadhyay and Biswajit Chakraborty too. The rest of the cast I’m yet to finalise. What’s the period you’ll cover? The period of Sharadindubabu’s story is the ’50s. The film will be set between the ’50s and ’80s. Tarini Khuro has a fan club, like Galpo Dadur Aashor, and I can’t make him a contemporary character. He is someone who tell stories to kids. Today’s kids don’t listen to stories. They are hooked to their computers. My film will be set in the pre-computer and pre-mobile phone era. Who’s the target audience of the film? The Feluda audience. It’s not for kids. This film is for young adults. You had also planned to do Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne... No, not immediately because Rangan Chakravarty is doing Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne in a different way.... For me, Goopy Gyne is there in the pipeline. The main problem is the budget, the budget will naturally shoot up because you have to create a whole lot of things, plus a lot of special effects. If we are doing it in Bengali, we will have to be very careful because our market is very limited... let’s see. Next, I am planning something on Professor Shonku. But Shonku has to be done in a very big way. Let’s see.... When can we expect the next Feluda film? Feluda, not now. I am keeping my eyes and ears open for a new Feluda. Benu (Sabyasachi Chakrabarty) is ageing and I will not make the next Feluda before two other films. So I am looking at a fresh team. Shaheb (Bhattacherjee, who plays Topshe) is good enough to play Topshe... two-three years won’t be a problem for him. I have to have a new Jatayu too. And if I cast a new Feluda, then I have to go further back in terms of stories. If I get someone interesting, I will start with Badshahi Angti. I also want to do a Bomkesh (Bakshi) someday. I have a weakness for Sharadindubabu. Monday , July 30 , 2012", ""]}]}

What a story, indeed. And full marks to writer Althea Delmas Kaushal for crafting a jigsaw that would have made Agatha Christie smile. It wouldnâ€™t be incorrect to say, they don't make movies like this anymore. Stylishly crafted, cunning in plot and nubile in its narrative thrust, Game is one of the most aesthetically-mounted Hindi films in recent times. Huge efforts and resources have gone into shooting the murder mystery in places where intrigue seems infinite, escape seems undesirable and redemption appears as distant as the sound of the waves splashing against rocks that have centuries of stories to tell. Welcome to the Greek island of Samos. Anupam Kher, looking pricey in his tycoonâ€™s avatar invites four of the most distinguished elitist-outlaws on this side of Charles Sobhraj. Each has a past tense and a future imperfect. Everyone has a history and a back-projection. This is a world defined by a wealth of unexpressed resentment and smothered anger waiting to erupt. Debutant director Abhinay Deo displays a remarkable grip over the proceedings. Though the narrative moves through a number of continents and exotic cities (Istanbul jumps out at us from the James Bond movies) propelling his tortured characters forward into motions of restless salvation, there is a quietude and grace at the heart of the narration that weâ€™ve scarcely ever seen in desi whodunits. The crime and its denouement are worked in graphic details. But the narrative is never bogged down by over-punctuation. For a crime thriller that pays homage to the best traditions of the genre represented by Sherlock Holmes, Agatha Christie and James Hadley Chase, there is a tightly-wound feel to the storytelling, as though the director were moving contrary to the dictates of the genre, without slipping up with the details. If God lies in the details then why does the devil seem to have taken over Game? At heart Game is a love story about a high-profile gambler and his doomed lady-love...a kind of Bonnie and Clyde with the inherent desperation of the duo's togetherness reined-in and qualified by ripples of elegant punctuation. No hiccups, then, in Abhinay Deo's directorial debut. Like all cinema by filmmakers who come from the ad-world Game is a visual feast. Contrary to films by other ad-turned-feature director Deo doesn't unnecessarily abbreviate the shots in the fear of losing audiencesâ€™ attention. The characters, especially Abhishek Bachchan's, get sufficient breathing space in a script that favours flirting with fate rather than fornicating with flamboyance. There is a delicacy in the textures and colours used to bring forward the tensions in the plot. Shashank Tere's art direction and Kartik Vijay's cinematography imbue a gritty cold edge to the spill of blood and the smell of greed. The portions shot on the Greek island are particularly hypnotic, the splashing waves creating a ripple of anxieties in the turbulence of the characters' lives without toppling the storytelling boat over into the sphere of the stormy. Whether it is Anupam Kher as tycoon-host on the mesmeric island or Gauhar Khan as his seductive secretary, the characters never cease to appear glamorous on screen. The performers are eminently watchable. Anupam Kher, Kangna Ranaut, Boman Irani, Shahana Goswami and the underrated Jimmy Sheirgil get the tenor of tantalizing terror right. Sarah Jane Dias is quite a find, though she needs to work on her dancing skills. Her fabulously choreographed dance number suffers from the Two Left Feet Syndrome (hint hint!). Abhishek Bachchan proves once again a master of silences, his eyes conveying the pain of lost love , his lips curling up to convey the cynicism of a man who has seen it all and couldnâ€™t care anymore. His two action key sequences are heart-stopping in their credibility.

Jha - April 2, 2011 - 9:53 AM IST \"What a story!\" Abhishek Bachchan, playing a cross between a fugitive and a guardian-angel, says wryly at this elegantly crafted whodunit.What a story, indeed. And full marks to writer Althea Delmas Kaushal for crafting a jigsaw that would have made Agatha Christie smile. It wouldnâ€™t be incorrect to say, they don't make movies like this anymore. Stylishly crafted, cunning in plot and nubile in its narrative thrust, Game is one of the most aesthetically-mounted Hindi films in recent times. Huge efforts and resources have gone into shooting the murder mystery in places where intrigue seems infinite, escape seems undesirable and redemption appears as distant as the sound of the waves splashing against rocks that have centuries of stories to tell.Subhash K. Jha speaks about GameWelcome to the Greek island of Samos. Anupam Kher, looking pricey in his tycoonâ€™s avatar invites four of the most distinguished elitist-outlaws on this side of Charles Sobhraj. Each has a past tense and a future imperfect. Everyone has a history and a back-projection. This is a world defined by a wealth of unexpressed resentment and smothered anger waiting to erupt.Debutant director Abhinay Deo displays a remarkable grip over the proceedings. Though the narrative moves through a number of continents and exotic cities (Istanbul jumps out at us from the James Bond movies) propelling his tortured characters forward into motions of restless salvation, there is a quietude and grace at the heart of the narration that weâ€™ve scarcely ever seen in desi whodunits.The crime and its denouement are worked in graphic details. But the narrative is never bogged down by over-punctuation. For a crime thriller that pays homage to the best traditions of the genre represented by Sherlock Holmes, Agatha Christie and James Hadley Chase, there is a tightly-wound feel to the storytelling, as though the director were moving contrary to the dictates of the genre, without slipping up with the details. If God lies in the details then why does the devil seem to have taken over Game?At heart Game is a love story about a high-profile gambler and his doomed lady-love...a kind of Bonnie and Clyde with the inherent desperation of the duo's togetherness reined-in and qualified by ripples of elegant punctuation.No hiccups, then, in Abhinay Deo's directorial debut. Like all cinema by filmmakers who come from the ad-world Game is a visual feast. Contrary to films by other ad-turned-feature director Deo doesn't unnecessarily abbreviate the shots in the fear of losing audiencesâ€™ attention. The characters, especially Abhishek Bachchan's, get sufficient breathing space in a script that favours flirting with fate rather than fornicating with flamboyance. There is a delicacy in the textures and colours used to bring forward the tensions in the plot. Shashank Tere's art direction and Kartik Vijay's cinematography imbue a gritty cold edge to the spill of blood and the smell of greed. The portions shot on the Greek island are particularly hypnotic, the splashing waves creating a ripple of anxieties in the turbulence of the characters' lives without toppling the storytelling boat over into the sphere of the stormy.Whether it is Anupam Kher as tycoon-host on the mesmeric island or Gauhar Khan as his seductive secretary, the characters never cease to appear glamorous on screen. The performers are eminently watchable. Anupam Kher, Kangna Ranaut, Boman Irani, Shahana Goswami and the underrated Jimmy Sheirgil get the tenor of tantalizing terror right. Sarah Jane Dias is quite a find, though she needs to work on her dancing skills. Her fabulously choreographed dance number suffers from the Two Left Feet Syndrome (hint hint!).Abhishek Bachchan proves once again a master of silences, his eyes conveying the pain of lost love , his lips curling up to convey the cynicism of a man who has seen it all and couldnâ€™t care anymore. His two action key sequences are heart-stopping in theircredibility. Waltzing wickedly between the incredible and the inevitable Game succeeds in sustaining our interest right till the devilish denouement at the end.Game is a film that never lets us forget that the whodunit attains an enticing aura only when the characters assume framed postures. Abhinay Deo's narrative walks a fine thin bloodied balance between dread and delight. Game is one helluva stylish knick-knack.

Jha speaks about Game The Boys Season 3 Finale: Jensen Ackles, Karl Urban, Erin Moriarty,… Malaika Arora returns from Paris, meets newlyweds Nayanthara and… ENHYPEN refuse to conform and take charge of their new future in…", "Is the Bengali cinema world about to go commercial? An earlier generation of 'art' filmmakers would have shuddered at the very thought. But today's thoroughly modern moviemakers have bowed to the fact that lucre isn't always filthy -- and that a movie can be a commercial and aesthetic hit at the same time. Leading the way is Rituparno Ghosh, the new star of Kolkata's cash-starved but influential film world. Ghosh is raking in the cash for his Chokher Bali made with national level stars like Aishwariya Rai. Chokher Bali cost Rs 1.8 crore (Rs 18 million) which is a king's ransom by the standards of Bengali cinema. But Ghosh is getting almost instant returns. The Bengal film industry is buzzing with the news that the movie has made Rs 1.25 crore (Rs 12.5 million) within the boundaries of the state. In addition it quickly made Rs 20 lakh (Rs 2 million) only in Pune and Mumbai. The movie is still showing in north India and returns from the region haven't been accurately calculated yet. On top of this the movie still has the global market to conquer. Ghosh isn't the only Bengali filmmaker who has discovered that the dynamics of moviemaking have altered in the last few years. The first print of Buddhadeb Dasgupta's Mondo Meyer Upakhyan cost around Rs 65 lakh (Rs 6.5 million). But it has been sold for $1.5 million to Cinemavault a distributor, which plans to release it in the international markets. Similarly, Bombaiyer Bombete, directed by Sandip Ray (the son of Satyajit Ray), has been a runaway hit at home and is preparing to hit the national and international markets. In the movie Sandip has resurrected Feluda, the legendary fictional detective conceived by his father. Bombaiyer Bombete cost around Rs 65 lakh to produce and it recovered the money in the first two weeks. It is currently in its fourth week in Kolkata. Most interestingly, Bombaiyer Bombete was produced by Ramoji Films, which runs a Bengali entertainment channel ETV. And the film will be released nationally and in the international markets by Mayuri Films, a marketing wing of Ramoji Films. The company says it will show the film in any place, which has a sizeable Bengali community. The Ramoji Group isn't the only corporate entity that is turning the camera on the Bengal film industry. The A V Birla has been watching carefully from the sidelines. Applause Entertainment, the entertainment arm of the Aditya Birla Group, is about to release a Telugu film at the end of January. Its next focus area is Bengal and it is already talking to two major directors in Kolkata. Anshuman Swamy, CEO, Applause Entertainment reckons it would like to back a film that's somewhere between parallel and commercial cinema like Chokher Bali. Says Swamy: \"West Bengal is a potent market for expressing creativity.\" Why are quality Bengali films suddenly prospering and even making money? For a start, they are made with the box-office in mind and they have been loved by the audiences. Over and above that, however, is the fact that audiences are changing and that there are new ways of reaching them. Take Ghosh's Shubho Mahurat, which is said to have made a princely Ł12,000 after two shows in the UK. It was also showed a few times in the United States and made $2,000 per show. On top of that the film has been sold to Britain's Channel Four for a substantial amount. Now comes the even bigger news that Ghosh is negotiating with Miramax, the Hollywood powerhouse, for the international distribution rights to Chokher Bali. Ghosh admits cheerfully that he is willing to tailor his movies slightly to fit the new needs of the marketplace. He says that Rai's presence in Chokher Bali helped hugely during negotiations for overseas distribution. Rai has high-profile visibility and everyone who is anyone in the global film world knows who she is. After all, she is a former Miss World, a jury member at Cannes and a brand ambassador for several multi-national companies. Also, she is playing the lead in Gurinder Chaddha's film Bride and Prejudice. Ghosh is convinced that national icons like Aishwarya Rai, Sharmila Tagore and Rakhi helped enormously to make his films, Chokher Bali and Shubho Mahurat, more appealing to audiences across India and abroad. Unlike many other Bengali filmmakers, Ghosh is willing to be flexible in order to sell his films. He will send a shortened version of Chokher Bali for international release. That's because foreign movies are, by and large, shorter than Indian movies and should ideally last around 90 minutes and not more than that. He also criticises the industry for its old-fashioned way of looking at things. Says Ghosh: \"Why do we look at the global market by default, why can't we look global by design and approach it in a strategic way?\" Other industry experts point out that going global isn't always an easy proposition. The film must do the rounds in the right film festivals -- like Berlin, Venice, Cannes -- and catch the attention of the right buyers. Arindam Mukherjee, managing director, Arjoe Entertainment (which distributed Mondo Meyer Upakhyan) insists that it has been a tough task. \"Film festivals are the entry market for films,\" says Mukherjee. Once you are there, however, a combination of exchange rates and international pricing ensure that the money comes back quickly. \"That is where the money is and it has to be tapped,\" says Arijit Datta, president, Eastern India Motion Pictures Association. Dutta, who owns a distribution company and a leading cinema hall in Kolkata says that Bengali films must keep foreign audiences in mind if they want to recover their costs. The problem, he points out, is that Kolkata has only three movie theatres that show quality Bengali films. Also, the prices of tickets for Bengali films are lower than for English and Hindi movies. Says Datta: \"With movie-making budgets shooting up, one has to look at the foreign market to recover costs.\" The advent of the multiplex era may make things better for the quality Bengali film industry. Four multiplexes are scheduled to be ready by the middle of 2004. These could improve the commercial viability of quality Bengali films to some extent. Besides that, Ghosh believes that filmmakers haven't yet been making full use of satellite television. \"We must look at selling the films to national television channels at a premium,\" says Ghosh.

He ventured to make the first Assamese film Joymoti when there were no basic amenities to produce a film in the state. He shouldered all risks and gave the Assamese people the taste of cinema in the early part of the last century. He was the producer, director, script writer, lyricist, music director, art director, choreographer, costume designer and editor of the film. With his individual effort, the making of Joymoti itself is an adventurous story. For indoor shooting of the film, Jyotiprasad set up a studio at Bholaguri Tea Estate, near Gohpur which was owned by the Agarwalla family. Named as ‘Chitraban’, the studio was built using indigenous materials like bamboo,wood and banana stumps. The set was artistically designed by Jyotiprasad himself using bamboo mats, japis of different sizes, deer horns, buffallo horns, Naga spears etc. To decorate the Ahom court, he used various royal utensils such as maihang, hengdang, bhogjara, sarai, bata, sariya, banbata, lota etc. appropriately. He imported a Faizi sound recording system from Lahore and a camera from one Mehta of Kolkata. The film unit arrived at Bholaguri Tea Estate in the month of December, 1933 and camped in front of the garden factory. Jyotiprasad made all arrangements for fooding and lodging for every member of the unit at a temporary shed. He, alongwith the female members of the unit stayed at the garden bungalow during the shooting period. He also set up a laboratory for developing film by the side of his ‘Chitraban’ studio. As described by Natasurya Phani Sarma, who enacted an important role in the film, Chitraban was not only a film studio, but it was more a film training institute. Apart from acting, Jyotiprasad taught the actors the different techniques of filmmaking such as film developing, processing and printing, editing etc. He also gave them lessons of different film shots like mixed shot, fade out, fade in, dissolve, back projection, model shot, trick shot etc. The constumes were designed by Jyotiprasad and the make-up was done by the actors themselves, assisted by Sonitkowar Gajen Borua. The shooting at the Chitraban studio started in April, 1934 after Bohag Bihu. It was delayed because Jyotiprasad could not at first find a suitable girl to play the role of the heroine of the film. After a relentless effort and search, he discovered Aideu Handique to play the role of Joymoti in a remote village near Golaghat. He brought her to Bholaguri to act in front of the camera with the promise of showing her the steamer on the Brahmaputra. But now, the weather stood as an obstacle in the shooting of the film. As the rainy season had already started, he had to suspend shooting for a number of days due to insufficient light. It is worth mentioning here that there was no provision of electricity in the temporary studio. Shooting was done under sunlight by using reflectors. Sometimes a shot was left half-done due to the pouring rain. When the rain stopped, the banana stumps used to build the Ahom court were dried in the sun. But Jyotiprasad went on shooting the film by fastening japis in those places. Overcoming all obstacles, Jyotiprasad completed the shooting of his maiden film on the auspicious day of Janmastami in the month of August. Situated about 10 km west of Gohpur, Bholaguri today looks deserted, bearing the nostalgia of its glorious past. Once owned by Jyotiprasad, the ownership of the garden passed on to the Assam Tea Corporation in 1978. The garden, where Jyotiprasad laid the foundation stone of Assamese cinema some 70 years ago, today lies abandoned. The bungalow, where Jyotiprasad composed the music of the first Assamese film on his organ, still stands in the same place, but in a dilapidated condition. While the entire state is celebrating the birth centenary of this illustrious son of Assam, not a single function has been held at Bholaguri where he translated the immortal story of Joymoti into celluloid. Under the aegis of a number of organisations, the celebrations got underway in a befitting way in every nook and corner of the state, but not even a simple function has been held at Bholaguri.

Under the aegis of a number of organisations, the celebrations got underway in a befitting way in every nook and corner of the state, but not even a simple function has been held at Bholaguri. No individual or organisation has time to remember Bholaguri Tea Estate where Jyotiprasad translated his long cherished dream into reality.

Playwright-turned-director Balachander has had an eventful career of over four-and-a-half decades in cinema and has directed over a hundred films in Tamil, Telugu and Hindi. Most of his early films were remakes of his successful plays on stage like Neerkumizhi, Edhir Neechal, Server Sundaram, Bhama Vijayam, Major Chandrakant, and Naanal, among others. Those were days when cinema was made only in black and white and emotional and melodramatic family dramas ruled the roost. Balachander was a past master in the art of making films which struck a chord in the hearts of the audiences and almost all his black and white films were successful. He was one of the first filmmakers to win over audiences with fiery dialogues and attractive story lines and he could make the transition from stage to screen with ease. A turning point in the then young director’s career was the films in which he projected female protagonists in a series of avant garde films like Aval Oru Thodarkathai and Avargal (Sujatha), Thappu Thalangal, Agni Sakshi and Achamillai Achamillai (Saritha), Kalki (Shruti) and Sindhu Bhairavi (Suhasini). Balachander’s heroines were those who rebelled against a male chauvinistic society and were tough as nails as they fought a system that forced them to buckle under. All these films proved to be huge hits and the Balachander fan club began to swell. Apart from his numerous films, seven of which won National Awards, Balachander has secured his place among the pantheon of greats in Indian cinema for the number of stars that he introduced to the silver screen. Nagesh, Rajnikant, Kamal Haasan, Chiranjeevi, Prakash Raj, Vivek, Sujatha, Jayanthi, Jayaprada were all virtual nonentities till Balachander took them under his wing. The hard taskmaster put them all through a tough grind and such was his keenness for perfection that none of his artistes could get away with a half-baked performance. Kamal Haasan, who started out as a child artiste, was reintroduced to the Tamil industry in Arangetram and has since done several films with his guru. Significant among these films are mega hits like Apoorva Ragangal, Ninaithaale Inikkum, Varumaiyin Niram Sivappu and Unnal Mudiyum Thambi. Rajnikant caught his eye when the director visited a film institute in Chennai where the latter was a student and soon, Rajnikant made his debut in a small but vital role in Apoorva Ragangal. Avargal, Thappu Thalangal, Thillu Mullu and Netrikan soon followed. When both his protégés reached the pinnacle of their careers, Balachander once commented that he could no longer afford to cast them in his films that were often made on shoestring budgets. One of his late introductions to the Tamil industry, Prakash Raj, has been going places and already has a couple of National Awards in his kitty. Balachander, often, boldly ventured into areas which were taboo for the rest of his tribe — the travails of a prostitute (Arangetram and Thappu Thalangal), a whole village fighting an official’s apathy in their quest for water (Thanneer Thaneeer), the transformation of an honest man into a scheming politician (Achamillai Achamillai) and the infatuation of a famous classical singer for his ardent fan (Sindhu Bhairavi) who bears his child out of wedlock, were all themes that clicked and classified him as a filmmaker who could tackle various subjects with aplomb; a proof of his versatility. A number of his assistants like Vasant and Charan have since branched out into their own and have carved respectable niches as filmmakers. Apart from Telugu films like Maro Charithra and Rudra Veena, Balchander also made a foray into Bollywood with the blockbuster, Ek Duje Ke Liye, a remake of his Telugu hit, Maro Charithra. The film had Kamal Haasan and Rati Agnihotri in the lead. Lamikant-Pyarelal scored the music while Lata Mangeshkar and S P Balasubramanian rendered the lyrics and were chart-toppers. His later films like Ek Nai Paheli, however, received only a lukewarm response and the director never ventured into Hindi cinema again. Simultaneously, he also turned producer and his banner has made several hit films ever since. A lesser known fact is that it was Balachander who introduced A R Rahman in Roja, which was produced by him and directed by Mani Ratnam.The octogenarian now devotes his time to the small screen and has all but thrown in the towel where feature films are concerned. There are no takers for his brand of cinema anymore as technical wizardry has taken over and storyline or the theme are no longer relevant. Yet, looking back at his eventful career, this Dadasaheb Phalke award winner can be content for he has stood his ground for so long, withstanding competition from some of his outstanding contemporaries like Sridhar, K S Gopalakrishnan, Bharathiraaja, Mahendran and Balu Mahendra. And that, by any yardstick, is no mean feat.

It was another K Balachander movie with Rajnikanth playing an abusive and sadistic husband. Avargal tells the story of a hapless woman walking out of an oppressive marriage to seek employment in the city and start life afresh. When she is about to be united with the man she loves the sadistic husband once again enters her life. With studied guile he worms his way into her life as a supposedly reformed and repentant man. When the vulnerable woman is all ready to give him a second chance he shows his true colours, leaves her and goes back to his already existing second wife and child. Balachander ends the film on a note of poetic justice. The man gloating over his own treachery turns away only to be hit in the eye by a flying stick accidentally aimed by the urchins playing nearby. In Avargal, Rajnikanth gave a classic performance projecting a combination of two contrasting facets of villainy -- both openly sadistic and wily. He actually outdid himself as the wily scheming man. Like all the other films, here too, Kamal stars in this film as the heroine's widower colleague.

What happens to him makes up Hansal Mehta’s ‘Aligarh’. It is a film both timely and telling, because of what it is about, and how it is told. Queer characters are not characters who just happen to be queer in most Bollywood movies. They are stereotypes sent up for sniggers (with the notable exception of a few of Onir’s films, ‘My Brother Nikhil’, and ‘I Am’ ; Karan Johar’s segment in ‘Bombay Talkies’). They mince rather than walk. They dangle their wrists. They are there to be mocked at. Shrinivas Ramchandra Siras (Manoj Bajpayee) is getting on in years. As befits a teacher and author, he is a man of letters. He likes poetry. He likes a glass or two of the good stuff when the day is ending. Above all he is alone, sharing his loneliness with Lata Mangeshkar’s soulful songs, and occasionally, a tryst with another human who just happens to be of the same sex. Also read: ‘Aligarh’ is a portrait of loneliness: Hansal Mehta Deepu (Rajkummar Rao) is the Delhi-based reporter of a national daily who stumbles upon the Siras ‘story’ in a local Aligarh paper, and pursues it with his photographer colleague Tashi (Gulati). (Full disclosure: Deepu Sebastian Edmond, on whom Rao’s reporter is based, was with the Indian Express when the story broke; photojournalist Tashi Tobgyal works with the paper). Siras’ ‘case’ segues into the historic 2009 Delhi High Court judgement which decriminalized homosexuality, and is fought by a legal eagle (Ashish Vidyarthi) who places privacy in a bedroom beyond the ‘moral’ pale, and sneering guardians of ‘morality’. The hectoring tone of the public prosecutor in Allahabad is of a piece with the general castigation brought to bear upon the LGBT community, and Siras’s exoneration feels like a victory, even if short-lived. What is really interesting about Siras is his visible discomfort at being labelled ‘gay’; he’d rather not be labelled anything at all. That discomfiture tells us much more about him than anything else: he is of a generation which doesn’t go around sticking convenient bumper-stickers on people; for him they are just people, whether they dance, giving vent to their longing, in all-stag parties (one of the film’s most astonishingly poignant sequences), or whether they barge into his bedroom, video camera at the ready. Manoj Bajpayee makes of Siras a man whose bewildered fragility is up for examination, and whose gentleness demands understanding and compassion. There are initial moments where you can see Bajpayee trying. And then he becomes Siras, greying hair curling at the temples, a worn suit to be donned when out of the house, an old blanket draped around the shoulders when home, fingers carving notes in the air as Lata’s voice fills his shabby living room. It is a fine performance, quiet and affecting. Watch: Audience Reactions To Aligarh & Tere Bin Laden Dead Or Alive And it carries ‘Aligarh’, especially when Manoj Bajpayee transcends himself, and gives us a man trying to deal with pain and humiliation with dignity. Rao’s youthful ebullience is an effective counter, his Malayalam- inflected Hindi just right. It is a pleasure to see these actors interact. The newsroom doesn’t feel as real as it should, though (for that, please watch ‘Spotlight’, which gets it spot-on): those portions are off-key. I also missed seeing Siras’s relationship with his students : or, seeing the perfunctory nature of the department of Marathi that Siras heads at the Aligarh Muslim University (everyone in the film carefully leaves out the ‘Muslim’ whenever the name comes up), did he have any to speak of? Did he leave his native Maharashtra to seek refuge in Aligarh? But the film itself is bigger than these things. Like in his ‘Shahid’, Hansal Mehta and scriptwriter Apurva Asrani have come up with a lead character and a film which shines with authenticity and emotional heft, which leaves you thinking, and which says something we should all listen to, especially in these times when it has become more imperative than ever before: we can be different, but we are us.

Manoj Bajpayee plays Dr Shrinivas Ramachandra Siras and Rajkummar Rao essays the role of journalist Deepu Sebastian. Hansal Mehta may have named his film after a place but Aligarh is essentially an individual’s film. It is about one person at a traumatic juncture in his life; an acutely observed, dignified and sympathetic character study of a violated man. Dr Shrinivas Ramachandra Siras, who was ousted from Aligarh Muslim University for homosexuality, was later found dead under mysterious circumstances. The retelling of his life is addressed against the backdrop of the contentious issue of criminalisation of homosexuality in India. The film’s strength lies in capturing the personality and psyche of Siras. Not just as he looks from outside but more so his inner life: his loneliness, advancing age and the betrayal and humiliation in the winter of his life. So you have Manoj Bajpayee, with method acting at its peak, interpreting Siras in his own way: working at that fidgety gait, the halting voice and his love for Lata Mangeshkar captured through songs such as ‘ Aap ki nazron ne samjha ’ and ‘ Betaab dil ki tamanna yahi hai ’. There are some details that linger. Like how he dislikes the reduction of his passion for another man into a three-letter-word: gay. “It can’t quite capture the depth of my feelings,” he says. For him it’s an uncontrollable urge. If love is a word that needs to be felt and understood instead of being spelt out, the religion, according to him, is not something worth understanding because the minute you start putting your mind to it you will begin questioning your own beliefs and value systems. “The minute you put your mind to it, your beliefs and value system will disappear,” he says. There is his suppressed anger coming out at a young reporter hounding him, telling them that he is not a circus joker. Then there is his quirk of signing with his own pen; the blush that creeps up when he is told that he is handsome; how he talks about searching for true poetry in the silences and pauses between words; or when he takes refuge in poetry during court proceedings claiming to be a reluctant activist, unaware of the legalese. All he wants is to be left alone, with his dignity intact. Despite the underlying violence, physical as well as psychological, of the situation there is a quietude, gentleness and sincerity of treatment which heightens the larger, central debate of the film: should we be bothered about a person’s so-called immoral conduct or take up cudgels against society’s uncalled-for intrusion into the privacy of an individual? The shabby homes and the wintry, foggy, sinister air of a small North Indian town are captured well by the camera of Satya Nagpaul. What is better is the evocation of the town’s warped public moral compass; the gloomy university that took the lead in taking the scientific temper and progressive thoughts to the Muslims, yet started going downhill because of internal politics. However, it’s not just the one man at the centre. It’s also about his relationship with a gregarious, ambitious journalist Deepu Sebastian (Rajkummar Rao) who is initially out to get a good story but gradually becomes his confidante and sounding board. It’s a jugalbandi between the man of stillness and another with nervous energy. There are other idiosyncratic folks in the background who leave a great impression. Like KR Parmeshwar as Professor Sridharan, Siras’s colleague from the Malayalam department, and the two lawyers arguing in the courtroom over his dismissal. Ashish Vidyarthi is all solidity and strength as he argues for Siras. Mehta had Shalini Vatsa as a fierce rival lawyer in Shahid . Here he brings us face to face with an even fiercer one in Gauri Balaji. Aligarh opts to remain in a humane and heartfelt zone than become hard-hitting. Some elements don’t come together as well in the overall narrative. The attempt at humour with the “put the pump on” scenes doesn’t quite fly. Similarly, Deepu’s illicit passion paralleling Siras’s becomes too pat a way of driving home a point. And, the scene of Deepu realising the eventual tragedy doesn’t quite pack in an emotional wallop and feels too awkward and worked at. The film is a unique step forward in reality cinema in that it uses actual names of people and places involved in the real incident. But then it still has to put a disclaimer at the start.

Her obituaries were long and respectful, as befitted someone who had been prominent in wealthy Philadelphia society for more than 70 years. They emphasised her career as a highly eligible heiress and party girl in the Twenties, and as a lavish hostess after her marriage. They mentioned her doing the Charleston with Josephine Baker in Paris, dancing a foxtrot with the Duke of Windsor at El Morocco (\"He was pretty good\") and lunching with Sir Winston Churchill on Aristotle Onassis's yacht. But all the obituaries opened with the element in her life which had had some curious consequences far from the ordinary life of a wealthy socialite - and which made her indirectly responsible for James Stewart's only Oscar, the establishment of Katharine Hepburn as a major film star and, later, the popularity of the Christian name Tracy. For Hope Montgomery Scott was the inspiration for Tracy Lord, heroine of The Philadelphia Story. In 1940 the film was \"socko boffo\" in Variety-speak: winning Oscars and breaking box-office records. But since then it has retained its popularity, regularly featuring in lists of favourite films. The charm of this screwball comedy is obvious: a rich girl has doubts on the eve of her second marriage and, after an episode of self-discovery, remarries her first husband. Cary Grant as the husband and James Stewart as an intrusive reporter both give excellent performances. The humour is sophisticated, witty and bracingly anti-romantic. But it is the personality of Tracy Lord, incarnated by Katharine Hepburn, that compels: a character compounded of beauty, brains, wit, wealth, pedigree, position and, eventually, vulnerability. It had begun as a stage play. Philip Barry, a leading Broadway playwright, first had the idea early in 1938. His initial thought was of the dramatic potential of a wealthy family in the process of being studied for an article in Fortune magazine. He wrote well and amusingly about the lives of the rich because that was the world in which the Yale-educated, drawling, cocktail-drinking Barry moved. When he mentioned his play idea to his wife, she suggested the Main Line area of Philadelphia, the city's most fashionable address, as a setting. Barry agreed and began writing using Hope Montgomery Scott, the Main Line's most famous socialite, as a model for his heroine. Philadelphia society then exhibited an extreme type of class-consciousness. The flood of wealth that created American family fortunes in the late 19th century settled around a handful of cities and was expressed in different forms of conspicuous consumption and elaborate social behaviour - as chronicled by Edith Wharton in novels such as The Age of Innocence. In dynamic New York and Chicago, Vanderbilts and Astors, Fields and McCormicks vied with each other in glitter and the acquisition of European titles through their marriageable daughters, but mere wealth usually provided a sufficient entree to their society. In more traditional Boston and Philadelphia, however, society turned almost feudal, almost English in its attitudes - \"old\" money and \"old\" families counted for everything. The very term WASP (White Anglo-Saxon Protestant) was coined to describe members of Philadelphia society - its most characteristic institution was the Philadelphia Assemblies Ball. This is the oldest and most exclusive social gathering in the United States. Held every year since 1748, it is strictly reserved for members of the city's Social Register - no amount of money will allow entry; blood is everything. It was here, down the staircase to the great ballroom of the Bellevue-Stratford Hotel, that Hope Montgomery, in ballgown and elbow-length white kid gloves, made her entrance as a debutante in 1922. The daughter of Colonel Robert Montgomery, head of a wealthy and ancient Philadelphia family, she immediately made an impact. That evening she received four marriage proposals - none of which she accepted. The following year she met \"an older man\" at a Main Line dinner party, the 24-year-old Edgar Scott, heir to the Pennsylvania Railroad fortune (and an old classmate of Philip Barry). After a dozen dates they decided to marry, but her parents insisted they wait nine months. \"I always knew what I wanted, and so did Edgar. We both had the idea from the start that marriage should be something that lasts forever. And it did.\" It was inevitably described as the Society Wedding of the Year, and exhaustively chronicled by the press down to the orange blossoms that banked the church. The couple moved into Orchard Lodge, a 1720 fieldstone house which her father had given her as a wedding present. It lies on the Montgomerys' 750-acre Ardrossan estate on the Main Line, only a mile across an enormous lawn from \"the big house\", the 45-room Georgian mansion where Hope had grown up. As a young wife, Hope Scott began to feature on the New York Couture Group's annual list of best-dressed women, and patronised the salons of many famous names, both in New York and Paris, such as Mainbocher, Falkenstein and Piguet. Her beauty and her slim, angular figure (size eight throughout her life) was much photographed and painted. Cecil Beaton took several portraits of her, and Augustus John painted her twice during her visit to Ireland in 1930. \"Though I was sitting for Augustus John, I did not lack exercise. Most of his models found themselves doing a good bit of sprinting round the studio,\" she later recalled. One night John was prevented from climbing into her bed by the presence of a bolster beside her, which he angrily mistook for a fellow painter staying in the house. The Scotts entertained, and were entertained, in a grand manner. \"Everybody had so much money - there were so few taxes. People gave grand dinner parties and dances: women wore wonderful dresses and men came in fine evening clothes,\" she remembered. \"It's a way of life that's completely gone now. It was really an imitation of Edwardian days in England. It was all quite artificial. \"When Phil told me he had written this new play, and that Katharine Hepburn would play me, I thought it was great fun, but I really didn't pay that much attention. I don't really think Tracy Lord was like me, except that she was very energetic and motivated.\" Barry took his idea for a comedy, based on the glamorous figure of Hope Scott, to Katharine Hepburn - who had made a great success of the society girl with brains and beauty in the film version of his play Holiday. His proposal came at just the right moment for Hepburn: her career as an actress both on Broadway and in Hollywood was at a turning point. Her films, including some which we now consider among her finest, Bringing Up Baby and Holiday, were not commercial successes, and the studios considered Hepburn too independent and unconventional. Shortly after Bringing Up Baby's release, Harry Brandt, president of the Independent Theatre Owners of America, published as an advertisement a list of stars who were \"box-office poison\"; Hepburn's name was at the top. She was in good company, with Fred Astaire, Joan Crawford, Marlene Dietrich and Greta Garbo, but the publicity damaged Hepburn in the eyes of both studios and public, and after being offered a very B-movie project, she bought her way out of her contract with RKO, vowing to return only on her own terms. Hepburn liked the idea for The Philadelphia Story, and after she had been rejected for the role of Scarlett O'Hara in Gone With The Wind (the part for an actress in 1938) she threw herself into assisting both the writing and production. Barry developed the play as a vehicle for Hepburn. The focus moved from the family under threat from the press on the eve of Tracy Lord's second wedding, to its heroine's transformation from priggish \"ice goddess\" to vulnerable and compassionate \"real woman\". Hepburn, like Hope Scott, was of wealthy East Coast patrician stock, but of an entirely different stamp. Her mother was a Houghton, a member of one of the leading business dynasties in the United States: Hepburn and her cousins today share a family fortune of around $500 million. Kit Houghton Hepburn, a strong-minded and independent woman, chose a husband against her family's wishes. He was Tom Hepburn, a surgeon, the son of an Episcopalian preacher - impoverished but of good family. Their first child, Katharine, grew up in Hartford, Connecticut, as sporty and outdoorsy as Hope Scott, but also in a household that was filled with books and radical ideas - campaigns for female suffrage, family planning, prevention of venereal disease. Educated at the Ivy League college Bryn Mawr, Hepburn also took pride in belonging to the breed of Connecticut Yankees - clever, principled, disciplined, and smart as a whip. Barry turned the part of Tracy Lord into a showcase for Hepburn's character, wit and intelligence. The critic David Thomson wrote: \"Like Jane Austen's Emma Woodhouse, she was a moral being, sometimes at odds with herself, deluded or mistaken, but able to correct herself out of a grave and resilient honesty. Nobody on the screen could be so funny and so moving in making a fool of herself, or so touching in reclaiming her dignity.\" There were difficulties raising money for the Broadway production, but eventually half the costs were met by Howard Hughes, at the time the richest and most eligible bachelor in the United States. He and Hepburn had had a summer affair in 1937, which, after much speculation about marriage, had dwindled into good friendship. Presciently, Hughes suggested that Hepburn should obtain the film rights to the play, and eventually bought them for her. The Philadelphia Story opened at the Shubert Theatre in New York on March 29, 1939. The audience loved it, and the critics complied with rave reviews. Hope Scott commented after the first night: \"We were thrilled. But I was amazed because I didn't think we were all that interesting to write about.\" The public disagreed. Its final takings (for 415 performances) were over $ 1,500,000 - which was good news for Hepburn, since she had foregone any salary in return for 10 per cent of the gross. Within weeks of the opening, offers were arriving from Hollywood for the screen rights. Hepburn finally accepted $250,000 from MGM, not the highest bid, but MGM would give her approval of her leading men and director. She naturally chose George Cukor to direct (he was a key supporter of Hepburn's film career and had directed her in Bill of Divorcement and Holiday). For leading men she wanted Spencer Tracy and Clark Gable, but neither was available. She settled for Cary Grant, who insisted on top billing (which he got), and James Stewart. The Bristol-born Grant eventually gave his entire fee of $ 150,000 to the British war effort. The film opened to enormous critical acclaim and broke box-office records around the country. Among its Oscar nominations in 1940 were Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress. In the end only James Stewart (Best Actor) and Donald Ogden Stewart (Best Screenplay) won. Hepburn lost to Ginger Rogers, but there was no doubt that it was her picture. The slur of \"box-office poison\" had finally been refuted. Hepburn had made the part of Tracy Lord so much her own that it might have seemed hubris for anyone to try to compete. But when MGM decided to add Cole Porter to The Philadelphia Story, and make a musical called High Society, Grace Kelly had just become engaged to Prince Rainier of Monaco and thus become the most famous Philadelphian in the world. In her short film career between 1951 and 1956, Grace Kelly became Hollywood's own princess. As with Hepburn, anything she did reeked of class. In fact, although she came from a prominent and wealthy family in Philadelphia, Grace Kelly was not part of the city's exclusive society. How could she be - an Irish-American Catholic, whose brilliantly successful but self-made father had begun his career as a bricklayer? Kelly later revealed to her friend Judy Kanter that it had been one of her dreams to \"come out\" as a debutante at the Philadelphia Assemblies Ball in a white dress and elbow-length white kid gloves, as Hope Montgomery had. But that had been an impossible fantasy. As her biographer, Robert Lacey, observes, she \"was an outsider, an excluded observer of a world that was held to be the ultimate in terms of class and privilege - which may be one reason why she made such a good job of mimicking the style and customs of that world in her later life\". Kelly, also, was famously described as a \"snow-covered volcano\" by Alfred Hitchcock. The director knew so well how to hint on the screen at the passion beneath the pure exterior, just as the besotted Spy journalist Macaulay Connor delightedly discovers the \"fires banked down, hearthfires and holocausts\" in the champagne-fuelled Tracy Lord. In the event, Cole Porter's music filled the gap between Kelly's creditable performance and the memory of Hepburn's virtuoso one, and the 1956 film of High Society was a huge success. Such was the glamour of Kelly's Tracy Lord, that in Britain, a generation of now-thirtysomethings were named after her. The critic and star-worshipper Kenneth Tynan had already named his daughter Tracy in 1952 - and had taken care to have Katharine Hepburn as the godmother. For him, of the three versions, Tracy Lord would always be Hepburn: \"the keeper of the flame, the woman of the year, Adam's rib, and the star-spangled girl\". © 1995 The Telegraph Group Limited Return to the THE PHILADELPHIA STORY main page.

CREDITS Producer Director Music Director Stars Navketan Vijay Anand S D Burman Dev Anand, Waheeda Rehman, Kishore Sahu This odyssey is mainly prompted by the rupture of Raju's relationship with his grey-shaded-as-well love, Rosie; and the portrayal of this tempestuous love affair is a major plus point for the film. Based on R K Narayan's novel, The Guide, the film has as its protagonist Raju (Dev Anand), a glib-talking tourist guide. He meets Rosie first when she is already married. Her much-older, archaeologist husband Marco (Kishore Sahu, noted actor-director of the 1940s who also directed the Meena Kumari hit Dil Apna Aur Preet Parayi) hires Raju as their guide while on a holiday. The rather dried-up Marco is shown more comfortable with his explorations in a cave than with his beautiful trophy wife. Not surprisingly, an attraction soon develops between Raju and the repressed-by-her-husband (he won't let her cultivate her dancing abilities), but full-of-vitality Rosie. Raju's love and support gives the unfulfilled Rosie the courage to make bold and defy societal norms by leaving the oppressive atmosphere of her husband's house and moving into Raju's abode. Her sheer exultation in her new freedom is beautifully captured in her crucial song --- Kaaton se kheench ke anchal, chhod ke bandhan bandhe payal. It is evident in her dancing on the edge of a ledge in keeping with her dangerous new desires; in her riding in a cart and breaking a pot, thereby metaphorically breaking all conventions.

The film takes you beyond the happily ever after. What happens after a love match fructifies? With Raju's glib managerial skills, Rosie becomes a dancing star. But insecurity soon manifests itself. Raju takes to drinking and gambling. His fear of losing his love makes Raju forge a cheque in Rosie's name. She finds it hard to forgive him, and he is sentenced to prison. When he emerges from prison, he rejects his earlier life. He is mistaken as a holy man by some villagers and goes along with their belief. Misery, it is said, can lead to sublimity. Circumstances make Raju go on a 12-day fast to propitiate the Gods for rain, and leads him to ponder over and seek answers to the ultimate spiritual question. In the end, the Guide finds the path to his own emotional salvation. Dev Anand in what is probably his most famous role is never less than convincing as the guide with all-too-human failings, but also blessed with a higher self. Waheeda Rehman effectively conveys her character's repressed energy and desires through her many breathtaking dances.

Her sheer exultation in her new freedom is beautifully captured in her crucial song --- Kaaton se kheench ke anchal, chhod ke bandhan bandhe payal. It is evident in her dancing on the edge of a ledge in keeping with her dangerous new desires; in her riding in a cart and breaking a pot, thereby metaphorically breaking all conventions. Raju even defies his mother (Leela Chitnis) for his unconventional love. Rosie flowers because of his strengths. Does she have the heart to forgive his weaknesses too? The film takes you beyond the happily ever after. What happens after a love match fructifies? With Raju's glib managerial skills, Rosie becomes a dancing star. But insecurity soon manifests itself. Raju takes to drinking and gambling. His fear of losing his love makes Raju forge a cheque in Rosie's name. She finds it hard to forgive him, and he is sentenced to prison. When he emerges from prison, he rejects his earlier life. He is mistaken as a holy man by some villagers and goes along with their belief. Misery, it is said, can lead to sublimity. Circumstances make Raju go on a 12-day fast to propitiate the Gods for rain, and leads him to ponder over and seek answers to the ultimate spiritual question. In the end, the Guide finds the path to his own emotional salvation. Dev Anand in what is probably his most famous role is never less than convincing as the guide with all-too-human failings, but also blessed with a higher self. Waheeda Rehman effectively conveys her character's repressed energy and desires through her many breathtaking dances. She's subtle as ever, and her expressive eyes flash fire as well as frighteningly cold rage. Director Vijay Anand handles the complex subject with maturity and flair. He adopts a largely non-judgemental stand, interestingly evident in this musically-blessed film's two back-to-back Point Of View songs. When the lead couple have an acrimonious fall out, the heroine sings Mohse chhal kiye jaaye while the hero counters with Kya se kya ho gaya bewafa. It is almost as if the director presents both the sides and lets you make up your mind. Sidelights: * Guide was not a blockbuster; it was more of a prestige film. It won the Best Director, Best Actor and Best Actress Filmfare Awards for Vijay Anand, Dev and Waheeda respectively. * The English version directed by Tad Danielski was released beforehand. It left little impact. * For director Vijay Anand it was an early peak. His trendsetting thriller Teesri Manzil was also released within a year. Incidentally, Chetan Anand was to direct Guide first; then Raj Khosla was considered, but Waheeda and Khosla had fallen out during Solva Saal so Vijay Anand ended up directing the film.

Vijay Anand's Guide is a celluloid tone poem which gently leads us through the story of a passionate soul, Raju Guide, imbued with his fair share of venalities --- ambitions, insecurities and jealousies -- and his journey towards his eventual redemption. CREDITS Producer Director Music Director Stars Navketan Vijay Anand S D Burman Dev Anand, Waheeda Rehman, Kishore Sahu This odyssey is mainly prompted by the rupture of Raju's relationship with his grey-shaded-as-well love, Rosie; and the portrayal of this tempestuous love affair is a major plus point for the film. Based on R K Narayan's novel, The Guide, the film has as its protagonist Raju (Dev Anand), a glib-talking tourist guide. He meets Rosie first when she is already married. Her much-older, archaeologist husband Marco (Kishore Sahu, noted actor-director of the 1940s who also directed the Meena Kumari hit Dil Apna Aur Preet Parayi) hires Raju as their guide while on a holiday. The rather dried-up Marco is shown more comfortable with his explorations in a cave than with his beautiful trophy wife.

Circumstances make Raju go on a 12-day fast to propitiate the Gods for rain, and leads him to ponder over and seek answers to the ultimate spiritual question. In the end, the Guide finds the path to his own emotional salvation. Dev Anand in what is probably his most famous role is never less than convincing as the guide with all-too-human failings, but also blessed with a higher self. Waheeda Rehman effectively conveys her character's repressed energy and desires through her many breathtaking dances. She's subtle as ever, and her expressive eyes flash fire as well as frighteningly cold rage. Director Vijay Anand handles the complex subject with maturity and flair. He adopts a largely non-judgemental stand, interestingly evident in this musically-blessed film's two back-to-back Point Of View songs. When the lead couple have an acrimonious fall out, the heroine sings Mohse chhal kiye jaaye while the hero counters with Kya se kya ho gaya bewafa. It is almost as if the director presents both the sides and lets you make up your mind. Sidelights: * Guide was not a blockbuster; it was more of a prestige film. It won the Best Director, Best Actor and Best Actress Filmfare Awards for Vijay Anand, Dev and Waheeda respectively. * The English version directed by Tad Danielski was released beforehand. It left little impact. * For director Vijay Anand it was an early peak. His trendsetting thriller Teesri Manzil was also released within a year.

Watch Live News: Follow Us: ................................ Advertisement ................................ Guide featured Dev Anand and Waheeda Rehman in the lead.HighlightsAuthor R K Narayan hated the film adaptation of his acclaimed novel, but Guide (1965) is widely considered a masterpiece of Indian cinema and among the best work of its stars Dev Anand and Waheeda Rehman. S D Burman gave Bollywood some it's most beautiful music in this film. It was also one of the highlights of the portfolio of Navketan Films, the production house run by Dev Anand and his brothers Chetan and Vijay. Did you know: Guide was made in both Hindi and English. The Hindi version, directed by Vijay Anand, was a blockbuster. The English version, written by Pearl S Buck and directed by American Tad Danielewski, never saw light of day till it was screened at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival, 42 years after it was made. Vijay Anand was horrified by the story of Rosie, the dancer who leaves her husband, and Raju the guide who spirals through alcoholism and ends up a godman in a remote, parched village. He refused to direct the film twice, claiming it would be bad international PR for India. Dev Anand convinced him on the third try. The famous song Aaj phir jeene ki tamanna hai, picturised on Waheeda Rehman, was shot in Rajasthan's Chittorgarh Fort. In one shot, a reflection of Waheeda is seen in a mirror. This was inspired by the legend of Alauddin Khilji catching a glimpse of Rani Padmini in the same mirror. S D Burman, Dev Anand's favourite music director, fell seriously ill while he was working Guide's score. Dev Anand waited for S D Burman to recover instead of replacing him. The first line of the song Din dhal jaye was written by Hasrat Jaipuri, the film's original lyricist. Dev and Vijay Anand didn't like the line and wanted Hasrat Jaipuri to drop it. He refused and quit. The brothers then asked Shailendra to take over as lyricist. Shailendra, unhappy with being their second choice, quoted a very high fee to which Dev and Vijay Anand agreed. He came up with the mukgda for Gaata rahe mera dil by the time the meeting was over. Ironically, Shailendra kept Hasrat Jaipuri's offending line and the song is considered a Bollywood classic. Dev Anand met David Selznick when Guide premiered in New York. David Selznick wanted to cast Dev in a film to be shot in Kashmir, but died of a heart attack before the project could begin. Chetan Anand, Dev and Vijay's elder brother, wanted them to cast Priya Rajvansh as Rosie the dancer because she spoke better English than Waheeda Rehman, and so would be better suited for the English version of the film. Dev Anand refused to cast anyone but Waheeda. Not only did Waheeda deliver a career-best performance, she also improved her English with some help from Pearl S Buck. Yash Johar was the production controller for Navketan Films and served as assistant director for Guide. Karan Johar revealed decades later that his father tricked Dev Anand into filming a song sequence at what the actor thought was Rohtang Pass. Actually, it was many kilometres short of Rohtang Pass. The crew, tired of trekking up, had simply repainted a milestone to say Rohtang Pass 0.
