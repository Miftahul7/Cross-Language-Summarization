Paul Krugman, in full Paul Robin Krugman, (born February 28, 1953, Albany, New York, U.S.), American economist and journalist who received the 2008 Nobel Prize for Economics for his work in economic geography and in identifying international trade patterns. He was also known for his op-ed column in The New York Times. Krugman was awarded a B.A. from Yale University in 1974 and a Ph.D. from MIT in 1977. He served as a member of MIT’s economics faculty from 1979 to 2000, leaving for a year (1982–83) to work as the chief staffer for international economics on U.S. Pres. Ronald Reagan’s Council of Economic Advisers and again for a hiatus (1994–96) to teach at Stanford University. From 1979 he also worked as a research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research. In 2000 he became a professor of economics and international affairs at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University; he retired in 2015 as professor emeritus. He subsequently became a professor at the City University of New York’s Graduate Center. Through the integration of economies of scale into general equilibrium models, Krugman furthered understanding of both the determinants of trade and the location of production in an increasingly globalized post-World War II economy. His research findings explained how the consumer’s desire for variety and choice enabled countries to achieve the economies of scale required for profitable trade in similar products. This led to later research on the “new economic geography,” which explained the location of jobs and businesses and the reason there was acceleration in the pace of urbanization and a population decline in rural areas. A prolific writer, Krugman published more than 20 books and 200 papers in professional journals. Among his writings were regular magazine columns in Slate (1996–99) and Fortune (1997–99), and from 1999 he was an op-ed columnist for The New York Times. His books included the essay collection The Great Unraveling: Losing Our Way in the New Century (2003), which criticized the administration of Pres. George W. Bush; economics textbooks such as Microeconomics (2004) and Macroeconomics (2005); and nonacademic works such as The Return of Depression Economics (1999), The Conscience of a Liberal (2007), and Arguing with Zombies: Economics, Politics, and the Fight for a Better Future (2020). In addition to the Nobel Prize, Krugman received many honours, including the 1991 John Bates Clark medal, awarded to economists under age 40.

He demonstrated that plants are also sensitive to heat, cold, light, noise and various other external stimuli. Bose contrived a very sophisticated instrument called the crescograph, which could record and observe plants minute responses to external stimulants. It was capable of magnifying the motion of plant tissues to about 10,000 times of their actual size and, in doing so, found many similarities between plants and other living organisms. Jagadish Chandra Bose was born on 30 November, 1858 at Mymensingh, now in Bangladesh. He was raised in a home committed to pure Indian traditions and culture. He received his elementary education from a vernacular school, because his father believed that Bose should learn his own mother tongue, Bengali, before studying a foreign language like English. Later he attended St. Xavier’s School at Kolkata and passed the Entrance Examination for Calcutta University. Bose attended the University of Cambridge studying natural sciences after graduating with a physics degree from Calcutta University. He returned to India in 1884 after completing his B.Sc. degree from Cambridge University and was appointed professor of physical science at Presidency College, Calcutta (now Kolkata). In 1917 Bose left his professorship and established the Bose Institute at Calcutta which was initially devoted principally to the study of plants. He was its director for twenty years until his death. The central hall of the Royal Society in London was jam-packed with famous scientists on May 10, 1901. Everyone seemed to be curious to know how Bose’s experiment will demonstrate that plants have feelings like other living beings and humans. Bose chose a plant whose roots were cautiously dipped up to its stem in a vessel holding the bromide solution, which is considered a poison. He plugged in the instrument with the plant and viewed the lighted spot on a screen showing the movements of the plant, as its pulse beat, and the spot began to and fro movement similar to a pendulum. Within minutes, the spot vibrated in a violent manner and finally came to an abrupt stop. The whole thing was almost like a poisoned rat fighting against death. The plant had died due to the exposure to the poisonous bromide solution. The event was greeted with much appreciation and applause; however some physiologists were not content, and considered Bose as an intruder. They harshly knocked the experiment but Bose did not give up and was confident about his findings. Using the crescograph, he further researched the response of the plants to fertilizers, light rays and wireless waves. The instrument received widespread acclaim, particularly from the Path Congress of Science in 1900. Many physiologists also supported his findings later on, using more advanced instruments. Bose authored two illustrious books; ‘Response in the Living and Non-living’ (1902) and ‘The Nervous Mechanism of Plants’ (1926). He also extensively researched the behavior of radio waves. Mostly known as a plant physiologist, he was actually a physicist. Bose made improvements on another instrument called ‘the coherer’, for detecting the radio waves. He was knighted in 1917 and elected the Fellow of the Royal Society in 1920 for his amazing contributions and achievements. He died aged 78, on 23 November in 1937, in Giridih, India.

He demonstrated that plants are also sensitive to heat, cold, light, noise and various other external stimuli. Bose contrived a very sophisticated instrument called the crescograph, which could record and observe plants minute responses to external stimulants. It was capable of magnifying the motion of plant tissues to about 10,000 times of their actual size and, in doing so, found many similarities between plants and other living organisms. Advertisements Early Life and Career Path: Jagadish Chandra Bose was born on 30 November, 1858 at Mymensingh, now in Bangladesh. He was raised in a home committed to pure Indian traditions and culture. He received his elementary education from a vernacular school, because his father believed that Bose should learn his own mother tongue, Bengali, before studying a foreign language like English. Later he attended St. Xavier’s School at Kolkata and passed the Entrance Examination for Calcutta University. Bose attended the University of Cambridge studying natural sciences after graduating with a physics degree from Calcutta University. He returned to India in 1884 after completing his B.Sc. degree from Cambridge University and was appointed professor of physical science at Presidency College, Calcutta (now Kolkata). In 1917 Bose left his professorship and established the Bose Institute at Calcutta which was initially devoted principally to the study of plants. He was its director for twenty years until his death. Famous Experiment: The central hall of the Royal Society in London was jam-packed with famous scientists on May 10, 1901. Everyone seemed to be curious to know how Bose’s experiment will demonstrate that plants have feelings like other living beings and humans. Bose chose a plant whose roots were cautiously dipped up to its stem in a vessel holding the bromide solution, which is considered a poison. He plugged in the instrument with the plant and viewed the lighted spot on a screen showing the movements of the plant, as its pulse beat, and the spot began to and fro movement similar to a pendulum. Within minutes, the spot vibrated in a violent manner and finally came to an abrupt stop. The whole thing was almost like a poisoned rat fighting against death. The plant had died due to the exposure to the poisonous bromide solution. The event was greeted with much appreciation and applause; however some physiologists were not content, and considered Bose as an intruder. They harshly knocked the experiment but Bose did not give up and was confident about his findings. Using the crescograph, he further researched the response of the plants to fertilizers, light rays and wireless waves. The instrument received widespread acclaim, particularly from the Path Congress of Science in 1900. Many physiologists also supported his findings later on, using more advanced instruments. Later Life and Death: Bose authored two illustrious books; ‘Response in the Living and Non-living’ (1902) and ‘The Nervous Mechanism of Plants’ (1926). He also extensively researched the behavior of radio waves. Mostly known as a plant physiologist, he was actually a physicist. Bose made improvements on another instrument called ‘the coherer’, for detecting the radio waves. He was knighted in 1917 and elected the Fellow of the Royal Society in 1920 for his amazing contributions and achievements. He died aged 78, on 23 November in 1937, in Giridih, India.

Sir Jagadish Chandra Bose, Jagadish also spelled Jagadis, (born November 30, 1858, Mymensingh, Bengal, India (now in Bangladesh)—died November 23, 1937, Giridih, Bihar), Indian plant physiologist and physicist whose invention of highly sensitive instruments for the detection of minute responses by living organisms to external stimuli enabled him to anticipate the parallelism between animal and plant tissues noted by later biophysicists. Bose’s experiments on the quasi-optical properties of very short radio waves (1895) led him to make improvements on the coherer, an early form of radio detector, which have contributed to the development of solid-state physics. After earning a degree from the University of Cambridge (1884), Bose served as professor of physical science (1885–1915) at Presidency College, Calcutta (now Kolkata), which he left to found and direct (1917–37) the Bose Research Institute (now Bose Institute) in Calcutta. To facilitate his research, he constructed automatic recorders capable of registering extremely slight movements; these instruments produced some striking results, such as Bose’s demonstration of an apparent power of feeling in plants, exemplified by the quivering of injured plants. His books include Response in the Living and Non-Living (1902) and The Nervous Mechanism of Plants (1926).

", "", " Home • Contents FOCUS: BOSE INSTITUTE A versatile genius BY SPECIAL ARRANGEMENT J.C. Bose, centre, with his students Meghnad Saha, J.C. Ghosh (both sitting), S. Dutta, S.N. Bose, D.M. Bose, N.R. Sen, J.N. Mukherjee and N.C. Nag. JAGADISH CHANDRA BOSE (1858-1937) was a rare polymath who was equally at home in physics, biology, botany, archaeology and literature. Born in what is now Bangladesh, he graduated in science from St. Xaviers College, Calcutta (now Kolkata), and later obtained an honours in Physics from Cambridge University, in 1884. He was appointed a Professor of Physics in Presidency College, Calcutta, in 1885, where he conducted experiments in various areas in physics and botany. To begin with, he invented a wireless telegraphy equipment in 1894 and demonstrated it at the Town Hall in Calcutta. So, in a way, he invented the radio contemporaneously with Marconi of Italy. But J.C. Bose never got international recognition for it owing to his failure to patent it in time. Bose presented a very important paper at the International Congress of Physics held in Paris in 1900, titled \"On the Similarity of Responses in Inorganic and Living Matter\". To prove his point he had devised instruments such as the crescograph to measure the rate of growth of a plant and the death recorder to record the exact moment of death of a plant. Thus, from a study of electromagnetic waves, especially its property and practical application, J.C. Bose turned increasingly to the study of plants and what later came to be known as biophysics. He compared the response of metals, plants and animals to electrical, chemical and mechanical stimulations, and documented them in his famous book, Responses in the Living and Non-living, published in 1902. The instruments and apparatus is he patented were for measuring the response to stimulations of heat, light, gravity and electricity. It was this paper rather than his work on radio waves that made him an instant celebrity in the world of science. A leading French newspaper of that time wrote humorously: \"After this discovery we begin to have misgivings, when we strike a woman with a blossom, which of them suffers more - the woman or the flower!\" After retiring from Presidency College in 1915, he established the Bose Institute (Basu Bigyan Mandir) in 1917 and carried on with his research work there until his death. He was conferred the Knighthood in 1916 and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Science (FRS), England, in 1920. His important publications include Plant Response as a Means of Physiological investigations, Physiology of Photosynthesis, Nervous Mechanism of Plants and Motor Mechanisms of Plants. But Sir J.C. Bose was not just a scholar, scientist and inventor. He was also an ardent nationalist. One can gauge his patriotism, courage, integrity and self-respect from the fact that for three years after joining government service in Presidency College, he refused to accept any salary from the British government, since the latter discriminated in the matter of pay scales between British and Indian Professors. Finally, the colonial authorities had to give in and allow him the full salary from the day he joined the college. He realised that the best way to fight the colonial injustice was to confront it head on. J.C. Bose's versatile genius found expression in literary works also, such as Abyakta (literal translation: The Unexpressed), which is still regarded by literary critics as a masterly exposition of the beauty of natural phenomena. In recognition of his literary works, he was made the president of the Bangiya Sahitya Parishad (the apex body of the State-level literary council for the Bengali language and literature). He was also a close friend of the poet Rabindranath Tagore, Swami Vivekananda, Sister Nivedita, and Mahatma Gandhi. Among eminent scholars abroad, he won the admiration of George Bernard Shaw, Aldous Huxley and Romain Rolland. What all these savants appreciated most was Bose's attempt to prove the age-old humanist faith in the basic unity of all life. A British editor once wrote: \"In Sir Jagadish the culture of 30 centuries has blossomed into a scientific brain of an order which we cannot duplicate in the West.\" Printer friendly page Send this article to Friends by E-Mail Subscribe | Contact Us | Archives | Contents (Letters to the Editor should carry the full postal address) [ Home | The Hindu | Business Line | Sportstar Copyright © 2004, Frontline.

One can gauge his patriotism, courage, integrity and self-respect from the fact that for three years after joining government service in Presidency College, he refused to accept any salary from the British government, since the latter discriminated in the matter of pay scales between British and Indian Professors. Finally, the colonial authorities had to give in and allow him the full salary from the day he joined the college. He realised that the best way to fight the colonial injustice was to confront it head on. J.C. Bose's versatile genius found expression in literary works also, such as Abyakta (literal translation: The Unexpressed), which is still regarded by literary critics as a masterly exposition of the beauty of natural phenomena. In recognition of his literary works, he was made the president of the Bangiya Sahitya Parishad (the apex body of the State-level literary council for the Bengali language and literature). He was also a close friend of the poet Rabindranath Tagore, Swami Vivekananda, Sister Nivedita, and Mahatma Gandhi. Among eminent scholars abroad, he won the admiration of George Bernard Shaw, Aldous Huxley and Romain Rolland. What all these savants appreciated most was Bose's attempt to prove the age-old humanist faith in the basic unity of all life.

Bose turned increasingly to the study of plants and what later came to be known as biophysics. He compared the response of metals, plants and animals to electrical, chemical and mechanical stimulations, and documented them in his famous book, Responses in the Living and Non-living, published in 1902. The instruments and apparatus is he patented were for measuring the response to stimulations of heat, light, gravity and electricity. It was this paper rather than his work on radio waves that made him an instant celebrity in the world of science. A leading French newspaper of that time wrote humorously: \"After this discovery we begin to have misgivings, when we strike a woman with a blossom, which of them suffers more - the woman or the flower!\" After retiring from Presidency College in 1915, he established the Bose Institute (Basu Bigyan Mandir) in 1917 and carried on with his research work there until his death. He was conferred the Knighthood in 1916 and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Science (FRS), England, in 1920.

That itself is a good reason to doubt such a romantic account. এছাড়াও, আমাদের কাছে থাকা সুদা হচ্ছে একমাত্র উৎস যেখানে হিরোডোটাস এর তার জন্ম স্থান করার ঘটনা রয়েছে। যা নিজেই এই ঘটনা সন্দেহ করার একটি ভালো কারণ হতে পারে। ভ্রমণের শুরু হিরোডোটাস এর মতে, হেলিকার্নাসাস একটি দোরীয় শহর থাকা সত্ত্বেও শহরটি একটি সীমাহীন বিবাদের পর সেটির পাশ্ববর্তী দোরীয়দের সাথে সম্পর্ক শেষ করে দেয় (I, 144) এবং মিশরের সাথে গ্রিকদের বাণিজ্যের ভিত্তি গড়তে সাহায্য করে। এটি একটি বহিঃমুখী আন্তর্জাতিক মানসিকতা সম্পন্ন সুযোগ ‍ছিল এবং হয়তো হিরোডোটাস এর পরিবারের পারস্য সম্রাজ্যের অধীনে থাকা অন্যান্য রাষ্ট্রের সাথে যোগাযোগ ছিল। এ কারণে হিরোডোটাস ভ্রমণ এবং গবেষণার সুযোগ পান। ৪৬০-৪৫৪ খ্রিষ্টপূর্বের মধ্যে একটি অ্যাথেনীয় বহর সেই পারস্যের শাসকের বিরুদ্ধে বিদ্রোহে সহায়তা করে। প্রতোক্ষপদর্শীদের মতে, তারপর ৪৫৪ খ্রিষ্টপূর্বের পূর্বে অথবা পরে তিনি মিশর ভ্রমণে যান। তারপর তিনি তায়ার এবং পরে ফোরাত থেকে ব্যাবিলন ভ্রমণে যান। কোনো কারণে, সম্ভব স্থানীয় রাজনীতির সাথে সম্পর্কিত কোনো বিষয়ের কারণে সে পরবর্তীকালে হেলির্কানাসাস এর মানুষের কাছে অপ্রিয় হয়ে যায়। তারপর তিনি পেরিক্লিয়ান অ্যাথেনস এ চলে যান এবং তিনি এ শহরের মানুষ এবং গণতান্ত্রিক সংগঠনগুলোর প্রকাশ্যে প্রশংসা করেন। এছাড়াও তিনি সেখানে তিনি স্থানীয় টোগ্রাফি সম্পর্কে জানেন এবং তার লেখায় প্রায়ই উল্লেখিত দল, অ্যাল্কমিওনিড সহ সেখানকার অগ্রসর মানুষদের সাথে পরিচিত হন। প্লুতার্কPlutarch De Malign. Herod. II p. 862 A, cited by এবং ইজুবাসEusebius Chron. Can. Pars. II p. 339, 01.83.4, cited by এর মতে হিরোডোটাসকে অ্যাথেনীয় সভা থেকে তার কীর্তির স্বীকৃতি স্বরুপ তাকে অথনৈতিক পুরস্কার প্রদান করা হয়। এটি এজন্য হতে পারে কারণ তিনি অ্যাথেনীয় নাগরিকত্ব চেয়েছিলেন, যা ৪৫১ সালের পর থেকে দুর্লভ সম্মান হয়ে দাড়ায় এবং তা লাভ করতে সভায় অনেকের উপস্থিত থাকা অবস্থায় দুটি ভিন্ন নির্বাচন প্রয়োজন হয়।যে কারনে তিনি ব্যর্থ হয়েছিলেন। পরবর্তী জীবন পরবর্তী জীবনে তিনি অ্যাথেনীয়দের অর্থায়নে থাকা অঞ্চল থুরিয়াম এ চলে যান। এরিস্টটল “থুরিয়াম এর হিরোডোটাস” এর লেখা “দ্যা হিসটোরিজ” একটি ভার্সনকে নির্দেশ করেছিলেন এবং তার হিরোডোটাস এর নিজের অভিজ্ঞতা থেকে দক্ষিণ ইতালি সম্পর্কে লেখার প্রমাণ হিসেবে হিসেবে “দ্যা হিসটোরিজ” এর কিছু রচনাংশকে ব্যাখ্যা করা হয়। পেলোপোনেসিয়ান যুদ্ধের প্রথম বছরের কিছু ঘটনা সম্পর্কে হিরোডোটাস এর অন্তরঙ্গ জ্ঞান নির্দেশ করে যে, তিনি হয়তো অ্যাথেনস এ ফিরে আসেন এবং এক্ষত্রে তিনি সেখানে একটি মহামারীতে আক্রান্ত হয়ে মৃত্যুবরণ করতে পারেন। অথবা তিনি মেসিডোনিয়ায় আদালতের তিনি পৃষ্ঠপোষকতা লাভ করার পর মৃত্যুবরণ করেন। অথবা, তিনি হয়তো থুরিয়ামেই মৃত্যুবরণ করতে পারেন। “দ্যা হিসটোরিজ” -এ ৪৩০ খ্রিষ্টপূর্বের পরে নিশ্চয়তা সহ কোনো তথ্য নেই। সাধারণত ধরে নেওয়া হয় তিনি এর পর খুব বেশি সময় বেঁচে থাকতে পারেন নি। লেখক এবং ওরাটর হিরোডোটাস তার গবেষণাগুলোকে মানুষের সামনে মৌখিক আবৃতি করে বৃহত্তর পৃথিবীকে জানাতেন। জন ম্যারিনকোলা “The Histories” এর Penguin edition ভূমিকায় লিখেছেন যে, হিরোডোটাস এর প্রথম দিকের বইগুলোতে কিছু শনাক্তযোগ্য অংশ আছে যাদের \"performance pieces\" বলা যেতে পারে। গবেষণার এই অংশগুলো স্বাধীন ধরে নেওয়া হয় এবং এগুলো প্রায় বিচ্ছিন্ন, আর তাই তারা লেখকের সাথে মৌখিকভাবে যুক্ত হতে পারে। পঞ্চম শতাব্দির মহান বুদ্ধিজীবী, মেরিনকোলা বিভিন্ন দার্শনিকের নাটকীয়ভাবে তাদের কর্মের এসব বিচ্ছিন্ন অংশের মৌখিক আবৃত্তিগুলোকে অন্তর্ভুক্ত করার পরামর্শ দেন। এসব আবৃত্তির উদ্দেশ্য ছিল যে, পূববর্তী বিতর্কের সমালোচনা করা এবং জোর দিয়ে এবং উৎসাহের সাথে নিজের য়ুক্তি দেওয়া। হিরোডোটাস দিবসে এ কারণে লেখকরা তাদের কর্ম প্রচলিতভাবে আবৃত্তির মাধ্যমে প্রকাশ করেন। লুসিয়ান এর মতে, হিরোডোটাস তার সমাপ্ত কর্ম আনাতুলিয়া থেকে অলিম্পিক ক্রীড়া প্রতিযোগিতায় নিয়ে যান এবং সেখানে বসে তিনি উপস্থিত দর্শকদের সামনে সম্পূর্ণ “The Histories” পড়ে শোনান এবং শেষে তিনি মানুষের সমর্থন লাভ করেন। একজন প্রাচীন ভাষাবিদের মতে, হিরোডোটাস অলেম্পিয়ার এই উৎসবে মেঘের একটু ছায়া পাওয়া পর্যন্ত “The Histories” পড়া শুরু করতে চাননি।Montfaucon’s Bibliothec. Coisl.

In the lifetime of Herodotus the writing of history, and indeed of prose of any sort, was still something of a novelty. The earliest writings in prose had been the work of a group of Greek intellectuals from the Ionian cities of Asia Minor who, from about 550 B.C. onward, wrote works on science and philosophy or on historical subjects. However, at this early date there were as yet few clear-cut distinctions between the various disciplines, and historical writing included much that today would be regarded rather as the concern of the geographer, the anthropologist, or the economist. Herodotus was heir to this tradition, and he was greatly influenced by his few predecessors, and especially by the ablest of them, Hecataeus of Miletus. Little is known of Herodotus's life beyond what can be deduced from his writings. He was born in 484 B.C., or perhaps a few years earlier, in Halicarnassus, a small Greek city on the coast of Asia Minor. His family was wealthy and perhaps aristocratic, but while he was still quite young they were driven from the city by a tyrant named Lygdamis. Herodotus lived for several years on the island of Samos and at a later date, is said to have returned to Halicarnassus to take part in the overthrow of the tyrant, but he did not remain there. Herodotus spent several years of his early manhood in unusually extensive traveling. One early trip was to the Black Sea, where he appears to have sailed along both the south and west coasts. Later he went by sea to the coast of Syria, then overland to the ancient city of Babylon, and on his way back he may have traveled through Palestine to Egypt. He certainly visited Egypt at least once, probably after 455 B.C. It is possible that he went on his travels primarily as a trader, for in his writings he shows great interest in the products and methods of transport of the countries he describes, and few Greeks of his generation could have afforded to make such lengthy journeys purely for pleasure. He made excellent use of his opportunities, inquiring everywhere about the customs and traditions of the lands through which he passed and amassing a great store of information of all kinds. About 450 B.C. Herodotus went to live for a time in Athens. During his stay there he is said to have become a close friend of the poet Sophocles. Another tradition, that he also became intimate with the great Athenian statesman Pericles, is much less reliable. After a time, however, Herodotus migrated to the Athenian colony of Thurii in southern Italy, which remained his home for the rest of his life. The date of his death is uncertain; the latest events he mentions in his writings took place in 430 B.C., and it is usually supposed that he died not long afterward. The writing of Herodotus's great work, the Histories (the name is simply a transliteration of a Greek word that means primarily \"inquiries\" or \"research\"), must have occupied a considerable portion of his later life, but we do not know when, where, or in what order it was written. In its final form it could not have been completed until the last years of his life, but parts were undoubtedly written much earlier, as we are told that he gave public readings from it while he was living in Athens. It is possible that he originally conceived his subject as being limited to the Persian attack on Greece made in 480, an event of his own boyhood, but in the end it expanded to embrace the whole history of the relations between the Greek world and Persia and the other kingdoms of Asia. The narrative of the Histories starts with the accession of Croesus, the last king of Lydia, and gives an account of his reign, including his conquest of the Asiatic Greeks and his overthrow by the Persian King Cyrus. These events take up the first half of Book I. (The division of the work into nine books is not Herodotus's own but was carried out later by Alexandrian scholars.) In the rest of Book I and the three following books the basic theme is the expansion of the Persian kingdom from the accession of Cyrus to about 500 B.C., but there are also several long digressions on the habits of the Persians and their subjects—the whole of Book II is one enormous digression on the customs and early history of Egypt. There are also several sections devoted to the history of some of the Greek states, and in particular, in a series of digressions, Herodotus gives us what is virtually a continuous history of Athens from 560 B.C. onward. Books V and VI cover primarily the lonian Revolt (499-494 B.C.) and the subsequent Persian expedition that was defeated by the Athenians at Marathon (490 B.C.), but again there are many digressions on contemporary events in the Greek states. In the last three books the story is rounded off by a detailed account, comparatively free from digressions, of the expedition of Xerxes (480-479 B.C.) and of its wholly unexpected defeat by the Greeks. In compiling the materials for his Histories Herodotus depended mainly on his own observations, the accounts of eyewitnesses on both sides, and, for earlier events, oral tradition. There was very little in the way of official records available to him, and few written accounts. The results of modern archeological investigations show that he was a remarkably accurate reporter of what he saw himself. But when he depended on others for information, he was not always critical enough in deciding what was reliable and what was not and in making due allowances for the bias of his informants. Herodotus was particularly uncritical in dealing with military operations, since he had no personal experience of warfare and therefore could not always assess accurately the military plausibility of the stories he heard. At the same time it is clear that he did not always believe what he was told and sometimes related stories of doubtful reliability because it was all he had, or because they were such good stories that he could not resist them. It is also sometimes said that he did not take enough care over matters of chronology, but it was very difficult indeed for anyone to work out and present a detailed and accurate chronological scheme in an age when every little Greek city-state had its own way of counting years and, often, its own calendar of months and days. Herodotus's chief weakness, however, lies in his often naive analysis of causes, which frequently ascribes events to the personal ambitions or weaknesses of leading men when, as his own narrative makes clear, there were wider political or economic factors at work. Herodotus wrote, in the Ionic dialect, a fascinating narrative in an attractively simple and easy-flowing style, and he had a remarkable gift for telling a story clearly and dramatically, often with a dry ironic sense of humor; the best of his stories have delighted, and will continue to delight, generations of readers. But Herodotus was much more than a mere storyteller. He was the first writer successfully to put together a long and involved historical narrative in which the main thread is never completely lost, however far and often he may wander from it. Moreover, he did this with a remarkable degree of detachment, showing hardly any of the Greeks' usual bias against the hereditary enemy, Persia, or of their contempt for barbarian peoples. And if he does not often achieve the depth of understanding of his great successor, Thucydides, his range of interests is much wider, embracing not only politics and warfare but also economics, geography, and the many strange and wonderful ways of mankind. He was the first great European historian, and the skill and honesty with which he built up his complex and generally reliable account and the great literary merit of his writing fully justify the title that has been bestowed on him: \"Father of History.\" The best short account of Herodotus's life is the one in the \"Introduction\" to vol. 1 of W. W. How and J. Wells, A Commentary on Herodotus (2 vols., 1912; rev. ed. 1928). Recommended longer accounts are Terrot R. Glover, Herodotus (1924), and the first half of John Linton Myres, Herodotus: Father of History (1953). More specialized is Henry R. Immerwahr, Form and Thought in Herodotus (1967). There is an excellent analysis of some of Herodotus's material in James A. K. Thomson, The Art of the Logos (1935). There are a number of works that deal with the developing art of historiography. Good but rather technical accounts of Herodotus's predecessors are in Lionel Pearson, Early Ionian Historians (1939). Chester G. Starr, The Awakening of the Greek Historical Spirit (1968), gives an interesting account of the early development of Greek historiography. There are useful comments in Arnold W. Gomme, The Greek Attitude to Poetry and History (1954). Herodotus is discussed in studies of classical historiography such as Stephen Usher, The Historians of Greece and Rome (1969), and Michael Grant, The Ancient Historians (1970). For background Aubrey de Selincourt, The World of Herodotus (1962), is lively but lacks depth. Good modern accounts of the period of history that Herodotus covered are in A. T. Olmstead, History of the Persian Empire: Achaemenid Period (1948), and A. R. Burn, Persia and the Greeks: The Defence of the West (1962).

Known as the \"Father of History,\" Herodotus (c. 484–424 B.C.E.) was born on the southwest coast of Asia Minor in Halicarnassus, which was at that time a Greek-speaking city ruled by Artemisia, queen of Caria, under the overlordship of the Persian Empire. Herodotus traveled widely in that empire and in Greece. Eventually, exiled from Halicarnassus, and having spent some years in Athens (where he gave regular readings of his work), he joined the new colony of Thurii in southern Italy, where he died. Herodotus is the author of the earliest surviving work of history and one of the masterpieces of Greek literature. It is owing to him that the word \"history\" came to mean what it does: he introduces his book as \"the inquiries (historiai ) of Herodotus of Halicarnassus.\" The usual title in English translations is The Histories. His purpose was to explore the interaction, peaceful and warlike, between Europe (particularly Greece) and Asia (particularly the Persian Empire). Some of his best stories are of kings, but he takes just as much interest in the adventures of differently privileged people—physicians, athletes, merchants, priests, and cooks. Book 2 of Herodotus's Histories focuses on Egypt (then subject to Persia) and North Africa. Books 1 and 3 include much information on Babylonia, Lydia, and other Persian provinces. Book 4 includes a survey of the peoples of Scythia (the Russian steppes). One of the means by which Herodotus characterizes peoples is through their food behavior. His descriptions of the Egyptians, Persians, and other highly civilized peoples among whom he had lived are far more nuanced than those of \"barbarian\" peoples, most of whom he knew only by hearsay. The underlying message to his audience is different in the two cases. He was rightly impressed by the long history of civilization in Egypt and Babylonia and by the efficiency of the Persians: he seems to encourage the reflection that the lifestyle of these peoples is logical in its own terms, sometimes more logical than that of the Greeks, and may have been instrumental in their successes. Barbarian tribes, by contrast, are shown as making stranger and stranger food choices as they recede farther and farther towards the edge of the world, from agriculturalists to pastoral nomads to cannibals. A structural anthropologist before the term was invented, Herodotus is not one to waste a promising structure. He asserts, and it is likely enough, that if the Persians took a decision while drunk, they made a rule to reconsider it when sober. Few authors between Herodotus and Lévi-Strauss would have dared to add, as Herodotus does, that if the Persians took a decision while sober, they made a rule to reconsider it when they were drunk (Histories, book 1, section 133). Herodotus is preeminent as a historian of the conflict of cultures. Throughout his work, food behavior is often the focus for sensitive and striking portrayals of culture clash. When Persian ambassadors visited the king of Macedonia, their stupidity in demanding the company of women at dinner, in conflict with local custom, was justly rewarded: the \"women\" who entered the dining hall were young men in disguise, armed with daggers, and the ambassadors were never heard of again (Histories, book 5, sections 18–20).

Historian Sources Acute Observer. Regarded as the “Father of History,” Herodotus wrote the first surviving work of history, a sprawling work essentially on the conflicts between Greeks and Persians, but containing a great deal of discursive material as well. Born in the cosmopolitan city of Halicarnassus on the Carian coast of what is now Turkey, Herodotus left for Samos due to political trouble and may not have returned. He was an inveterate traveller, visiting Egypt, Babylon and Thrace, and was always interested in recording foreign customs and beliefs. He visited Athens and seems to have been well received there: Sophocles wrote a poem for him, and his work left its impact on contemporary drama, both tragic and comic. He was one of the settlers of the panhellenic colony of Thurii in southern Italy (444/443 b.c.e.): events from 430 b.c.e., recorded in his history, give a terminus post quem for his death. Inquiry. The Greek word historie, with which Herodotus described his work, means “inquiry” rather than “record of past events.” Motivated though he be by an almost Homeric desire to record the great deeds of the Greeks and barbarians, there is no hint of divine inspiration as the source of his History of the Persian Wars (circa late fifth century b.c.e.): the information is hard won, the result of relentless questioning and listening. Often he will not give his opinion on a question, but will record what accounts different sources give: in this respect he differs markedly from his successor Thucydides, but precisely for this reason his writing can be a more useful and transparent source for further investigation than that of the more scientific historian. The digressionary style of the narrative, which is constantly interrupted by entertaining anecdotes, is shown at its most extreme in his long discussion of Egypt in book 2, most of which is at best of tangential relevance to its supposed motivation, the Persian invasion of that country. Furthermore, although he delights in telling of military stratagems, he took no part in the battles he describes and shows no real understanding of warfare—again a contrast with Thucydides. Yet, the comparison, although inevitable, is not really fair: the political and military focus of so much historical writing, starting with the later historian, was clearly not Herodotus’ main interest, and his ethnographical approach, his delight in the diversity and unity of humankind, does simply not allow such a narrow focus. Never afraid to step out of his own field of expertise, he seems to have been occasionally taken in by his guides and informants, and the impression of naivete this leaves is reinforced by a faith in religious phenomena, such as clearly manipulated oracles, which often seems to modern readers (and must have seemed to some of his contemporaries) simple-minded. However, his achievement is impressive when one sees his religious views woven into the whole of his narrative, as for instance when the defeat of the Persian forces is presented as part of a coherent pattern of divine punishment for arrogance.

It was something new, something unique. It was not a chronicle, nor was it a local history. It was historia<1>-- researches into a major event of the past. It is no coincidence that Herodotus wrote his work at this time. In his History Herodotus tells of the Persian Empire, its rise to the height of imperialism, and its faltering and ultimate collapse. Some say that Athens, too, had reached the height of her imperialism, and the Peloponnesian war would bring to Athens what the war Herodotus wrote about brought to Persia. The author of the History wanted to do more than retell the events of the past, he want to prove a point and make sure the people of the future remembered and learned from the events of the past. He did not want to relate his story. He wanted to relate history. The Life and Travels of Herodotus People sometimes let their own experiences filter the way they interpret the events of the past. For this reason it is important that anyone seeking to study the work of another--whether a history, a diary, or even a personal letter--should devote some effort to the study of that person's life. Only then can a student of history effectively judge the work of the historian in its proper light. Was the author trying to make a point? Was he hoping to convince the reader of something? If there is some deeper meaning to the history that someone creates, the key to unlocking that meaning will be found in his past. The man known to history as Herodotus is believed to have been born in Halikarnassos around 484 BC. Most of what is know about him comes from a tenth century Byzantine lexicon, the Souda, and even that is incredibly brief: Herodotus, the son of Lyxes and Dryo, a man of Halicarnassus, belonged to a prominent family and had a brother, Theodoros. He emigrated to Samos because of Lygdamis, the tyrant of Halicarnassus, the third in line after Artemisia. For the son of Artemisia was Pisindelis, and Lydgamis was Pisindelis's son. While in Samos, he mastered the Ionic dialect, and wrote a history in nine books, starting with Cyrus the Persian, and Candaules, the king of the Lydians. He returned to Halicarnassus and drove out the tyrant, but afterward, when he saw that he was hated by the citizens, he went as a volunteer to Thurii when it was being colonized by Athens, and there he died and was buried in the marketplace. But some authorities state that he died in Pella...<2> The Souda is not perfect as a biography, however. It is known that Herodotus did not learn the Ionic dialect while in Samos. By Herodotus' day Ionic was the native tongue of the Dorian founded Halikarnassos. There is also speculation that the family may have had partially non-Greek origins not mentioned in the biography, since the father's name and that of another male relative, Panyassis, is Carian, not Hellenic.<3> Also, in the History, Herodotus treats the Carians with \"a sympathy that he withholds from the Ionian cities that were Halikarnassos's neighbors.\"<4> This mixed heritage and Halikarnassos' position on the edge of the Hellenic world would have given Herodotus the historian a unique viewpoint among Greeks. He was aware of the differences between the Greeks and the barbarians, but he does not treat the foreigners as inherently inferior. In fact, he sees them as equals to the Greeks in many ways, highlighting their courage and strength.<5> Herodotus also lived under both the Persians and Athenians, and had the opportunity to compare and contrast both governments.<6> Many of the facets of Herodotus\" personality can be deduced from the events of his early childhood. His History makes it clear that he was curious about everything, and that while well read, Herodotus preferred to learn first hand. He wanted to see foreign lands for himself, talk to the people who lived there, hear their stories, and draw his own conclusions.<7> To this end, Herodotus traveled the length and breadth of the known world, intending to visit as many countries as he could and meet as many people as possible. It is believed that Herodotus first traveled to the north, which makes sense given his inquisitive nature. To the south lay Egypt, a country well known to the Greeks, and one with whom there were \"long and ancient ties.\"<8> All countries to the east of Greece were still under Persian control at this time, and to the west, Greeks had explored and founded colonies all the way to Massilia (Marseille). The North, however, was a vast, unexplored mystery. There were scattered Greek settlements on the coasts of the Black Sea, but beyond them, the wilderness of Thrace and Scythia beckoned. Herodotus sailed north from Samos, following the coast of Asia minor and to the Hellespont. After sailing to various spots in the Sea of Mamara, he then traveled through the Bosphorus, visiting the city of Byzantium, barely a hundred years old at this time, and Chalcedon.<9> Byzantium was already a city eight miles in circumference by the time Herodotus visited it, and it had been liberated from the Persians only thirteen years before. The time spent in this area must have been very exciting to Herodotus. He saw the straights of the Hellespont where Xerxes constructed his bridge of boats for the invasion of Europe, the spot where Darius made his crossing of the Bosphorus on his way to Marathon, and various other sights rich in legend and tradition.<10> The coastal areas of the Black Sea had been subdued by the Persians in the sense that they once controlled the coastal cities and could move through the interior with large armies, but the lands in modern day Bulgaria and Romania \"were hardly a place through which an unescorted stranger could travel.\"<11> Herodotus, however, still had the persistent recklessness of his youth, and on one or two occasions, probably with experienced guides (if not armed guards) penetrated the interior to see the tribes that lived beyond the Greek frontier. Herodotus viewed the Thracians as a warlike, somewhat inferior people, much like Americans were viewed by their British counterparts during the colonial period. He saw the peculiar, un-Greek, traits and customs, but failed to see the complex social system and tradition which had given rise to them. He traveled their lands northward all the way to the Danube river, and learned from the peoples along the river about the lands and peoples farther upstream, namely the Celts and the Cynetes.<12> After he had seen as much of the region as he could, Herodotus set out once again, this time for the primary objective of his expedition, the city of Olbia, on an inlet where the Bug and Dnieper Rivers meet. Olbia was the most important Greek city on the Black sea, and for Herodotus it was the natural center from which he could learn about the Scythians and the lands they inhabit.<13> While in Olbia, Herodotus traveled with various Greek trading vessels, heading up the Dnieper into the region of Kiev. Despite all his travels, Herodotus was no pioneer. He only went where the Greek merchants already could and did go.<14> Because of this, the accounts of his travels in the region are sparse relating mainly to comments on the climate, which was bitterly cold, and the customs and traditions of the people near the shores where the Greeks stopped to ply their trade. From these limited sources, however, Herodotus was able to infer with incredible accuracy the origins of the Scythians. Herodotus was correctly able to identify the Scythians as an Indo-European people (though he did not use that term) who migrated from central Russia in the 8th and 7th centuries BC. Later studies have shown that he was also able to correctly deduce the circumstances of their emigration into Scythia<15> and discount several of the local legends surrounding their origins.<16> Risking a violent and gruesome death,<17> Herodotus continued his voyages around the Black Sea, learning about the peoples in the area. He also noted that the farther away a people was reported to live, the odder the people became. For instance, he is told of a people beyond the Scythians who people who supposedly wore black cloaks and ate lice. Beyond them dwelled a race of bald headed men, and beyond them still were a race of men with goats feet, and finally a race of men who slept six months out of the year. Of course Herodotus refused to believe much of what he was told. The people of Neuri, he was told, became wolves once a year. Herodotus immediately discounts the story, a scepticism far in advance of his age, when one takes into account the fact that 15th century theologians ruled that not only were there werewolves, but that they were the work of the devil and to be abhorred.<18> Despite the obvious legends and myths that Herodotus discovered while in Scythia, he also explored truly historic sites. The forts which Darius constructed to secure his advance into Greece were still in existence when Herodotus visited them. Similarly, correspondence between the Scythian kings and the Persian emperors was still in the collective memory of the peoples there and had great significance on the History Herodotus was to write. It is believed that Herodotus made one more stop on his voyages around the Black Sea. Herodotus directly states that he went to Colchis, and at no other time would he have had a better opportunity to visit the site where Jason and the Argonauts retrieved the Golden Fleece.<19> Herodotus was more interested in events relating to his own age, however, and went to Colchis because they were a tribute paying member of the Persian Empire and to investigate rumors that the people of Colchis were of Egyptian descent. His description of encounters there, however, are considered among the most untrustworthy of all the accounts in his History. The conclusions he reaches regarding the origins of the Colchis, while plausible, are hardly incontrovertible, and if not for his own direct statement, there would be little reason to believe he had ever set foot in the country. From Colchis, it is believed that Herodotus traveled home, first traveling through Panticapaeum and Olibia and then back through the Bosphorus. From the 18th century onward, archeological expeditions in southern Russia have verified and expanded the knowledge of the Scythians first passed along by Herodotus.<20> While some of the details of Herodotus' accounts of his travels among the Scythians have been proven false, the vast majority have been proven correct, leading scholars in recent days to take the other accounts of Herodotus, \"father of lies,\"<21> a little more seriously. Upon returning from his trip to Scythia, Herodotus took part in the liberation of his Halikarnassos, and succeeded in removing the tyrant Lygdamis from power. Herodotus, though a member of a leading Halikarnassian family, had no desire to shoulder the responsibilities of state,<22> and his inquisitiveness and wanderlust took hold of him once again. It should be noted, however, that some scholars feel that it was Herodotus' unpopularity due to his Athenian ties, and not his restlessness that caused him to leave.<23> In any event, Sometime between 454 and 449 BC, Herodotus set out again, this time for Babylon.<24> The first stop on Herodotus' voyage was the city of Myriandrus, a Phoenician colony on the coast of Syria, a few miles south of the modern day city of Iskenderun. From there he traveled about 100 miles eastward to the shores of the Euphrates river, which he intended to follow downstream to Babylon. Herodotus stopped at several cities along the river, inquiring as to their history and cultures, and again has been proven accurate in his renditions of their tales.<25> Herodotus continued his voyage down the Euphrates to the city of Babylon. While in the city he inquired as to its capture by the Persian Cyrus, and the brief revolt which Darius put down in 521. By the time Xerxes came to power revolts in Babylon had become almost continuous, and Xerxes demolished much of the fortifications and destroyed large portions of the city.<26> Thirty years later, when Herodotus visited the city, the damage had been all but erased. He describes the city as being fifty-six miles in circumference and surpassing in splendor any known city in the world.<27> Herodotus also notes the architectural wonders of the city as well as the dress, beliefs, and customs of the people living there. At some time before 449 BC, Herodotus left the city and returned home. It was not long after that-- 446 at the latest-- that Herodotus set out on his third great expedition, this time to Egypt. While in the northern, delta region of the country, Herodotus spent his time with the Egyptian priests, who told the Greek of their history, culture, and science. He was intrigued with the differences between Greek and Egyptian priests,<28> the differences in climates and cultures and with the deep and rich history of the region. The Nile itself proved especially interesting for Herodotus, because its regular flooding of the fields was unknown in Greece.<29> The river behaved as no other river the Greek historian had ever seen. During the summer months, rivers in Greece shallowed and dried up, but in Egypt, the opposite would occur. Herodotus continued to travel upstream, probably in search of the source of the Nile, a subject that he apparently was very interested in and one in which he could find little information. Herodotus dismisses many of the ancient theories on the origins of the Nile, and while he is correct in the refutation of these theories, the solutions he presents for the behavior of the Nile are equally false.<30> It is relatively easy to tell which places in Egypt Herodotus visited, but the order in which he visited them and the routes he took to get there are difficult to determine.<31> It is known that Herodotus visited Naucratis, and that from there he either went to Sais and Buto, or traveled by sea to Buto and then to Sais, which is far more likely.<32> Then he traveled onward to a place he calls \"Papremis,\" which may have been either Xois or Chois, a city on an island in the Sebennytic branch of the Nile.<33> While there he saw the skulls of the Persians who had been killed by the Libyan king who rose against Darius and investigated the links between the Egyptian kings and the ill-fated Athenian expedition of 460 BC. From there, Herodotus journeyed on to Busiris, where he observed and recorded some of the practices of the cults of Osiris and Isis. He traveled cross-country to Bubastis, on the eastern bank of the Pelusian branch of the Nile.<34> Though little remains of Bubastis today, Herodotus apparently had fond memories of its tree-lined streets and large temples. From there it is believed that Herodotus traveled to Heliopolis, whose inhabitants, Herodotus believed, were the most learned in Egypt. It is presumed that the priests in Heliopolis related the details of their religion and culture to Herodotus, but for once he Greek historian is tight-lipped about what he had learned.<35> Leaving Heliopolis, Herodotus wandered south, until he reached the narrows where the Nile is hemmed in by the Arabian mountains. Here, near the quarries which were the source of the stone used for the pyramids was the city of Memphis. Like any tourist of Egypt, Herodotus visited the pyramids, and described the three great pyramids in detail. It is interesting to note, however, that while he must have seen it, Herodotus makes no mention of the Sphinx. Herodotus continued south from Memphis into Thebes, the chief city of Upper Egypt, and believed to be one of the oldest in the world.<36> The city left him a little flat, however, and for some unknown reason Herodotus has little to say about it. Some have taken this as a sign that this part of the History is a fabrication, but as anyone who has found the Grand Canyon dull or thought the Eiffel Tower was just a building knows, sometimes a visitor just is not impressed by the impressive. It is a sign of Herodotus' honesty that when he has nothing to say, he says nothing about it.<37> This malaise drove him onward from Thebes toward the destination he had sought from the start of his journey into Egypt, the city of Elephantine. Elephantine was a Persian frontier post and marked the southern boundary of the Persian Empire, and Herodotus has no intention of traveling into the country beyond. Instead he relies on hearsay to gather information about the kingdom of Ethiopia, which lies to the south.<38> Aside from the information he was able to gather in Elephantine, Herodotus also had the first hand accounts of Ethiopians who had served in Xerxes' army during its invasion of Greece to tell him about the lands which lay beyond him.<39> Having reached his ultimate destination at Elephantine, Herodotus returned north to see a few more sites in lower Egypt. He was apparently not in much of a hurry to return to Halikarnassos, either because traveling had become habitual or because he knew that he would not like it when he got there. Still he probably did feel a longing for home, and if home was not Halikarnassos, it was at least Greece. From some port in eastern Egypt, Herodotus set out by boat for Cyrene, a Greek colony five hundred miles to the west.<40> There he continued his investigations into the local peoples, and inquired about the inhabitants of Northern Africa as far as the pillars of Hercules and beyond, though there is little substance to the stories he is told.<41> From there he sailed on to Tyre, where he apparently still had some questions which needed answering, and left Africa behind him.<42> His purpose in Tyre was to check on the accuracy of what he had been told in Egypt about the origins of Egyptian and Greek religion. These stories were verified at an ancient temple to Heracles in Tyre, where the Egyptians believed the history of their gods went back seventeen thousand years.<43> With this last bit of business concluded, Herodotus finally set sail for home. Herodotus knew that Halikarnassos was not the place for him, however, and within two years he had left once again, this time for Athens. The city had been sacked and burned by Xerxes in 480, but that had been more than thirty years ago. The atmosphere in Athens, however, was little more comforting to Herodotus than the one he left in Halikarnassos. A law passed by Pericles in 451 ended all hopes Herodotus might have had of becoming an Athenian citizen, and instead of remaining as a resident foreigner, Herodotus began to reconsider his options.<44> Having been as far north, south, and east as any Greek, Herodotus decided to set off once again, this time as a \"not-so-reluctant colonist to Italy.\"<45> Evidence in Aristotle's Rhetoric tells us that Herodotus emigrated to Thurioi, an Athenian colony in southern Italy,<46> sometime after 444,<47> where it is believed that he completed his history. Herodotus did not remain in Thuria, however. He probably returned to Athens sometime around 430. On at least three occasions Herodotus refers to incidents in the opening phases of the Peloponnesian War that tie up loose ends from earlier in the History.<48> These events, however, would have been too minor for someone living in southern Italy to have known about.<49> The city at this time was at the highest point of glory, and yet at the pinnacle of disaster, as it moved closer to war with Sparta. It is believed that he stayed in the city from 431-430, but the city was probably starting to loose its luster to the aging historian. Herodotus had already written about one war, he had little desire to write about another. It is unclear just how long Herodotus stayed in Athens, but a few facts can be inferred from his influence on others. When Aristophanes published his Archarnians in 425, there are clear allusions to Herodotus' work,<50> but unlike Aristophanes' treatment of Socrates, Euripides, and others, there are no physical parodies of the Historian. Some scholars take this to indicate that Herodotus was no longer in Athens by 425, as Aristophanes tends to reserve satire for what is prominent and present--\"obscurity earned no laughs.\"<51> It is most probable that Herodotus returned to Thuria after his stay in Athens, possibly to flee the plague which had broken out there, possibly because there was nothing else for him there. In any event, his days of traveling were behind him and, assuming he left Athens alive, Herodotus settled down to a life of relaxation and editing of his work. His voyages to the four corners of the world brought Herodotus into contact with more peoples than any other Greek of his day, and he used what he learned in his research to tell the story of the war that shaped his youth. It is ironic that with all of Herodotus efforts to preserve the memories of the events of others, the circumstances, even the location and date, of his own death have been forgotten. While anyone could have related the tales of the Persian war, it is the details and tidbits garnered while traveling that separate Herodotus' tale and have made it stand out for over two thousand years. The Well Clearly, Herodotus was a well read and well traveled man, but no one could create such a work out of nothing. What was the well from which this wealth of knowledge was drawn? What sources did Herodotus use to create such a diverse and colorful History? What Herodotus learned from the people with whom he spoke to while on his travels he undoubtedly called upon while constructing his work, but he also drew on the collective learning of all those who had gone before him. The fifth century BC marked the beginning of a period when records and genealogies were being \"ferreted out,\"<52> and while he was at the vanguard of that movement, it is clear that Herodotus did not move alone. About 400 years after Herodotus, another historian from Halikarnassos, Dionysius, briefly described the beginnings of Greek historical research by saying: \"Before the Peloponnesian War there were many early historians in many places. . . . A second group was born a little before the Peloponnesian War and were Thucydides' early contemporaries. . . .\" Herodotus, however, enlarged the historian’s scope. \"He chose not to write down the history of a single city or nation, but to put together many, varied events of Europe and Asia in a single comprehensive work.\"<53> This passage seems to indicate that contemporary to Herodotus there existed local historians, all crafting personal histories for one reason or another.<54> If this passage is taken at face value, it is possible that Herodotus did not have to rely solely on the data provided by his own travels to construct his History. Herodotus himself mentions the work of Hecataeus of Miletus,<55> who wrote two books of historical geography and was a major source in Herodotus' writings on Egypt. Unfortunately, not enough of Hecataeus' work has survived for us to judge just how dependent upon it Herodotus was. There are several direct quotes from the geographer's work,<56> but only once outside of Egypt does Herodotus quote Hecataeus.<57> While we can show that Herodotus had a familiarity with Hecataeus, there are several other sources which Herodotus was probably familiar with but which we cannot identify. Charon of Lampsacus, Xanthus of Lydia, and Dionysius of Miletus all wrote histories of their respective areas that Herodotus could have drawn on, but his dependence on them is unclear. What is clear is that Herodotus regarded himself as an independent researcher, and that his work on the Persian War was an original achievement.<58> Like any good historian, Herodotus includes as much primary material as he could glean from the people he talked to in his work. Herodotus does not fully trust his sources, however. He takes special care to let his readers know when he is relating what he was told by other people, and often includes accounts that he believes to be false simply because that is what he was told. As Herodotus himself says, \"Throughout the entire history it is my underlying principle that it is what people severally have said to me, and what I have heard that I must write down.\"<59> Herodotus lived in a time when oral traditions were still preserved with care, and he probably gained most of his information this way.<60> Most scholars believe that even without extraordinary means, oral traditions, cultures, and memories can remain fresh for three generations. The Persian Wars were still within the three-generation span when Herodotus did his research, and Herodotus undoubtedly spoke to living witnesses of the great invasion.<61> By the 5th century, Greek culture was beginning to organize itself with historical learning in mind. Temples and Oracles were beginning to collate their records and temple archives were beginning to gain some acclaim. There are records that show by 403 BC Athens had organized a central archive in the Metroon, the temple of the Mother of the Gods, and some sources claim that the records there went back as far as the sixth century.<62> Though we have little evidence, it is probable that other temples outside of Athens kept records not just of temple matters but secular ones as well. These document collections, however, would prove little help to Herodotus.<63> The documentary evidence that is so valued among modern day historians was simply of no use to Herodotus. In the first place, the temple archives that housed what little documentary evidence there was did not simply open their doors to every wanderer who happened by.<64> Unless a document was published--which means it was inscribed and set in a public place--the average person would not have had access to it, let alone been able to read it. Herodotus cites twenty-four inscriptions, half of them Greek, half not.<65> Some of these he wrote down, some he recalled from memory,<66> but for the most part Herodotus does not value documentary evidence very highly-- the reason was not that it was unavailable, but that it was inaccessible.<67> Herodotus has been called the father of History, and indeed he attempts to earn that title. He follows the same patterns of research and inquiry that have been par for historical investigations for the centuries that followed. Herodotus interviewed witnesses, both first and second hand, looked into documentary evidence, even traveled the same paths his History would go, all in an attempt to preserve the events of men, and, as if seeking von Ranke's approval, to tell his story as it actually happened. To Tell a Tale Every historian, even the first, consciously and unconsciously shapes his narrative and judgements so as to convey a perception of his subject in a persuasive manner.<68> The historian, by his delivery and style has the power to distance the reader from the subject at hand, or by a simple twist of phrasing invite them into the drama he creates. Herodotus has an agenda that he tries to bring forth in his narrative. There are certain incidents and episodes that the historian wants to accent, and in doing so shapes his History to fit his idea of what is needed. An ideal flow of events would be one in which one page describes one event, in an endless flow of history which begins at the beginning and ends at the ending. This however is a dream which no realistic historian even attempts to attain, and Herodotus is no exception. Herodotus interrupts the rhythmic progress of his history with privileged scenes-- special incidents special only because Herodotus chose them-- designed to develop themes that may not become apparent until hundreds of pages later.<69> He inflates the incidents that he tells with dramatic detail, while at the same time deflating, or even ignoring, other episodes-- sometimes days, weeks, or even centuries go unrecorded all for the sake of dramatic telling.<70> An example of this can be seen in the seventh book of the History. Herodotus wanted his audience to see the wonders that Xerxes accomplished in crossing his army over the Hellespont on the ill-fated invasion of Greece.<71> To place us there, Herodotus tells the story from the point of view of a local Hellespontine who watches and relates the story in awe. Whether this person was actually there or not, or even if he every spoke of such an event to Herodotus is not really the point. The story is painstakingly told as if it were happening at that time, and the eye-witness narrator draws the reader in so that he or she is no longer looking into a window to the past, but instead is a participant in it.<72> Despite the literate culture in which he lived and work, there are still numerous elements in the History which harken back to the epic days of old. One of the key characteristics of epic poetry is the use of extensive catalogues, best exemplified by the listing of ships in Book II of the Illiad. This catalogue is paralleled by Herodotus' listing of the invasion force of Xerxes and to a lesser extent the lists of Ionian cities, Greek fleets, and so on.<73> Genealogy, also a key component in the Homeric narrative, plays an important role for Herodotus. Of course this may be for more practical concerns that a simple reverence for the epic poet. In cultures which preserve their history orally, genealogies and king-lists provide the best and in some cases only means of dating a past event. It may be known that something occurred in the fifth year of King X, but exactly how many years ago that was is unclear. By estimating the number of years between generations, however, it is possible to count backwards and estimate approximately how long ago an event occurred. Herodotus will also interrupt a speech or other dramatic moment to make sure his audience has followed the story correctly up to that point. In book five, for instance he interrupts Aristagoras' speech by inserting, \"While speaking, he was pointing to the map of the earth that he carried around engraved on his tablet.\"<74> This hardly seems relevant, especially since Herodotus had described the map earlier in that very same paragraph. For a literate man, reading the History, there would be no need to repeat the description of the map-- he could easily back up a few lines and re-read the description if it pleased him. This repeating of the description is a throwback to the days of oral tradition and oral epic poetry, where elements are repeated because \"in lengthy recitals of epic poetry with attendant fuss and movement in the crowd, there must have naturally have been some loss of comprehension. . . .\"<75> Herodotus draws the reader into his work through the use of other old-time epic devices. In the text of his work, the words and forms he uses also serve the same purpose. He consistently uses the second person singular in his work, almost as though he were talking to the reader personally. For instance, when discussing his (erroneous) belief that all Persian names end in \"-s\" he writes, \"On searching this out, you will find no exceptions to this among their names.\"<76> This also allows Herodotus to permit his readers to hold different beliefs, by showing the existence of different points of view (I believe this, while you can believe that), a \"form of presentation rarely found in other historians.\"<77> Herodotus' use of digression is also a leftover device from Homeric times.<78> At first glance, the numerous digressions in Herodotus' narrative seem like haphazard placements of material, sometimes relevant, oftentimes not. This view, however, comes from a modern interpretation of the style of historical writing.<79> The modern historian also arranges his narrative in a dramatic form, but he or she uses footnotes, endnotes and citations to show the inner workings-- the raw data-- of his or her work. These notes allow the historian to share sources of information, present tangential information, and provide basis of opinions. It allows the historian to \"keep the forest in view while examining particular trees.\"<80> Herodotus, however, was not able to use such conventions as footnotes or endnotes (or for that matter, pages, chapters, or books). Because of this, his digressions had to be placed more carefully, so that Herodotus could make his point without losing his audience.<81> One of the largest problems that many historians have with Herodotus is his use of direct speeches in the later books of the History. It is clear that there is no way Herodotus or his sources could have obtained word for word transcripts of the speeches of local Greek leaders, much less Xerxes and the other Persian emperors. Therefore we must accept that these speeches were made up by Herodotus (or his \"sources\") for some greater purpose.<82> It is possible that the dramatic speech is also a throwback to the epic days of yore, but it far more likely that they serve a serious purpose.<83> Recent scholars have pointed out that in Greek history, the narrative is used to relate historical events, and the personal speeches are reserved to provide rational explanation for the events.<84> These dramatic speeches are used (and composed?) by Herodotus to reveal character, to explain a policy, and, most importantly, to keep the audience interested in the progress of the tale. One of the traits that separates Herodotus from the many historians both before and after him is the way in which he relates to his audience. He does not lecture them like a superior professor to inferior students, but relates to them like friends and equals. He uses humor, irony, and sarcasm in a way few since have succeeded, especially in the way he relates to the unbelievable or demonstrably false portions of his history. For instance, in the fourth book of the history, There is a lake in it from which the girls of that country draw up gold dust out of the mud with bird feathers smeared with pitch. I do not know if this is exactly true; I write down just what I am told. Still, anything may happen...<85> The irony is practically dripping off the page as it is read. These planned literary devices show the audience that Herodotus is not rambling uncontrollably as he relates his story, and while they are one step beyond the familiar figures of speech, they are not incapable of ferreting out historical truth and delivering it to the audience.<86> Indeed, it may be Herodotus' use of baser literary constructs which make his History so appealing to the people and so disliked by historians. Herodotus may have been at the forefront of the historical revolution in Greece, but he clearly was descendent from a long literary line. Herodotus makes the jump from the epic poems of Homer to secular history, but he does not forget the roots from which his genre came. It is possible that Herodotus employed the same structures and methods of the epic poet because of the similarities in their work. Herodotus was not a blind poet, but his did tell a tale. He was not honored as telling the stories of gods and men, but he still sought to make a living by entertaining others. Herodotus used tried and true methods of telling a great story, and incorporated them into his History when it was committed to paper. With every word that Herodotus composed, he sought to craft a history so that \"time may not draw the color from what man has brought into being. . .,\"<87> and to do this he did not use the stuffy, high-minded Greek rhetoric that the philosophers preferred, but instead the epic language of the greatest storyteller ever told. Conclusion -- To Influence the Ages While little is known about Herodotus' life or death, his influence in both his own time and the future is undeniable. Herodotus enjoyed limited fame in his own lifetime-- probably enough to support himself in his later years on the equivalent of the lecture circuit. Fortunately Herodotus was long dead before the true attacks on his character and work were penned, even though the first and perhaps deepest cut was made by Thucydides, a neophyte historian only some ten years his junior. In the years, decades, and centuries that followed in the aftermath of the History, Herodotus was seen as entertainer, plagiarizer, and even outright liar, but despite what those who followed him thought about him and his work, he was the first, the father of the new study of history. Herodotus was known in the Greek world while he was still alive, and his time in Athens did much to enhance his fame. Aristophanes satirizes him in his play Acharnians, something hardly justifiable if Herodotus was an unknown scholar. There are also theories that Sophocles borrowed from the stories of Herodotus in his composition of his Theben Trilogy, especially Antigone.<88> But it was not long, however, before Herodotus' fifteen minutes of fame were up and others in his field began to attack his work and the fame it brought the historian from Halikarnassos. Though Thucydides never mentions Herodotus by name, he voices his contempt for his predecessor in the opening of his own work: The absence of an element of romance in my account of what happened, may well make it less attractive to hear, but all who want to attain a clear point of view of the past, and also of like or nearly like events which, human nature being what is, will probably occur in the future-- if these people consider my work useful, I shall be content. It is written to be a possession of lasting value, not a work competing for an immediate hearing.<89> Thucydides seems to claim a seriousness which he feels his predecessor lacked, and the fact that Herodotus was followed by frauds such as Ctesias of Cnidus<90> while Thucydides was followed by serious historians such as Xenophon, Sallust, and Procopius, did little to help the father of History's reputation.<91> After Alexander the Great's conquests opened up the East, countries such as Egypt and Persia were suddenly much better known. Herodotus was indeed popular during the Hellenistic period, but he was popular because every two-bit intellectual went abroad with the intent of writing a pamphlet disproving some facet of the History.<92> The only one of these pamphlets that has survived with the text intact is Plutarch's On the Malignity of Herodotus. Plutarch's attacks, however, ring of the same right wing patriotism that can be seen in most xenophobic nation-states.<93> Herodotus praised things that went against the national character of the empire, and to make matters worse, \"he wrote so well that people read him.\"<94> The Renaissance took its views of Herodotus from the past, with the academic elite still holding him in disdain while the more common scholars enjoyed him as a great read. It is interesting to note that while there were forty-one versions of Thucydides' work in Europe between 1450 and 1700, forty-four versions of the inferior work of Herodotus have been found so far.<95> At some point during this period, Herodotus began to experience a resurgence in popularity. As though caught up in the rebirth of the Renaissance itself, Herodotus was again turned to as people once more turned to the orient as a place of wonder and excitement. The nineteenth century allowed modern day scholars to examine Herodotus in a new light. As archaeologists spread out over Egypt, Persia and the rest of the Middle East, they turned up evidence that made it clear that Herodotus' \"marvelous tales\" were not fiction.<96> By the twentieth century, Herodotus had gained a healthy respect as a reporter, and as more and more of his accounts were backed up with archaeological evidence he grew in reputation as a researcher.<97> The historian from Halikarnassos set out with a simple goal in mind. He wanted to preserve the events of men so that they would not fade from the tapestry of history. It is ironic that through the centuries, all that Herodotus sought to preserve was nearly lost simply because he sought to preserve it. Surviving attacks from contemporaries and would be critics, Herodotus ultimately succeeded in his goal-- He delivered his message to the present day, where modern science and history have been able to prove him correct. Herodotus-- Father of History and Father of Lies-- What will the future think of him? If success is judged by the completion of stated goals, then truly, Herodotus succeeded with his History. In any event, when one takes into consideration the struggles Herodotus and his marvelous tale endured both before and after his death, there can be no doubt that he has earned his place at the vanguard of history. Notes 1 J.A.S. Evans Herodotus. Boston, Twayne Publishers, 1982. 1. 34 Lister, 134. 35 Lister, 137. Herodotus does not want to give away what he perceives as secrets of Egyptian religion. Luckily we have other sources which were not so concerned with the sanctity of Egypt’s faith. 36 Lister, 147. 37 Lister, 148. 38 Lister, 149. 39 Lister, 150. 40 The evidence that Herodotus actually went to Cyrene is spotty, but it does lead scholars to tend to believe his account. 41 Lister, 158. 42 Lister, 159. 43 Lister, 159-60. The temple itself is believed to have been as old as the city of Tyre, which was already, according to Herodotus, 2300 years old when the Greek historian visited it. 44 Lister, 167. 45 Lister, 169. 46 Aristotle, Rhetoric, trans. W. Rhys Roberts. Web document http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/rhetoric.html. Book 3, Part 9. 47 This is the date of the foundation of Thurioi. 48 These incidents are: The expulsion of the Aiginetans from their island by Athens (vi.91), the sparing of Decelea by the invading Peloponnesians (ix.73), and the execution of the Spartan ambassadors Aneristus and Nicolaus (vii.137). 49 Hart, 165. 50 Aristophanes tells of a meeting between Athenian ambassadors and Persian officials that mirrors the accounts Herodotus gives of life at Persian court, including the foods served and the dining implements used. Also, the route and means of transport used by the Athenians is the same as that used by prominent figures in the History. 51 Hart, 174. 52 Evans, 145. 53 quoted in Evans, 142. 54 Evans, 142. 55 He does so in v.36 and v.125. 56 Hecataeus calls Egypt the \"Gift of the Nile\" and Herodotus approves of this description (ii.5) without citing the source of it. 57 Evans, 143. Hecataeus provides an alternate version of the expulsion of the Pelasgians from Attica (vi.137). 58 Evans, 145. 59 ii.123. 60 Evans, 153. 61 Evans, 153. 62 Evans, 152. 63 Evans, 152. 64 Evans, 152. 65 Evans, 152. 66 The inscription on the great pyramid at Gizeh (ii.125) is an example of an inscription quoted from memory. 67 Evans, 152. 68 Donald Lateiner.

If that were the case, then why voyage to the far ends of the world? It would be far easier to invent a character and have them relate the suspect information in a dramatic speech. (Some scholars-- those who call Herodotus the \"father of lies\" believe that this is exactly what he did.) 84 Waters, 67. 85 iv.195. 86 Herodotus undoubtedly knew that a lot of what he was told was impossible or outright wrong, and if he knew it, he knew his audience would know it too. Rather than deleting it from the History, however, he includes it with a sarcastic undertone that leaves no doubt about the author’s feelings about the source. 87 i.1 88 Evans, 13-17. The story of Antigone’s devotion to her brother is matched in Herodotus 3.119 by the story of Intaphrenes’ wife, who chose to have her brother freed by Darius rather than her husband. 89 Thucydides, History of the Peloponnesian War. (i.22) Quoted in Evans, 163. 90 Evans holds Ctesias with something less than contempt. He calls him a \"fraudulent romancer, who borrowed Herodotus’s style, used him as a source, and repaid him by blackening his reputation.\" (163). 91 Evans, 163. 92 Evans 164-5. 93 Plutarch takes Herodotus to task for his ambivalent feelings about Thebes, an accurate criticism, then calls him a barbarian lover and berates him for finding barbarian origins for things Plutarch considers Greek.

Federico Fellini, (born January 20, 1920, Rimini, Italy—died October 31, 1993, Rome), Italian film director who was one of the most celebrated and singular filmmakers of the period after World War II. Influenced early in his career by the Neorealist movement, he developed his own distinctive methods that superimposed dreamlike or hallucinatory imagery upon ordinary situations. He added vastly to the vocabulary of the cinema and pioneered a personal style of filmmaking now integral to its practice. The son of a traveling salesman who sold foodstuffs and a mother who believed that, in marrying beneath her, she betrayed her links to Roman nobility, Fellini grew up believing he belonged in Rome. In the late 1930s he moved there with his mother and brother. Only Federico stayed on, however, surviving by selling cartoons, gags, and stories to the humour magazine Marc’Aurelio. During World War II Fellini wrote scripts for the radio serial Cico e Pallina, starring Giulietta Masina, who became his wife in 1943 and who appeared in several of his films during an often troubled 50-year marriage. In 1944 Fellini met director Roberto Rossellini and became one of a team of writers for Roma, città aperta (1945; Open City or Rome, Open City), a pioneer film of Neorealism. Fellini’s contribution to the screenplay earned him his first Oscar nomination. Fellini quickly became one of Italy’s most successful screenwriters. He collaborated on screenplays for such directors as Pietro Germi (Il cammino della speranza [1950; The Path of Hope]), Alberto Lattuada (Senza pietà [1948; Without Pity]), and Luigi Comencini (Persiane chiuse [1951; Behind Closed Shutters]); he was uncredited on the latter film. In addition, Fellini contributed to Rossellini’s Paisà (1946; Paisan) and Il miracolo (1948; “The Miracle”, an episode of the film L’amore), in which he also acted, playing a tramp who impregnates a simple-minded peasant when she takes him for the reincarnation of St. Joseph. Fellini’s quest for a more personal style, which often verged on the fantastic, alienated Neorealist purists. His directorial debut, Luci del varietà (1950; Variety Lights), made in collaboration with Lattuada, is set in a traveling variety show. An enthusiast of the seedy side of show business, in particular vaudeville and the circus, Fellini returned to this milieu repeatedly, beginning with his first independent feature, Lo sceicco bianco (1952; The White Sheik), a satire on the fumetti (photographic comic strips) and their fanatical fans. However, his first critical and commercial success, I vitelloni (1953; Spivs or The Young and the Passionate), exhibited little fantasy. Based on his own adolescence in Rimini, it faithfully reflects the boredom of provincial life, which drove him to Rome. With La strada (1954; “The Road”), Fellini returned to the world of showmen. It starred Anthony Quinn as Zampanò, a brutish but phoney itinerant \"strong man,\" and Masina as the waif who loves him. The film was shot on desolate locations between Viterbo and Abruzzi, mean villages and flinty roads that were intended to reflect the moral aridity of Quinn’s character, throwing into relief the sweet, forgiving nature of Masina’s Gelsomina. A commercial success, La strada won an Academy Award for best foreign film, and Nino Rota’s plaintive theme song became a hit. Producers offered to feature Masina as Gelsomina in a sequel, but Fellini instead gave her a small role only in the cynical Il bidone (1955; “The Swindle”), which featured Broderick Crawford as the leader of a gang of con men who impersonate priests in order to rob the peasantry. Masina asserted her star quality in Le notti di Cabiria (1957; Nights of Cabiria), developing the minor character she played in Lo sceicco bianco, a good-natured Roman prostitute who is optimistic even when humiliated and is swindled by the man she expects to marry. One of Fellini’s most likeable films, it won an Oscar for best foreign film and inspired the 1966 Broadway musical comedy Sweet Charity and the 1969 movie of the same name. La dolce vita (1960; “The Sweet Life”) was the first of many collaborations with Marcello Mastroianni, an actor who came to represent Fellini’s alter ego. Inspired by newspaper headlines and some topical scandals, the film comprehensively indicts a Rome dominated by foreign movie stars, corrupt journalists, and decadent aristocrats. Condemned by the Roman Catholic Church but hailed by the public, La dolce vita contributed the word paparazzo (unscrupulous yellow-press photographer) to the English language and the adjective Felliniesque to the lexicon of film critics. He then made his first foray in colour, directing the segment Le tentazioni del dottor Antonio (“The Temptation of Dr. Antonio”) for the omnibus feature Boccaccio ’70 (1962). Otto e mezzo (1963; 8 1/2) is among Fellini’s most widely praised films and earned the director his third Oscar for best foreign film. Entitled 8 1/2 for the number of films Fellini had made by that time (seven features and two shorts), it shows a famous director (based on Fellini and portrayed by Mastroianni) in creative paralysis. Harried by argumentative screenwriters, importunate actresses, a terse unloving wife, and his brainless giggling girlfriend, he takes refuge in fantasies of childhood and the dream of a perfect, and therefore unattainable, woman, embodied in Claudia Cardinale. In 1965 Fellini’s health failed as he prepared what would have been his most personal work, The Journey of G. Mastorna, a dreamlike vision of the afterlife, starring Mastroianni. Forced to abandon the project, he fortuitously found an alternative outlet for his fantasies in colour. Technology placed in Fellini’s hands the tools to realize the visions that until then existed only in his dreams: “I close my eyes,” he wrote of his nocturnal imaginings, “and the festival starts.” His notebooks recording those dreams, lavishly illustrated, became his raw material. He embraced fantasy even more enthusiastically in Giulietta degli spiriti (1965: Juliet of the Spirits), with Masina as a simple bourgeois haunted by the supernatural. JulietNow established as an international talent, Fellini addressed the myths of Rome, employing an insight into the unconscious gained through study of his preferred psychoanalytical theorist, Carl Jung. Distributors incorporated Fellini’s name in the films’ titles, signifying the unique nature of his vision. Although technically inspired by Roman writers Gaius Petronius Arbiter and Lucius Apuleius, Fellini Satyricon (1969), promoted with the slogan “Before Christ. After Fellini,” actually celebrated the hippie movement, which he first encountered in the United States. Two aimless young bisexual men wander a morally and physically decaying world of casual decadence, rendered in the gaudy colours that until then had never been associated with antiquity. White marble gave way to crumbling stucco, bawdy graffiti, and urban filth. Sexually ambivalent in his private life, Fellini revealed in Satyricon a preoccupation with obesity, mutilation, and hermaphroditism that many found disturbing. Disappointingly, he never realized his hope of casting both Groucho Marx and Mae West in the film. In Roma (1972; Fellini’s Roma), the director applied the tools of fantasy to the national capital, alternating episodes of the modern hippie occupation of its monuments with his teenage visits to its brothels and the excavations that uncover what remains of the ancient city. An “ecclesiastical fashion show” controversially mocks the Vatican that consistently condemned his films. For Amarcord (1973), which won Fellini a fourth Oscar for best foreign film, he re-created wartime Rimini in Rome’s Cinecittà studios for a nostalgic remembrance of adolescence under fascism, which restored the eccentricity of his early life that had been omitted from I Vitelloni. Though audiences took the film to be autobiographical, most of its incidents came from the more flamboyant life of a childhood friend.

Influenced early in his career by the Neorealist movement, he developed his own distinctive methods that superimposed dreamlike or hallucinatory imagery upon ordinary situations. He added vastly to the vocabulary of the cinema and pioneered a personal style of filmmaking now integral to its practice. Early life and influences The son of a traveling salesman who sold foodstuffs and a mother who believed that, in marrying beneath her, she betrayed her links to Roman nobility, Fellini grew up believing he belonged in Rome. In the late 1930s he moved there with his mother and brother. Only Federico stayed on, however, surviving by selling cartoons, gags, and stories to the humour magazine Marc’Aurelio. During World War II Fellini wrote scripts for the radio serial Cico e Pallina, starring Giulietta Masina, who became his wife in 1943 and who appeared in several of his films during an often troubled 50-year marriage. In 1944 Fellini met director Roberto Rossellini and became one of a team of writers for Roma, città aperta (1945; Open City or Rome, Open City), a pioneer film of Neorealism. Fellini’s contribution to the screenplay earned him his first Oscar nomination. Fellini quickly became one of Italy’s most successful screenwriters.

My family is from Dhaka - now the capital of Bangladesh. My ancestral home in Wari in \"old Dhaka\" is not far from the University campus in Ramna. My father Ashutosh Sen taught chemistry at Dhaka University. I was, however, born in Santiniketan, on the campus of Rabindranath Tagore's Visva-Bharati (both a school and a college), where my maternal grandfather (Kshiti Mohan Sen) used to teach Sanskrit as well as ancient and medieval Indian culture, and where my mother (Amita Sen), like me later, had been a student. After Santiniketan, I studied at Presidency College in Calcutta and then at Trinity College in Cambridge, and I have taught at universities in both these cities, and also at Delhi University, the London School of Economics, Oxford University, and Harvard University, and on a visiting basis, at M.I.T., Stanford, Berkeley, and Cornell. I have not had any serious non-academic job. My planned field of study varied a good deal in my younger years, and between the ages of three and seventeen, I seriously flirted, in turn, with Sanskrit, mathematics, and physics, before settling for the eccentric charms of economics. But the idea that I should be a teacher and a researcher of some sort did not vary over the years. I am used to thinking of the word \"academic\" as meaning \"sound,\" rather than the more old-fashioned dictionary meaning: \"unpractical,\" \"theoretical,\" or \"conjectural.\" During three childhood years (between the ages of 3 and 6) I was in Mandalay in Burma, where my father was a visiting professor. But much of my childhood was, in fact, spent in Dhaka, and I began my formal education there, at St. Gregory's School. However, I soon moved to Santiniketan, and it was mainly in Tagore's school that my educational attitudes were formed. This was a co-educational school, with many progressive features. The emphasis was on fostering curiosity rather than competitive excellence, and any kind of interest in examination performance and grades was severely discouraged. (\"She is quite a serious thinker,\" I remember one of my teachers telling me about a fellow student, \"even though her grades are very good.\") Since I was, I have to confess, a reasonably good student, I had to do my best to efface that stigma. The curriculum of the school did not neglect India's cultural, analytical and scientific heritage, but was very involved also with the rest of the world. Indeed, it was astonishingly open to influences from all over the world, including the West, but also other non-Western cultures, such as East and South-East Asia (including China, Japan, Indonesia, Korea), West Asia, and Africa. I remember being quite struck by Rabindranath Tagore's approach to cultural diversity in the world (well reflected in our curriculum), which he had expressed in a letter to a friend: \"Whatever we understand and enjoy in human products instantly becomes ours, wherever they might have their origin... Let me feel with unalloyed gladness that all the great glories of man are mine.\" Identity and violence I loved that breadth, and also the fact that in interpreting Indian civilization itself, its cultural diversity was much emphasized. By pointing to the extensive heterogeneity in India's cultural background and richly diverse history, Tagore argued that the \"idea of India\" itself militated against a culturally separatist view, \"against the intense consciousness of the separateness of one's own people from others.\" Tagore and his school constantly resisted the narrowly communal identities of Hindus or Muslims or others, and he was, I suppose, fortunate that he died - in 1941 - just before the communal killings fomented by sectarian politics engulfed India through much of the 1940s. Some of my own disturbing memories as I was entering my teenage years in India in the mid-1940s relate to the massive identity shift that followed divisive politics. People's identities as Indians, as Asians, or as members of the human race, seemed to give way - quite suddenly - to sectarian identification with Hindu, Muslim, or Sikh communities. The broadly Indian of January was rapidly and unquestioningly transformed into the narrowly Hindu or finely Muslim of March. The carnage that followed had much to do with unreasoned herd behaviour by which people, as it were, \"discovered\" their new divisive and belligerent identities, and failed to take note of the diversity that makes Indian culture so powerfully mixed. The same people were suddenly different. I had to observe, as a young child, some of that mindless violence. One afternoon in Dhaka, a man came through the gate screaming pitifully and bleeding profusely. The wounded person, who had been knifed on the back, was a Muslim daily labourer, called Kader Mia. He had come for some work in a neighbouring house - for a tiny reward - and had been knifed on the street by some communal thugs in our largely Hindu area. As he was being taken to the hospital by my father, he went on saying that his wife had told him not to go into a hostile area during the communal riots. But he had to go out in search of work and earning because his family had nothing to eat. The penalty of that economic unfreedom turned out to be death, which occurred later on in the hospital. The experience was devastating for me, and suddenly made me aware of the dangers of narrowly defined identities, and also of the divisiveness that can lie buried in communitarian politics. It also alerted me to the remarkable fact that economic unfreedom, in the form of extreme poverty, can make a person a helpless prey in the violation of other kinds of freedom: Kader Mia need not have come to a hostile area in search of income in those troubled times if his family could have managed without it. Calcutta and its debates By the time I arrived in Calcutta to study at Presidency College, I had a fairly formed attitude on cultural identity (including an understanding of its inescapable plurality as well as the need for unobstructed absorption rather than sectarian denial). I still had to confront the competing loyalties of rival political attitudes: for example, possible conflicts between substantive equity, on the one hand, and universal tolerance, on the other, which simultaneously appealed to me. On this more presently. The educational excellence of Presidency College was captivating. My interest in economics was amply rewarded by quite outstanding teaching. I was particularly influenced by the teaching of Bhabatosh Datta and Tapas Majumdar, but there were other great teachers as well, such as Dhiresh Bhattacharya. I also had the great fortune of having wonderful classmates, particularly the remarkable Sukhamoy Chakravarty (more on him presently), but also many others, including Mrinal Datta Chaudhuri (who was also at Santiniketan, earlier) and Jati Sengupta. I was close also to several students of history, such as Barun De, Partha Gupta and Benoy Chaudhuri. (Presidency College had a great school of history as well, led by a most inspiring teacher in the form of Sushobhan Sarkar.) My intellectual horizon was radically broadened. The student community of Presidency College was also politically most active. Though I could not develop enough enthusiasm to join any political party, the quality of sympathy and egalitarian commitment of the \"left\" appealed to me greatly (as it did to most of my fellow students as well, in that oddly elitist college). The kind of rudimentary thinking that had got me involved, while at Santiniketan, in running evening schools (for illiterate rural children in the neighbouring villages) seemed now to be badly in need of systematic political broadening and social enlargement. I was at Presidency College during 1951 to 1953. The memory of the Bengal famine of 1943, in which between two and three million people had died, and which I had watched from Santiniketan, was still quite fresh in my mind. I had been struck by its thoroughly class-dependent character. (I knew of no one in my school or among my friends and relations whose family had experienced the slightest problem during the entire famine; it was not a famine that afflicted even the lower middle classes - only people much further down the economic ladder, such as landless rural labourers.) Calcutta itself, despite its immensely rich intellectual and cultural life, provided many constant reminders of the proximity of unbearable economic misery, and not even an elite college could ignore its continuous and close presence. And yet, despite the high moral and ethical quality of social commiseration, political dedication and a deep commitment to equity, there was something rather disturbing about standard leftwing politics of that time: in particular, its scepticism of process-oriented political thinking, including democratic procedures that permit pluralism. The major institutions of democracy got no more credit than what could be portioned out to what was seen as \"bourgeois democracy,\" on the deficiencies of which the critics were most vocal. The power of money in many democratic practices was rightly identified, but the alternatives - including the terrible abuses of non-oppositional politics - did not receive serious critical scrutiny. There was also a tendency to see political tolerance as a kind of \"weakness of will\" that may deflect well-meaning leaders from promoting \"the social good,\" without let or hindrance. Given my political conviction on the constructive role of opposition and my commitment to general tolerance and pluralism, there was a bit of a dilemma to be faced in coordinating those beliefs with the form of left-wing activism that characterized the mainstream of student politics in the-then Calcutta. What was at stake, it seemed to me, in political toleration was not just the liberal political arguments that had so clearly emerged in post-Enlightenment Europe and America, but also the traditional values of tolerance of plurality which had been championed over the centuries in many different cultures - not least in India. Indeed, as Ashoka had put it in the third century B.C.: \"For he who does reverence to his own sect while disparaging the sects of others wholly from attachment to his own, with intent to enhance the splendour of his own sect, in reality by such conduct inflicts the severest injury on his own sect.\" To see political tolerance merely as a \"Western liberal\" inclination seemed to me to be a serious mistake. Even though these issues were quite disturbing, they also forced me to face some foundational disputes then and there, which I might have otherwise neglected. Indeed, we were constantly debating these competing political demands. As a matter of fact, as I look back at the fields of academic work in which I have felt most involved throughout my life (and which were specifically cited by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in making their award), they were already among the concerns that were agitating me most in my undergraduate days in Calcutta. These encompassed welfare economics, economic inequality and poverty, on the one hand (including the most extreme manifestation of poverty in the form of famines), and the scope and possibility of rational, tolerant and democratic social choice, on the other (including voting procedures and the protection of liberty and minority rights). My involvement with the fields of research identified in the Nobel statement had, in fact, developed much before I managed to do any formal work in these areas. It was not long after Kenneth Arrow's path-breaking study of social choice, Social Choice and Individual Values, was published in New York in 1951, that my brilliant co-student Sukhamoy Chakravarty drew my attention to the book and to Arrow's stunning \"impossibility theorem\" (this must have been in the early months of 1952). Sukhamoy too was broadly attracted by the left, but also worried about political authoritarianism, and we discussed the implications of Arrow's demonstration that no non-dictatorial social choice mechanism may yield consistent social decisions. Did it really give any excuse for authoritarianism (of the left, or of the right)? I particularly remember one long afternoon in the College Street Coffee House, with Sukhamoy explaining his own reading of the ramifications of the formal results, sitting next to a window, with his deeply intelligent face glowing in the mild winter sun of Calcutta (a haunting memory that would invade me again and again when he died suddenly of a heart attack a few years ago). Cambridge as a battleground In 1953, I moved from Calcutta to Cambridge, to study at Trinity College. Though I had already obtained a B.A. from Calcutta University (with economics major and mathematics minor), Cambridge enroled me for another B.A. (in pure economics) to be quickly done in two years (this was fair enough since I was still in my late teens when I arrived at Cambridge). The style of economics at the-then Cambridge was much less mathematical than in Calcutta. Also, it was generally less concerned with some of the foundational issues that had agitated me earlier. I had, however, some wonderful fellow students (including Samuel Brittan, Mahbub ul Haq, Rehman Sobhan, Michael Nicholson, Lal Jayawardena, Luigi Pasinetti, Pierangelo Garegnani, Charles Feinstein, among others) who were quite involved with foundational assessment of the ends and means of economics as a discipline. However, the major debates in political economy in Cambridge were rather firmly geared to the pros and cons of Keynesian economics and the diverse contributions of Keynes's followers at Cambridge (Richard Kahn, Nicholas Kaldor, Joan Robinson, among them), on the one hand, and of \"neo-classical\" economists sceptical of Keynes, on the other (including, in different ways, Dennis Robertson, Harry Johnson, Peter Bauer, Michael Farrell, among others). I was lucky to have close relations with economists on both sides of the divide. The debates centred on macroeconomics dealing with economic aggregates for the economy as a whole, but later moved to capital theory, with the neo-Keynesians dead set against any use of \"aggregate capital\" in economic modelling (some of my fellow students, including Pasinetti and Garegnani, made substantial contributions to this debate). Even though there were a number of fine teachers who did not get very involved in these intense fights between different schools of thought (such as Richard Stone, Brian Reddaway, Robin Matthews, Kenneth Berrill, Aubrey Silberston, Robin Marris), the political lines were, in general, very firmly - and rather bizarrely - drawn. In an obvious sense, the Keynesians were to the \"left\" of the neo-classicists, but this was very much in the spirit of \"this far but no further\". Also, there was no way in which the different economists could be nicely ordered in just one dimension. Maurice Dobb, who was an astute Marxist economist, was often thought by Keynesians and neo-Keynesians to be \"quite soft\" on \"neo-classical\" economics. He was one of the few who, to my delight, took welfare economics seriously (and indeed taught a regular course on it), just as the intensely \"neo-classical\" A.C. Pigou had done (while continuing to debate Keynes in macroeconomics). Not surprisingly, when the Marxist Dobb defeated Kaldor in an election to the Faculty Board, Kaldor declared it to be a victory of the perfidious neo-classical economics in disguise (\"marginal utility theory has won,\" Kaldor told Sraffa that evening, in commenting on the electoral success of a Marxist economist!) However, Kaldor was, in fact, much the most tolerant of the neo-Keynesians at Cambridge. If Richard Kahn was in general the most bellicose, the stern reproach that I received often for not being quite true to the new orthodoxy of neo-Keynesianism came mostly from my thesis supervisor - the totally brilliant but vigorously intolerant Joan Robinson. In this desert of constant feuding, my own college, Trinity, was a bit of an oasis. I suppose I was lucky to be there, but it was not entirely luck, since I had chosen to apply to Trinity after noticing, in the handbook of Cambridge University, that three remarkable economists of very different political views coexisted there. The Marxist Maurice Dobb and the conservative neo-classicist Dennis Robertson did joint seminars, and Trinity also had Piero Sraffa, a model of scepticism of nearly all the standard schools of thought. I had the good fortune of working with all of them and learning greatly from each. The peaceful - indeed warm - co-existence of Dobb, Robertson and Sraffa was quite remarkable, given the feuding in the rest of the University. Sraffa told me, later on, a nice anecdote about Dobb's joining of Trinity, on the invitation of Robertson. When asked by Robertson whether he would like to teach at Trinity, Dobb said yes enthusiastically, but he suffered later from a deep sense of guilt in not having given Robertson \"the full facts. \" So he wrote a letter to Robertson apologizing for not having mentioned earlier that he was a member of the Communist Party, supplemented by the statement - I think a rather \"English\" statement - that he would understand perfectly if in view of that Robertson were to decide that he, Dobb, was not a fit person to teach Trinity undergraduates. Robertson wrote a one-sentence reply: \"Dear Dobb, so long as you give us a fortnight's notice before blowing up the Chapel, it will be all right.\" So there did exist, to some extent, a nice \"practice\" of democratic and tolerant social choice at Trinity, my own college. But I fear I could not get anyone in Trinity, or in Cambridge, very excited in the \"theory\" of social choice. I had to choose quite a different subject for my research thesis, after completing my B.A. The thesis was on \"the choice of techniques,\" which interested Joan Robinson as well as Maurice Dobb. Philosophy and economics At the end of the first year of research, I was bumptious enough to think that I had some results that would make a thesis, and so I applied to go to India on a two-years leave from Cambridge, since I could not - given the regulation then in force - submit my Ph.D. thesis for a degree until I had been registered for research for three years. I was excitedly impatient in wanting to find out what was going on back at home, and when leave was granted to me, I flew off immediately to Calcutta. Cambridge University insisted on my having a \"supervisor\" in India, and I had the good fortune of having the great economic methodologist, A.K. Dasgupta, who was then teaching in Benares. With him I had frequent - and always enlightening - conversations on everything under the sun (occasionally on my thesis as well). In Calcutta, I was also appointed to a chair in economics at the newly created Jadavpur University, where I was asked to set up a new department of economics. Since I was not yet even 23, this caused a predictable - and entirely understandable - storm of protest. But I enjoyed the opportunity and the challenge (even though several graffitis on the University walls displayed the \"new professor\" as having been just snatched from the cradle). Jadavpur was quite an exciting place intellectually (my colleagues included Paramesh Ray, Mrinal Datta Chaudhuri, Anita Banerji, Ajit Dasgupta, and others in the economics department). The University also had, among other luminaries, the immensely innovative historian, Ranajit Guha, who later initiated the \"subaltern studies\" - a highly influential school of colonial and post-colonial history. I particularly enjoyed getting back to some of the foundational issues that I had to neglect somewhat at Cambridge. While my thesis was quietly \"maturing\" with the mere passage of time (to be worthy of the 3-year rule), I took the liberty of submitting it for a competitive Prize Fellowship at Trinity College. Since, luckily, I also got elected, I then had to choose between continuing in Calcutta and going back to Cambridge. I split the time, and returned to Cambridge somewhat earlier than I had planned. The Prize Fellowship gave me four years of freedom to do anything I liked (no questions asked), and I took the radical decision of studying philosophy in that period. I had always been interested in logic and in epistemology, but soon got involved in moral and political philosophy as well (they related closely to my older concerns about democracy and equity). The broadening of my studies into philosophy was important for me not just because some of my main areas of interest in economics relate quite closely to philosophical disciplines (for example, social choice theory makes intense use of mathematical logic and also draws on moral philosophy, and so does the study of inequality and deprivation), but also because I found philosophical studies very rewarding on their own. Indeed, I went on to write a number of papers in philosophy, particularly in epistemology, ethics and political philosophy. While I am interested both in economics and in philosophy, the union of my interests in the two fields far exceeds their intersection. When, many years later, I had the privilege of working with some major philosophers (such as John Rawls, Isaiah Berlin, Bernard Williams, Ronald Dworkin, Derek Parfit, Thomas Scanlon, Robert Nozick, and others), I felt very grateful to Trinity for having given me the opportunity as well as the courage to get into exacting philosophy. Delhi School of Economics During 1960-61, I visited M.I.T., on leave from Trinity College, and found it a great relief to get away from the rather sterile debates that the contending armies were fighting in Cambridge. I benefited greatly from many conversations with Paul Samuelson, Robert Solow, Franco Modigliani, Norbert Wiener, and others that made M.I.T such an inspiring place. A summer visit to Stanford added to my sense of breadth of economics as a subject. In 1963, I decided to leave Cambridge altogether, and went to Delhi, as Professor of Economics at the Delhi School of Economics and at the University of Delhi. I taught in Delhi until 1971. In many ways this was the most intellectually challenging period of my academic life. Under the leadership of K.N. Raj, a remarkable applied economist who was already in Delhi, we made an attempt to build an advanced school of economics there. The Delhi School was already a good centre for economic study (drawing on the work of V.K.R.V. Rao, B.N. Ganguli, P.N. Dhar, Khaleq Naqvi, Dharm Narain, and many others, in addition to Raj), and a number of new economists joined, including Sukhamoy Chakravarty, Jagdish Bhagwati, A.L. Nagar, Manmohan Singh, Mrinal Datta Chaudhuri, Dharma Kumar, Raj Krishna, Ajit Biswas, K.L. Krishna, Suresh Tendulkar, and others. (Delhi School of Economics also had some leading social anthropologists, such as M.N. Srinivas, Andre Beteille, Baviskar, Veena Das, and major historians such as Tapan Ray Chaudhuri, whose work enriched the social sciences in general.) By the time I left Delhi in 1971 to join the London School of Economics, we had jointly succeeded in making the Delhi School the pre-eminent centre of education in economics and the social sciences, in India. Regarding research, I plunged myself full steam into social choice theory in the dynamic intellectual atmosphere of Delhi University. My interest in the subject was consolidated during a one-year visit to Berkeley in 1964-65, where I not only had the chance to study and teach some social choice theory, but also had the unique opportunity of observing some practical social choice in the form of student activism in the \"free speech movement.\" An initial difficulty in pursuing social choice at the Delhi School was that while I had the freedom to do what I liked, I did not, at first, have anyone who was interested in the subject as a formal discipline. The solution, of course, was to have students take an interest in the subject. This happened with a bang with the arrival of a brilliant student, Prasanta Pattanaik, who did a splendid thesis on voting theory, and later on, also did joint work with me (adding substantially to the reach of what I was trying to do). Gradually, a sizeable and technically excellent group of economists interested in social choice theory emerged at the Delhi School. Social choice theory related importantly to a more widespread interest in aggregation in economic assessment and policy making (related to poverty, inequality, unemployment, real national income, living standards). There was a great reason for satisfaction in the fact that a number of leading social choice theorists (in addition to Prasanta Pattanaik) emanated from the Delhi School, including Kaushik Basu and Rajat Deb (who also studied with me at the London School of Economics after I moved there), and Bhaskar Dutta and Manimay Sengupta, among others. There were other students who were primarily working in other areas (this applies to Basu as well), but whose work and interests were influenced by the strong current of social choice theory at the Delhi School (Nanak Kakwani is a good example of this). In my book, Collective Choice and Social Welfare, published in 1970, I made an effort to take on overall view of social choice theory. There were a number of analytical findings to report, but despite the presence of many \"trees\" (in the form of particular technical results), I could not help looking anxiously for the forest. I had to come back again to the old general question that had moved me so much in my teenage years at Presidency College: Is reasonable social choice at all possible given the differences between one person's preferences (including interests and judgments) and another's (indeed, as Horace noted a long time ago, there may be \"as many preferences as there are people\")? The work underlying Collective Choice and Social Welfare was mostly completed in Delhi, but I was much helped in giving it a final shape by a joint course on \"social justice\" I taught at Harvard with Kenneth Arrow and John Rawls, both of whom were wonderfully helpful in giving me their assessments and suggestions. The joint course was, in fact, quite a success both in getting many important issues discussed, and also in involving a remarkable circle of participants (who were sitting in as \"auditors\"), drawn from the established economists and philosophers in the Harvard region. (It was also quite well-known outside the campus: I was asked by a neighbour in a plane journey to San Francisco whether, as a teacher at Harvard, I had heard of an \"apparently interesting\" course taught by \"Kenneth Arrow, John Rawls, and some unknown guy.\") There was another course I taught jointly, with Stephen Marglin and Prasanta Pattanaik (who too had come to Harvard), which was concerned with development as well as Policy making. This nicely supplemented my involvements in pure social choice theory (in fact, Marglin and Pattanaik were both very interested in examining the connection between social choice theory and other areas in economics). From Delhi to London and Oxford I left Delhi, in 1971, shortly after Collective Choice and Social Welfare was published in 1970. My wife, Nabaneeta Dev, with whom I have two children (Antara and Nandana), had constant trouble with her health in Delhi (mainly from asthma). London might have suited her better, but, as it happens, the marriage broke up shortly after we went to London. Nabaneeta is a remarkably successful poet, literary critic and writer of novels and short stories (one of the most celebrated authors in contemporary Bengali literature), which she has combined, since our divorce, with being a University Professor at Jadavpur University in Calcutta. I learned many things from her, including the appreciation of poetry from an \"internal\" perspective. She had worked earlier on the distinctive style and composition of epic poetry, including the Sanskrit epics (particularly the Ramayana), and this I had got very involved in. Nabaneeta's parents were very well-known poets as well, and she seems to have borne her celebrity status - and the great many recognitions that have come her way - with unaffected approachability and warmth. She had visits from an unending stream of literary fans, and I understand, still does. (On one occasion, arrived a poet with a hundred new poems, with the declared intention of reading them aloud to her, to get her critical judgement, but since she was out, he said that he would instead settle for reading them to me. When I pleaded that I lacked literary sophistication, I was assured by the determined poet: \"That is just right; I would like to know how the common man may react to my poetry.\" The common man, I am proud to say, reacted with appropriate dignity and self-control.) When we moved to London, I was also going through some serious medical problems. In early 1952, at the age of 18 (when I was an undergraduate at Presidency College), I had cancer of the mouth, and it had been dealt with by a severe dose of radiation in a rather primitive Calcutta hospital. This was only seven years after Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the long-run effects of radiation were not much understood. The dose of radiation I got may have cured the cancer, but it also killed the bones in my hard palate. By 1971, it appeared that I had either a recurrence of the cancer, or a severe case of bone necrosis. The first thing I had to do on returning to England was to have a serious operation, without knowing whether it would be merely plastic surgery to compensate for the necrosis (a long and complicated operation in the mouth, but no real threat to survival), or much more demandingly, a fresh round of efforts at cancer eradication. After the long operation (it had lasted nearly seven hours) when I woke up from the heavy anaesthesia, it was four o'clock in the morning. As a person with much impatience, I wanted to know what the surgeon had found. The nurse on duty said she was not allowed to tell me anything: \"You must wait for the doctors to come at nine.\" This created some tension (I wanted to know what had emerged), which the nurse noticed. I could see that she was itching to tell me something: indeed (as I would know later) to tell me that no recurrence of cancer had been detected in the frozen-section biopsy that had been performed, and that the long operation was mainly one of reconstruction of the palate to compensate for the necrosis. She ultimately gave in, and chose an interesting form of communication, which I found quite striking (as well as kind). \"You know,\" she said, \"they were praising you very much!\" It then dawned on me that not having cancer can be a subject for praise. Indeed lulled by praise, I went quietly back to my post-operative sleep. In later years, when I would try to work on judging the goodness of a society by the quality of health of the people, her endorsement of my praiseworthiness for being cancer-free would serve as a good reference point! The intellectual atmosphere at the LSE in particular and in London in general was most gratifying, with a dazzling array of historians, economists, sociologists and others. It was wonderful to have the opportunity of seeing Eric Hobsbawm (the great historian) and his wife Marlene very frequently and to interact regularly with Frank and Dorothy Hahn, Terence and Dorinda Gorman, and many others. Our small neighbourhood in London (Bartholomew estate, within the Kentish Town) itself offered wonderful company of intellectual and artistic creativity and political involvement. Even after I took an Oxford job (Professor of Economics, 1977-80, Drummond Professor of Political Economy, 1980-87) later on, I could not be budged from living in London. As I settled down at the London School of Economics in 1971, I resumed my work on social choice theory. Again, I had excellent students at LSE, and later on at Oxford. In addition to Kaushik Basu and Rajat Deb (who had come from Dehli), other students such as Siddiq Osmani, Ben Fine, Ravi Kanbur, Carl Hamilton, John Wriglesworth, David Kelsey, Yasumi Matsumoto, Jonathan Riley, produced distinguished Ph.D. theses on a variety of economic and social choice problems. It made me very proud that many of the results that became standard in social choice theory and welfare economics had first emerged in these Ph.D. theses. I was also fortunate to have colleagues who were working on serious social choice problems, including Peter Hammond, Charles Blackorby, Kotaro Suzumura, Geoffrey Heal, Gracieda Chichilnisky, Ken Binmore, Wulf Gaertner, Eric Maskin, John Muellbauer, Kevin Roberts, Susan Hurley, at LSE or Oxford, or neighbouring British universities. (I also learned greatly from conversations with economists who were in other fields, but whose works were of great interest to me, including Sudhir Anand, Tony Atkinson, Christopher Bliss, Meghnad Desai, Terence Gorman, Frank Hahn, David Hendry, Richard Layard, James Mirrlees, John Muellbauer, Steve Nickel, among others.) I also had the opportunity of collaboration with social choice theorists elsewhere, such as Claude d'Aspremont and Louis Gevers in Belgium, Koichi Hamada and Ken-ichi Inada in Japan (joined later by Suzumura when he returned there), and many others in America, Canada, Israel, Australia, Russia, and elsewhere). There were many new formal results and informal understandings that emerged in these works, and the gloom of \"impossibility results\" ceased to be the only prominent theme in the field. The 1970s were probably the golden years of social choice theory across the world. Personally, I had the sense of having a ball. From social choice to inequality and poverty The constructive possibilities that the new literature on social choice produced directed us immediately to making use of available statistics for a variety of economic and social appraisals: measuring economic inequality, judging poverty, evaluating projects, analyzing unemployment, investigating the principles and implications of liberty and rights, assessing gender inequality, and so on. My work on inequality was much inspired and stimulated by that of Tony Atkinson. I also worked for a while with Partha Dasgupta and David Starrett on measuring inequality (after having worked with Dasgupta and Stephen Marglin on project evaluation), and later, more extensively, with Sudhir Anand and James Foster. My own interests gradually shifted from the pure theory of social choice to more \"practical\" problems. But I could not have taken them on without having some confidence that the practical exercises to be undertaken were also foundationally secure (rather than implicitly harbouring incongruities and impossibilities that could be exposed on deeper analytical probing). The progress of the pure theory of social choice with an expanded informational base was, in this sense, quite crucial for my applied work as well. In the reorientation of my research, I benefited greatly from discussions with my wife, Eva Colorni, with whom I lived from 1973 onwards. Her critical standards were extremely exacting, but she also wanted to encourage me to work on issues of practical moment. Her personal background involved a fine mixture of theory and practice, with an Italian Jewish father (Eugenio Colorni was an academic philosopher and a hero of the Italian resistance who was killed by the fascists in Rome shortly before the Americans got there), a Berlinite Jewish mother (Ursula Hirschman was herself a writer and the brother of the great development economist, Albert Hirschman), and a stepfather who as a statesman had been a prime mover in uniting Europe (Altiero Spinelli was the founder of the \"European Federalist movement,\" wrote its \"Manifesto\" from prison in 1941, and officially established the new movement, in the company of Eugenio Colorni, in Milan in 1943). Eva herself had studied law, philosophy and economics (in Pavia and in Delhi), and lectured at the City of London Polytechnic (now London Guildhall University). She was deeply humane (with a great passion for social justice) as well as fiercely rational (taking no theory for granted, subjecting each to reasoned assessment and scrutiny). She exercised a great influence on the standards and reach that I attempted to achieve in my work (often without adequate success). Eva was very supportive of my attempt to use a broadened framework of social choice theory in a variety of applied problems: to assess poverty; to evaluate inequality; to clarify the nature of relative deprivation; to develop distribution-adjusted national income measures; to clarify the penalty of unemployment; to analyze violations of personal liberties and basic rights; and to characterize gender disparities and women's relative disadvantage. The results were mostly published in journals in the 1970s and early 1980s, but gathered together in two collections of articles (Choice, Welfare and Measurement and Resources, Values and Development, published, respectively, in 1982 and 1984). The work on gender inequality was initially confined to analyzing available statistics on the male-female differential in India (I had a joint paper with Jocelyn Kynch on \"Indian Women: Well-being and Survival\" in 1982), but gradually moved to international comparisons (Commodities and Capabilities, 1985) and also to some general theory (\"Gender and Cooperative Conflict,\" 1990). The theory drew both on empirical analysis of published statistics across the world, but also of data I freshly collected in India in the spring of 1983, in collaboration with Sunil Sengupta, comparing boys and girls from birth to age 5. (We weighed and studied every child in two largish villages in West Bengal; I developed some expertise in weighing protesting children, and felt quite proud of my accomplishment when, one day, my research assistant phoned me with a request to take over from her the job of weighing a child \"who bites every hand within the reach of her teeth.\" I developed some vanity in being able to meet the challenge at the \"biting end\" of social choice research.) Poverty, famines and deprivation From the mid-1970s, I also started work on the causation and prevention of famines. This was initially done for the World Employment Programme of the International Labour Organization, for which my 1981 book Poverty and Famines was written. (Louis Emmerij who led the programme took much personal interest in the work I was trying to do on famines.) I attempted to see famines as broad \"economic\" problems (concentrating on how people can buy food, or otherwise get entitled to it), rather than in terms of the grossly undifferentiated picture of aggregate food supply for the economy as a whole. The work was carried on later (from the middle of 1980s) under the auspices of the World Institute of Development Economics Research (WIDER) in Helsinki, which was imaginatively directed by Lal Jayawardena (an old friend who, as I noted earlier, had also been a contemporary of mine at Cambridge in the 1950s). Siddiq Osmani, my ex-student, ably led the programme on hunger and deprivation at WIDER. I also worked closely with Martha Nussbaum on the cultural side of the programme, during 1987-89. By the mid-1980s, I was collaborating extensively with Jean Drèze, a young Belgian economist of extraordinary skill and remarkable dedication. My understanding of hunger and deprivation owes a great deal to his insights and investigations, and so does my recent work on development, which has been mostly done jointly with him. Indeed, my collaboration with Jean has been extremely fruitful for me, not only because I have learned so much from his, imaginative initiatives and insistent thoroughness, but also because it is hard to beat an arrangement for joint work whereby Jean does most of the work whereas I get a lot of the credit. While these were intensely practical matters, I also got more and more involved in trying to understand the nature of individual advantage in terms of the substantive freedoms that different persons respectively enjoy, in the form of the capability to achieve valuable things. If my work in social choice theory was initially motivated by a desire to overcome Arrow's pessimistic picture by going beyond his limited informational base, my work on social justice based on individual freedoms and capabilities was similarly motivated by an aspiration to learn from, but go beyond, John Rawls's elegant theory of justice, through a broader use of available information. My intellectual life has been much influenced by the contributions as well as the wonderful helpfulness of both Arrow and Rawls. Harvard and beyond In the late 1980s, I had reason to move again from where I was. My wife, Eva, developed a difficult kind of cancer (of the stomach), and died quite suddenly in 1985. We had young children (Indrani and Kabir - then 10 and 8 respectively), and I wanted to take them away to another country, where they would not miss their mother constantly. The liveliness of America appealed to us as an alternative location, and I took the children with me to \"taste\" the prospects in the American universities that made me an offer. Indrani and Kabir rapidly became familiar with several campuses (Stanford, Berkeley, Yale, Princeton, Harvard, UCLA, University of Texas at Austin, among them), even though their knowledge of America outside academia remained rather limited. (They particularly enjoyed visiting their grand uncle and aunt, Albert and Sarah Hirschman, at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton; as a Trustee of the Institute, visits to Princeton were also very pleasurable occasions for me.) I guess I was, to some extent, imposing my preference for the academic climate on the children, by confining the choice to universities only, but I did not really know what else to do. However, I must confess that I worried a little when I overheard my son Kabir, then nine years old, responding to a friendly American's question during a plane journey as to whether he knew Washington, D.C.. \"Is that city,\" I heard Kabir say, \"closer to Palo Alto or to New Haven?\" We jointly chose Harvard, and it worked out extremely well. My colleagues in economics and philosophy were just superb, some of whom I knew well from earlier on (including John Rawls and Tim Scanlon in philosophy, and Zvi Griliches, Dale Jorgenson, Janos Kornai, Stephen Marglin in economics), but there were also others whom I came to know after arriving at Harvard. I greatly enjoyed teaching regular joint courses with Robert Nozick and Eric Maskin, and also on occasions, with John Rawls and Thomas Scanlon (in philosophy) and with Jerry Green, Stephen Marglin and David Bloom (in economics). I could learn also from academics in many other fields as well, not least at the Society of Fellows where I served as a Senior Fellow for nearly a decade. Also, I was again blessed with wonderful students in economics, philosophy, public health and government, who did excellent theses, including Andreas Papandreou (who moved with me from Oxford to Harvard, and did a major book on externality and the environment), Tony Laden (who, among many other things, clarified the game-theoretic structure of Rawlsian theory of justice), Stephan Klasen (whose work on gender inequality in survival is possibly the most definitive work in this area), Felicia Knaul (who worked on street children and the economic and social challenges they face), Jennifer Ruger (who substantially advance the understanding of health as a public policy concern), and indeed many others with whom I greatly enjoyed working. The social choice problems that had bothered me earlier on were by now more analyzed and understood, and I did have, I thought, some understanding of the demands of fairness, liberty and equality. To get firmer understanding of all this, it was necessary to pursue further the search for an adequate characterization of individual advantage. This had been the subject of my Tanner Lectures on Human Values at Stanford in 1979 (published as a paper, \"Equality of What?\" in 1980) and in a more empirical form, in a second set of Tanner Lectures at Cambridge in 1985 (published in 1987 as a volume of essays, edited by Geoffrey Hawthorne, with contributions by Bernard Williams, Ravi Kanbur, John Muellbauer, and Keith Hart). The approach explored sees individual advantage not merely as opulence or utility, but primarily in terms of the lives people manage to live and the freedom they have to choose the kind of life they have reason to value. The basic idea here is to pay attention to the actual \"capabilities\" that people end up having. The capabilities depend both on our physical and mental characteristics as well as on social opportunities and influences (and can thus serve as the basis not only of assessment of personal advantage but also of efficiency and equity of social policies). I was trying to explore this approach since my Tanner Lectures in 1979; there was a reasonably ambitious attempt at linking theory to empirical exercises in my book Commodities and Capabilities, published in 1985. In my first few years at Harvard, I was much concerned with developing this perspective further. The idea of capabilities has strong Aristotelian connections, which I came to understand more fully with the help of Martha Nussbaum, a scholar with a remarkably extensive command over classical philosophy as well as contemporary ethics and literary studies. I learned a great deal from her, and we also collaborated in a number of studies during 1987-89, including in a collection of essays that pursued this approach in terms of philosophical as well as economic reasoning (Quality of Life was published in 1993, but the essays were from a conference at WIDER in Helsinki in 1988). During my Harvard years up to about 1991, I was much involved in analyzing the overall implications of this perspective on welfare economics and political philosophy (this is reported in my book, Inequality Reexamined, published in 1992). But it was also very nice to get involved in some new problems, including the characterization of rationality, the demands of objectivity, and the relation between facts and values. I used the old technique of offering courses on them (sometimes jointly with Robert Nozick) and through that learning as much as I taught. I started taking an interest also in health equity (and in public health in particular, in close collaboration with Sudhir Anand), a challenging field of application for concepts of equity and justice. Harvard's ample strength in an immense variety of subjects gives one scope for much freedom in the choice of work and of colleagues to talk to, and the high quality of the students was a total delight as well. My work on inequality in terms of variables other than incomes was also helped by the collaboration of Angus Deaton and James Foster. It was during my early years at Harvard that my old friend, Mahbub ul Haq, who had been a fellow student at Cambridge (and along with his wife, Bani, a very old and close friend), returned back into my life in a big way. Mahbub's professional life had taken him from Cambridge to Yale, then back to his native Pakistan, with intermediate years at the World Bank. In 1989 he was put in charge, by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), of the newly planned \"Human Development Reports.\" Mahbub insisted that I work with him to help develop a broader informational approach to the assessment of development. This I did with great delight, partly because of the exciting nature of the work, but also because of the opportunity of working closely with such an old and wonderful friend. Human Development Reports seem to have received a good deal of attention in international circles, and Mahbub was very successful in broadening the informational basis of the assessment of development. His sudden death in 1998 has robbed the world of one of the leading practical reasoners in the world of contemporary economics. India and Bangladesh What about India? While I have worked abroad since 1971, I have constantly retained close connections with Indian universities, I have, of course, a special relation with Delhi University, where I have been an honorary professor since leaving my full-time job there in 1971, and I use this excuse to subject Delhi students to lectures whenever I get a chance. For various reasons - personal as well as academic - the peripatetic life seems to suit me, in this respect. After my student days in Cambridge in 1953-56, I guess I have never been away from India for more than six months at a time. This - combined with my remaining exclusively an Indian citizen - gives me, I think, some entitlement to speak on Indian public affairs, and this remains a constant involvement. It is also very engaging - and a delight - to go back to Bangladesh as often as I can, which is not only my old home, but also where some of my closest friends and collaborators live and work. This includes Rehman Sobhan to whom I have been very close from my student days (he remains as sceptical of formal economics and its reach as he was in the early 1950s), and also Anisur Rehman (who is even more sceptical), Kamal Hossain, Jamal Islam, Mushairaf Hussain, among many others, who are all in Bangladesh. When the Nobel award came my way, it also gave me an opportunity to do something immediate and practical about my old obsessions, including literacy, basic health care and gender equity, aimed specifically at India and Bangladesh. The Pratichi Trust, which I have set up with the help of some of the prize money, is, of course, a small effort compared with the magnitude of these problems. But it is nice to re-experience something of the old excitement of running evening schools, more than fifty years ago, in villages near Santiniketan. From campus to campus As far as my principal location is concerned, now that my children have grown up, I could seize the opportunity to move back to my old Cambridge college, Trinity. I accepted the offer of becoming Master of the College from January 1998 (though I have not cut my connections with Harvard altogether). The reasoning was not independent of the fact that Trinity is not only my old college where my academic life really began, but it also happens to be next door to King's, where my wife, Emma Rothschild, is a Fellow, and Director of the Centre for History and Economics. Her forthcoming book on Adam Smith also takes on the hard task of reinterpreting the European Enlightenment. It so happens that one principal character in this study is Condorcet, who was also one of the originators of social choice theory, which is very pleasing (and rather useful as well). Emma too is a convinced academic (a historian and an economist), and both her parents had long connections with Cambridge and with the University. Between my four children, and the two of us, the universities that the Sen family has encountered include Calcutta University, Cambridge University, Jadavpur University, Delhi University, L.S.E., Oxford University, Harvard University, M.I.T., University of California at Berkeley, Stanford University, Cornell University, Smith College, Wesleyan University, among others. Perhaps one day we can jointly write an illustrated guide to the universities. I end this essay where I began - at a university campus. It is not quite the same at 65 as it was at 5. But it is not so bad even at an older age (especially, as Maurice Chevalier has observed, \"considering the alternative\" ). Nor are university campuses quite as far removed from life as is often presumed. Robert Goheen has remarked, \"if you feel that you have both feet planted on level ground, then the university has failed you.\" Right on. But then who wants to be planted on ground? There are places to go. From Les Prix Nobel.

Even though he is high up in the world league of serious thinkers - a Nobel laureate in economics who could also have won the prize for philosophy if the committee recognised the subject - he has achieved something. Sen is a rare example of an intellectual who has had a major effect on politics. His work on the causes of famine changed public perceptions by showing why thousands might starve even when a country's food production has not diminished, and his analysis of poverty has been enormously influential. Arguing that simple measures of GNP were not enough to assess the standard of living, he helped to create the United Nations' Human Development Index, which has become the most authoritative international source of welfare comparisons between countries. As Master of Trinity College, Cambridge since January 1998, and the first Asian to head an Oxbridge college, Sen is also deeply immersed in the debate over globalisation. He has given lectures to senior executives of the World Bank but has also shown his commitment to reform from below by becoming honorary president of Oxfam. Most recently, he courted controversy by criticising the Runnymede report on multi-ethnicity in Britain, chaired by fellow-Asian Lord Parekh, for saying that Britain should be seen as a loose federation of cultures held together by common bonds of interest. Though this was meant to be a modern liberal vision, Sen feels it devalues individual identity, risks lumping people into \"communities\" they may not want to be part of, and interferes with a person's freedom to make her own choices. (Among his many contributions to development economics, Sen has produced pioneering studies of gender inequality, so he always takes care to write \"her\" rather than \"his\" when referring to an abstract person). He also jumped into the argument over human rights and \"Asian values\", taking strong issue with Singapore's former prime minister, Lee Kuan Yew, for claiming that liberalism was a Western export unsuited to Asia. But Sen's line was not the conventional view that individual liberty is a western invention which needs to have universal application. Rather, he argued that \"the championing of democracy and political freedom in the modern sense cannot be found in the pre-enlightenment tradition in any part of the world, west or east\". However, separate components of this progressive idea - from religious tolerance to egalitarianism and support for a climate of debate - have come and gone in many different cultures at various historical times. As he sits in the bay window of his elegant rooms looking out over Trinity's Great Court, dressed in baggy corduroys and a well worn tweed jacket, he looks the part of a man who is completely captivated by the seductive mix of social comfort, institutional prestige and intellectual challenge which academia at its best can provide. His carefully qualified answers and detailed recall of the themes and sub-themes of his books and articles, as well as their exact publication dates, reveal a mind and memory as sharp as his manner is gentle. The strongest features of his work, joining his economics and philosophy together, are ethics and a sense of common humanity. \"He's very concerned about justice\", says Sudhir Anand, professor of economics at Oxford. \"He's made major contributions not only in measuring poverty but understanding it. To him, poverty is the lack of capability to function, so reducing it is related to positive freedom. What's important to people is to be able to do and be.\" Sen's fellow economists love the way he has given the subject a friendlier image ,yet he was not awarded the Nobel prize for his more accessible work in development economics, but for \"social choice theory\", the philosophical foundation backed by mathematics which supports all his writings. The only surprise with his Nobel prize was that it came so late. \"It was only political reasons which prevented him getting it earlier,\" says his old friend, the historian Eric Hobsbawm. \"Ever since the mid-70s the Swedish committee has been strongly committed to free-market theory, until it took a real punch in the midriff in 97/98 with the Asian crisis.\" Though he has strong political views, Sen has generally avoided political statements in public. He is primarily an academic who wants his ideas to cascade through the institutions by virtue of their intellectual force, and then flow into general circulation as the new wisdom. \"He's peculiarly shy about talking politics publicly. It's a kind of self-denial,\" says Meghnad Desai, director of the centre for the study of global governance at the LSE. \"It's also a generational thing. Good economists, when he started out, didn't get into politics. So he prefers to be subversive in a technical way.\" This abstinence, as well as his soft-spoken manner, are the main reasons why Sen is relatively little-known outside the academic arena in Britain and the United States, the two countries where he has spent most of his time. Only in his native India is he a star, and when he won the Nobel prize in 1998 he was dubbed the Mother Theresa of Economics as crowds followed him around - \"wanting to touch his fountain pen,\" in Hobsbawm's words. \"The fact that he had made it in Britain gave him tremendous cachet in India, particularly among the 200,000 or so English-speakers who still run the country,\" he adds. Among academics Sen's reputation is almost unrivalled. He has served as a full-time or visiting professor at a dozen of the world's most prestigious universities, and must hold the record for the highest number of honorary degrees (53 according to his CV). He conscientiously turns up to receive each one and is usually asked to give a speech, winning himself the family nickname: Amartya Commencement Sen. \"He has a mind like a searchlight, yet he works at Mozartian speed. His output is staggering in its volume,\" comments Robert Cassen, an economist at the LSE. \"Sen has made fundamental contributions to at least four fields: social choice theory, welfare economics, economic measurement, and development economics,\" says Sudhir Anand. \"The pre-eminence that he has achieved in each of these different fields is remarkable for any scholar: that he has achieved pre-eminence in so many is utterly extraordinary. He is held in enormously high respect by theoretical, empirical and policy economists alike - to say nothing of philosophers and political theorists.\" Sen has spent almost his entire adult life on various university campuses, and was even born on one. His father taught chemistry at Dhaka University (now in Bangladesh) but Amartya came into the world in 1933 at Santiniketan, just north of Calcutta, on the campus of a small, progressive co-ed school and college founded by the writer, philosopher and poet, Rabindranath Tagore. Tagore was a close friend of Sen's maternal grandfather who taught Sanskrit at Santiniketan. Tagore helped to choose the baby's name, which means \"immortal\" in Sanskrit. Sen's mother was a writer who performed in many of the dance-dramas which Tagore wrote. She still edits a literary magazine in Bengal. \"Tagore founded Santiniketan with the idea of creating something different from the English-language Raj kind of school,\" says Sen. \"It also differed from the Indian nationalist school. The teaching language was Bengali, and the place was very self-consciously international, with a sense of global culture. The existence of a Europe outside Britain was more easily conceded in Santiniketan than happened in the rest of the Raj.\" But the school was not for the poor, and when Sen was still only nine, he underwent a profound experience. \"One day a chap came wandering in, very obviously deranged. Some of the nastier boys were being unpleasant to him and some of us felt we had to do something to help. I got chatting to the man and it became quite clear he hadn't eaten for about 40 days. But then one, 10, it seemed like about 100,000 people came walking through the campus on the way to Calcutta to find some charities which might help them.\" Until this shock Sen was blissfully unaware of suffering. No one in his family, which he calls lower middle-class, nor any of his friends' families, were affected by the famine. \"I was upset by what I saw. My grandfather gave me a small cigarette tin, and said I could fill it with rice and give it to the starving, but only one tinful per family,\" he explains. The famine was clearly class-dependent. Only people on the lowest rung of the economic ladder, such as landless rural labourers, were hungry, and the memory stayed with Sen, prompting him several decades later to do his study of that famine and several others in the Sahel, Ethiopia and China. The opening lines of his study are typical of his lapidary style: \"Starvation is the characteristic of some people not having enough food to eat. It is not the characteristic of there being not enough food to eat.\" After examining the records, he found that overall food output in Bengal in 1943 was not lower than in 1941, when there was no famine. The real problem was that the wages paid to farm labourers in 1942 had not kept up with the rising price of food caused by inflation in Calcutta, which was going through a boom as the Raj put money into war production. This resulted in what Sen called a shift in \"entitlements\": labourers had suffered a reduction in their ability to command power over food. As he was entering his teens, Sen had what he calls another \"devastating\" political experience. The \"idea of India\", with its rich cultural heterogeneity, which he had learned at Santiniketan, collapsed into a welter of sectarian identities when people started to define themselves as Hindus, Muslims or Sikhs, and went on killing sprees. One afternoon at the family home in Dhaka a man rushed through the gate, screaming and bleeding. Sen's father took him to hospital. The man was a Muslim labourer who had been set upon by Hindu thugs after looking for work in a Hindu area because his family was short of food. The episode turned him against the idea of prioritising communal identity, and gave him another graphic lesson in the way economic unfreedom can make people prey to serious violations of their rights. By then Sen was already bent on an academic career. He knew he wanted to be a teacher or researcher of some sort, though his interests wavered. \"I seriously flirted in turn with Sanskrit, mathematics and physics, before settling on the eccentric charms of economics,\" he says. He went to the Presidency College in Calcutta and was soon thrown into the hotbed of political coffee-house debate. His family belonged to the Bengali intellectual elite, and Bengal itself was the most vibrant and politically active city in India. Most of its luminaries were well to the left of Mahatma Gandhi and Nehru. One of Sen's uncles, who belonged to the Congress Socialist Party, was put into preventive detention by the British and spent six years in prison without trial. Another cousin, in the Communist party, was also in gaol. Although Sen eagerly joined in the arguments, he says: \"I could not develop enough enthusiasm to join any political party.\" It was an early sign of his detachment from collective action, as well as the pragmatic caution which have stayed with him, in spite of his moral engagement and intellectual boldness. In the early 60s, when he was at Trinity College, Cambridge, as director of studies, his then wife, Nabaneeta Dev, went on the Aldermaston ban-the-bomb marches led by Bertrand Russell. Sen did not. It was partly pressure of work, he says, but \"I had also developed more scepticism of what could be achieved by activism without necessarily weakening on the importance of the cause\". Sen still calls himself a person of the left, but he says he felt something disturbing about the standard leftwing politics of his student days. Most of his friends were Stalinists. He liked their egalitarian commitment but felt they were not open to political pluralism and that they even saw political tolerance as a \"weakness of will\". \"I thought it was a major defect of the Stalinist left not to recognise that establishing democracy in India had been an enormous step forward. There was a temptation to call this sham or bourgeois democracy. The left didn't take seriously enough the disastrous lack of democracy in Communist countries,\" he recalls. This point was to stay with him in his famine studies, when he enunciated the view that no famine has ever occurred in a country with a free press and regular elections. He compared China and India. Although by most indicators, from life expectancy to literacy, Mao's China was ahead of Nehru's India, China had had a catastrophic famine between 1958 and 1961 in which up to 30m people starved to death. There was no free press or alternative political parties to give early warning. In democratic India, free from the Raj, this could not have happened. But Sen did not go overboard in his praise of democracy. He pointed out in his 1984 book, Resources, Values, and Democracy, that while there was no famine in India, a third of the population went to bed hungry every night. \"The quiet presence of non-acute, endemic hunger leads to no newspaper turmoil, no political agitation, no riots in the Indian parliament. The system takes it in his stride,\" he wrote. When Sen arrived in Cambridge at the age of 19 to study economics at Trinity, he found the college \"a bit of an oasis\". The major debates in political economy in the university were raging between neo-classicists and followers of Keynes. Trinity was an unusual model of tolerance ,with the Marxist, Maurice Dobb, doing joint seminars with the conservative, Dennis Robertson. Sen found that this suited his style. He has always rejected any simplistic labelling of people, and his work is constantly peppered with references to earlier economists whom he respects for their views, regardless of the ideological camps which form around them. He takes examples from Adam Smith, as well as Marx, without being a Smithian or a Marxist. In 1960, Sen married Nabaneeta Dev, whom he first got to know when she was a student of comparative literature and he was a young professor at Jadavpur University in Calcutta. He met her off the boat train when she came to England in 1959. He proposed soon afterwards and they had two daughters. Antara, 37, became a journalist and edits a political, cultural, and literary magazine, called The Little Magazine, in Delhi. Nandana, 33, is an actress and film director, and lives in New York and Bombay. In 1970, S en's path-breaking book, Collective Choice and Social Welfare, attempted to rescue welfare economics from the pessimism of free-marketeers, who argued that there was no point in government intervention, and that individuals should be left to choose whatever the market made available in response to their choices, and statists, who concluded that authoritarian choices had to be made by governments on other people's behalf. Sen argued that perfection in social decision-mak ing is unnecessary. Partial comparisons between people can help and majority decisions do carry weight, as long as the interests of the less assertive citizens are not ignored. His own life, meanwhile, had its periods of turmoil and tragedy. While an undergraduate, he developed cancer of the mouth and he was treated with massive doses of radiation. It whittled away his palate and could have proved fatal: he was unable to eat solid food for three months and doctors said he only had a 15% chance of survival. In 1971 there were fears that the cancer had recurred but, after a while, the diagnosis proved wrong. That same year, Sen left Dev. She had followed him around the various campuses where his work took him, and developed her own academic career in a very different intellectual area. (By the time of the divorce, she was well-known in Bengal as a a writer and professor of literature, and the separation caused a storm there.) He describes her generously \"as one of the best-known literary names in Bengal, a leading poet and novelist\". She has described him as \"a good economist but a bad money manager\", and \"a clumsy father until the children grew old enough to be his students\". Sen later started to go out with Eva Colorni, a brilliant Italian economist from a distinguished anti-fascist family, whom he had met some years earlier. The couple married in 1978, but Colorni died of cancer in 1985, leaving Sen with a 10-year-old daughter, Indrani, and eight-year-old son, Kabir. Partly in search of a change of scene, and partly because he needed a higher salary as a single father of two young children, he left Britain for Harvard. (His first two children stayed with Dev.) In the United States he renewed contact with an old student friend, the brilliant Pakistani economist, Mahbub ul Haq, who persuaded him to join in elaborating the Human Development Index as a rival to the World Bank's system of ranking countries by classical macroeconomic criteria such as savings rates and GNP. \"Amartya gave it intellectual depth and credibility. Before that people thought it was just flaky, feelgood stuff,\" says Richard Jolly, who worked for the United Nations Children's Fund and is writing a history of the UN. \"I'm struck by the way he has made so many contributions to the UN over the last three decades.\" Despite his advice for the UN, Sen has been coy about working for individual governments. He turned down numerous invitations to advise the Indian government. In Britain he has given a talk at one of Gordon Brown's regular economic seminars at 11 Downing Street, but he politely avoids any public comment on New Labour and the Third Way. Sen's empirical work has occasionally been criticised on points of detail, or for not going far enough. Alex de Waal, the author of Famine Crimes, a book which looked at how democracy prevents famine, says the mere fact of democracy is not enough. He also says the main cause of famine is epidemic disease rather than starvation. But he describes Sen's work as \"seminal\". An article Sen wrote in the British Medical Journal, which appeared in the New York Review of Books with the headline, \"More than a Hundred Million Women are Missing\", was picked apart by some demographers. Sen had examined the disturbing fact that while female mortality is generally lower than male mortality at all age-groups in most cultures, this is not the case in India. Because of massive gender inequality, girls have less food and are taken to doctors less than boys. Sen accepts that that criticism of his \"ballpark figure\" was legitimate, but says his main point about inequality cannot be challenged. More substantial criticisms revolve round his role in the current globalisation debate. Richard Jolly, while being an enormous admirer, says: \"On the issue of liberalisation and the opening up of economies, Amartya has been rather mainstream. He hasn't raised very deep questions about the whole process and of globalisation in general. He's more of a mainstream economist than many people realise.\" Meghnad Desai sees a double problem. One is the issue of accessibility. Desai cites Sen's latest book, Development as Freedom, which is based on a set of lectures he gave the World Bank in 1996. Desai describes it as written for the converted, as well as being too dense. (Even though advertised as the work of a Nobel laureate, the book sold less than 3,000 copies in hardback.) \"Amartya won't admit it but he's very badly hurt if he's criticised . . . He can't let go of this armour of the technical thing. He can't write a tract, or doesn't want to,\" he says. Desai also feels Sen has failed to come clean on a major change of mind. \"He used to be anti-market and very sympathetic to the Nehru line. Then he found a clever way round it. During the past 20 years he's finally made his peace with the market, though on his own terms and without going all-out for a free market. It's a higher form of reconciliation,\" he argues. TN Srinavasan, economics professor at Yale and a long-time colleague, says: \"Many of us were trained in the 50s to believe that states should be active in planning the economy. Sen did not give up that idea until later than some others. He still hasn't added his voice to the call for more privatisation of the Indian economy and the removal of the old Gandhian protection of small-scale producers.\" Sen gets quite heated by the suggestion that he has changed his line on the market. \"Nothing I've ever written was anti-market. Being against the market is like being against conversation. It's a form of exchange,\" he snaps. \"But I was just as hostile in the past to giving any privileges to the market as I am now. Besides, those who are great advocates of the market don't always make it easier for people to have access to the market through basic education, credit or whatever.\" He is also stung by the charge that he is middle of the road. \"That depends on how you define the road. There is a road which you can define in which I am in the middle, but part of my problem is to argue that people should be on a different road. I'm really trying to change the road. My frustration is that I have not being very successful in changing the focus of the debate,\" he says. Even in trying to change the road, Sen's line on globalisation is relatively soft. \"Opponents may see globalisation as a new folly, but it is neither particularly new or a folly,\" he says. He supports the \"themes\" raised by anti-capitalist and environmental protesters at Seattle, Prague and Davos, but not their \"theses\", which he finds too simple. He says the problem is not free trade, but the inequality of global power. He strongly welcomes the rise of the NGO movement, which combines with media coverage to produce the beginning of some \"countervailing power\" to the larger corporations and the traditional policies of first world governments. But he also attaches blame to many third-world governments for not undertaking domestic reform. He argues that the United Nations has to be saved from insolvency and given a greater leadership role which escapes from the asymmetry caused by the veto power of the five richest and/or largest countries. \"There needs to be a watchdog institution which is concerned with inequality and fair trade, asks why the USA and Europe are so restrictive to products from the third world, and raises questions about the pricing policy of the drug companies,\" he says. For the past 10 years, Sen has been married to the economic historian, Emma Rothschild, an expert on Adam Smith and Fellow of King's. The two children he brought up on his own have done well. Indrani is a journalist in New York and Kabir teaches music at a school in Boston, and has a rock band called Uncle Trouble. Sen usually spends the winter holidays in India, where he likes to go on long bike rides, and maintains a house in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he and Emma spend the spring and long vacations. Asked how he relaxes, he replies: \"I read a lot and like arguing with people.\" As well as his global interests, he has taken up one local goal. He wants to raise the proportion of state school pupils getting into Trinity. There has been progress, and for the first time last year, the college made more than half (53%) of its offers to state-school pupils. Sen, however, acknowledges there is still a gap, since nationally 65% of students with three A-levels are from state schools. \"This is not a personal initiative,\" he insists. \"The council was already doing it before my time, and the undergraduates on the access committee who visit sixth forms are very keen to explain we are not unfriendly to state schools. My reputation would be mud if I seemed to be trying to take the credit.\" A lifelong believer in equality, in this, as in all his other contributions, he feels the main thing is to reach the correct analysis. He is not a crusader. Others must implement the solutions.

BooksFood for thoughtAs a child, he was deeply affected by an encounter with famine victims. Now an Oxbridge academic and Nobel prize winner, he has spent a lifetime fighting poverty with analysis rather than activism. Known in his native India as the Mother Teresa of economics, his ideas have had a global impact. Jonathan Steele reportsJonathan SteeleSat 31 Mar 2001 05.16 ESTAmartya Sen went to a school in Bengal which promoted curiosity rather than exam results, and he has never forgotten how one of his teachers summed up a classmate: \"She is quite a serious thinker even though her grades are very good.\" In Sen's own case, the epigram needs re-phrasing. Even though he is high up in the world league of serious thinkers - a Nobel laureate in economics who could also have won the prize for philosophy if the committee recognised the subject - he has achieved something. Sen is a rare example of an intellectual who has had a major effect on politics. His work on the causes of famine changed public perceptions by showing why thousands might starve even when a country's food production has not diminished, and his analysis of poverty has been enormously influential. Arguing that simple measures of GNP were not enough to assess the standard of living, he helped to create the United Nations' Human Development Index, which has become the most authoritative international source of welfare comparisons between countries. As Master of Trinity College, Cambridge since January 1998, and the first Asian to head an Oxbridge college, Sen is also deeply immersed in the debate over globalisation. He has given lectures to senior executives of the World Bank but has also shown his commitment to reform from below by becoming honorary president of Oxfam. Most recently, he courted controversy by criticising the Runnymede report on multi-ethnicity in Britain, chaired by fellow-Asian Lord Parekh, for saying that Britain should be seen as a loose federation of cultures held together by common bonds of interest. Though this was meant to be a modern liberal vision, Sen feels it devalues individual identity, risks lumping people into \"communities\" they may not want to be part of, and interferes with a person's freedom to make her own choices. (Among his many contributions to development economics, Sen has produced pioneering studies of gender inequality, so he always takes care to write \"her\" rather than \"his\" when referring to an abstract person). He also jumped into the argument over human rights and \"Asian values\", taking strong issue with Singapore's former prime minister, Lee Kuan Yew, for claiming that liberalism was a Western export unsuited to Asia. But Sen's line was not the conventional view that individual liberty is a western invention which needs to have universal application. Rather, he argued that \"the championing of democracy and political freedom in the modern sense cannot be found in the pre-enlightenment tradition in any part of the world, west or east\". However, separate components of this progressive idea - from religious tolerance to egalitarianism and support for a climate of debate - have come and gone in many different cultures at various historical times. As he sits in the bay window of his elegant rooms looking out over Trinity's Great Court, dressed in baggy corduroys and a well worn tweed jacket, he looks the part of a man who is completely captivated by the seductive mix of social comfort, institutional prestige and intellectual challenge which academia at its best can provide. His carefully qualified answers and detailed recall of the themes and sub-themes of his books and articles, as well as their exact publication dates, reveal a mind and memory as sharp as his manner is gentle. The strongest features of his work, joining his economics and philosophy together, are ethics and a sense of common humanity. \"He's very concerned about justice\", says Sudhir Anand, professor of economics at Oxford. \"He's made major contributions not only in measuring poverty but understanding it. To him, poverty is the lack of capability to function, so reducing it is related to positive freedom. What's important to people is to be able to do and be.\" Sen's fellow economists love the way he has given the subject a friendlier image ,yet he was not awarded the Nobel prize for his more accessible work in development economics, but for \"social choice theory\", the philosophical foundation backed by mathematics which supports all his writings. The only surprise with his Nobel prize was that it came so late. \"It was only political reasons which prevented him getting it earlier,\" says his old friend, the historian Eric Hobsbawm. \"Ever since the mid-70s the Swedish committee has been strongly committed to free-market theory, until it took a real punch in the midriff in 97/98 with the Asian crisis.\" Though he has strong political views, Sen has generally avoided political statements in public. He is primarily an academic who wants his ideas to cascade through the institutions by virtue of their intellectual force, and then flow into general circulation as the new wisdom. \"He's peculiarly shy about talking politics publicly. It's a kind of self-denial,\" says Meghnad Desai, director of the centre for the study of global governance at the LSE. \"It's also a generational thing. Good economists, when he started out, didn't get into politics. So he prefers to be subversive in a technical way.\" This abstinence, as well as his soft-spoken manner, are the main reasons why Sen is relatively little-known outside the academic arena in Britain and the United States, the two countries where he has spent most of his time. Only in his native India is he a star, and when he won the Nobel prize in 1998 he was dubbed the Mother Theresa of Economics as crowds followed him around - \"wanting to touch his fountain pen,\" in Hobsbawm's words. \"The fact that he had made it in Britain gave him tremendous cachet in India, particularly among the 200,000 or so English-speakers who still run the country,\" he adds. Among academics Sen's reputation is almost unrivalled. He has served as a full-time or visiting professor at a dozen of the world's most prestigious universities, and must hold the record for the highest number of honorary degrees (53 according to his CV). He conscientiously turns up to receive each one and is usually asked to give a speech, winning himself the family nickname: Amartya Commencement Sen. \"He has a mind like a searchlight, yet he works at Mozartian speed. His output is staggering in its volume,\" comments Robert Cassen, an economist at the LSE. \"Sen has made fundamental contributions to at least four fields: social choice theory, welfare economics, economic measurement, and development economics,\" says Sudhir Anand. \"The pre-eminence that he has achieved in each of these different fields is remarkable for any scholar: that he has achieved pre-eminence in so many is utterly extraordinary. He is held in enormously high respect by theoretical, empirical and policy economists alike - to say nothing of philosophers and political theorists.\" Sen has spent almost his entire adult life on various university campuses, and was even born on one. His father taught chemistry at Dhaka University (now in Bangladesh) but Amartya came into the world in 1933 at Santiniketan, just north of Calcutta, on the campus of a small, progressive co-ed school and college founded by the writer, philosopher and poet, Rabindranath Tagore. Tagore was a close friend of Sen's maternal grandfather who taught Sanskrit at Santiniketan. Tagore helped to choose the baby's name, which means \"immortal\" in Sanskrit. Sen's mother was a writer who performed in many of the dance-dramas which Tagore wrote. She still edits a literary magazine in Bengal. \"Tagore founded Santiniketan with the idea of creating something different from the English-language Raj kind of school,\" says Sen. \"It also differed from the Indian nationalist school. The teaching language was Bengali, and the place was very self-consciously international, with a sense of global culture. The existence of a Europe outside Britain was more easily conceded in Santiniketan than happened in the rest of the Raj.\" But the school was not for the poor, and when Sen was still only nine, he underwent a profound experience. \"One day a chap came wandering in, very obviously deranged. Some of the nastier boys were being unpleasant to him and some of us felt we had to do something to help. I got chatting to the man and it became quite clear he hadn't eaten for about 40 days. But then one, 10, it seemed like about 100,000 people came walking through the campus on the way to Calcutta to find some charities which might help them.\" Until this shock Sen was blissfully unaware of suffering. No one in his family, which he calls lower middle-class, nor any of his friends' families, were affected by the famine. \"I was upset by what I saw. My grandfather gave me a small cigarette tin, and said I could fill it with rice and give it to the starving, but only one tinful per family,\" he explains. The famine was clearly class-dependent. Only people on the lowest rung of the economic ladder, such as landless rural labourers, were hungry, and the memory stayed with Sen, prompting him several decades later to do his study of that famine and several others in the Sahel, Ethiopia and China. The opening lines of his study are typical of his lapidary style: \"Starvation is the characteristic of some people not having enough food to eat. It is not the characteristic of there being not enough food to eat.\" After examining the records, he found that overall food output in Bengal in 1943 was not lower than in 1941, when there was no famine. The real problem was that the wages paid to farm labourers in 1942 had not kept up with the rising price of food caused by inflation in Calcutta, which was going through a boom as the Raj put money into war production. This resulted in what Sen called a shift in \"entitlements\": labourers had suffered a reduction in their ability to command power over food. As he was entering his teens, Sen had what he calls another \"devastating\" political experience. The \"idea of India\", with its rich cultural heterogeneity, which he had learned at Santiniketan, collapsed into a welter of sectarian identities when people started to define themselves as Hindus, Muslims or Sikhs, and went on killing sprees. One afternoon at the family home in Dhaka a man rushed through the gate, screaming and bleeding. Sen's father took him to hospital. The man was a Muslim labourer who had been set upon by Hindu thugs after looking for work in a Hindu area because his family was short of food. The episode turned him against the idea of prioritising communal identity, and gave him another graphic lesson in the way economic unfreedom can make people prey to serious violations of their rights. By then Sen was already bent on an academic career. He knew he wanted to be a teacher or researcher of some sort, though his interests wavered. \"I seriously flirted in turn with Sanskrit, mathematics and physics, before settling on the eccentric charms of economics,\" he says. He went to the Presidency College in Calcutta and was soon thrown into the hotbed of political coffee-house debate. His family belonged to the Bengali intellectual elite, and Bengal itself was the most vibrant and politically active city in India. Most of its luminaries were well to the left of Mahatma Gandhi and Nehru. One of Sen's uncles, who belonged to the Congress Socialist Party, was put into preventive detention by the British and spent six years in prison without trial. Another cousin, in the Communist party, was also in gaol. Although Sen eagerly joined in the arguments, he says: \"I could not develop enough enthusiasm to join any political party.\" It was an early sign of his detachment from collective action, as well as the pragmatic caution which have stayed with him, in spite of his moral engagement and intellectual boldness. In the early 60s, when he was at Trinity College, Cambridge, as director of studies, his then wife, Nabaneeta Dev, went on the Aldermaston ban-the-bomb marches led by Bertrand Russell. Sen did not. It was partly pressure of work, he says, but \"I had also developed more scepticism of what could be achieved by activism without necessarily weakening on the importance of the cause\". Sen still calls himself a person of the left, but he says he felt something disturbing about the standard leftwing politics of his student days. Most of his friends were Stalinists. He liked their egalitarian commitment but felt they were not open to political pluralism and that they even saw political tolerance as a \"weakness of will\". \"I thought it was a major defect of the Stalinist left not to recognise that establishing democracy in India had been an enormous step forward. There was a temptation to call this sham or bourgeois democracy. The left didn't take seriously enough the disastrous lack of democracy in Communist countries,\" he recalls. This point was to stay with him in his famine studies, when he enunciated the view that no famine has ever occurred in a country with a free press and regular elections. He compared China and India. Although by most indicators, from life expectancy to literacy, Mao's China was ahead of Nehru's India, China had had a catastrophic famine between 1958 and 1961 in which up to 30m people starved to death. There was no free press or alternative political parties to give early warning. In democratic India, free from the Raj, this could not have happened. But Sen did not go overboard in his praise of democracy. He pointed out in his 1984 book, Resources, Values, and Democracy, that while there was no famine in India, a third of the population went to bed hungry every night. \"The quiet presence of non-acute, endemic hunger leads to no newspaper turmoil, no political agitation, no riots in the Indian parliament. The system takes it in his stride,\" he wrote. When Sen arrived in Cambridge at the age of 19 to study economics at Trinity, he found the college \"a bit of an oasis\". The major debates in political economy in the university were raging between neo-classicists and followers of Keynes. Trinity was an unusual model of tolerance ,with the Marxist, Maurice Dobb, doing joint seminars with the conservative, Dennis Robertson. Sen found that this suited his style. He has always rejected any simplistic labelling of people, and his work is constantly peppered with references to earlier economists whom he respects for their views, regardless of the ideological camps which form around them. He takes examples from Adam Smith, as well as Marx, without being a Smithian or a Marxist. In 1960, Sen married Nabaneeta Dev, whom he first got to know when she was a student of comparative literature and he was a young professor at Jadavpur University in Calcutta. He met her off the boat train when she came to England in 1959. He proposed soon afterwards and they had two daughters. Antara, 37, became a journalist and edits a political, cultural, and literary magazine, called The Little Magazine, in Delhi. Nandana, 33, is an actress and film director, and lives in New York and Bombay. In 1970, S en's path-breaking book, Collective Choice and Social Welfare, attempted to rescue welfare economics from the pessimism of free-marketeers, who argued that there was no point in government intervention, and that individuals should be left to choose whatever the market made available in response to their choices, and statists, who concluded that authoritarian choices had to be made by governments on other people's behalf. Sen argued that perfection in social decision-mak ing is unnecessary. Partial comparisons between people can help and majority decisions do carry weight, as long as the interests of the less assertive citizens are not ignored. His own life, meanwhile, had its periods of turmoil and tragedy. While an undergraduate, he developed cancer of the mouth and he was treated with massive doses of radiation. It whittled away his palate and could have proved fatal: he was unable to eat solid food for three months and doctors said he only had a 15% chance of survival. In 1971 there were fears that the cancer had recurred but, after a while, the diagnosis proved wrong. That same year, Sen left Dev. She had followed him around the various campuses where his work took him, and developed her own academic career in a very different intellectual area. (By the time of the divorce, she was well-known in Bengal as a a writer and professor of literature, and the separation caused a storm there.) He describes her generously \"as one of the best-known literary names in Bengal, a leading poet and novelist\". She has described him as \"a good economist but a bad money manager\", and \"a clumsy father until the children grew old enough to be his students\". Sen later started to go out with Eva Colorni, a brilliant Italian economist from a distinguished anti-fascist family, whom he had met some years earlier. The couple married in 1978, but Colorni died of cancer in 1985, leaving Sen with a 10-year-old daughter, Indrani, and eight-year-old son, Kabir. Partly in search of a change of scene, and partly because he needed a higher salary as a single father of two young children, he left Britain for Harvard. (His first two children stayed with Dev.) In the United States he renewed contact with an old student friend, the brilliant Pakistani economist, Mahbub ul Haq, who persuaded him to join in elaborating the Human Development Index as a rival to the World Bank's system of ranking countries by classical macroeconomic criteria such as savings rates and GNP. \"Amartya gave it intellectual depth and credibility. Before that people thought it was just flaky, feelgood stuff,\" says Richard Jolly, who worked for the United Nations Children's Fund and is writing a history of the UN. \"I'm struck by the way he has made so many contributions to the UN over the last three decades.\" Despite his advice for the UN, Sen has been coy about working for individual governments. He turned down numerous invitations to advise the Indian government. In Britain he has given a talk at one of Gordon Brown's regular economic seminars at 11 Downing Street, but he politely avoids any public comment on New Labour and the Third Way. Sen's empirical work has occasionally been criticised on points of detail, or for not going far enough. Alex de Waal, the author of Famine Crimes, a book which looked at how democracy prevents famine, says the mere fact of democracy is not enough. He also says the main cause of famine is epidemic disease rather than starvation. But he describes Sen's work as \"seminal\". An article Sen wrote in the British Medical Journal, which appeared in the New York Review of Books with the headline, \"More than a Hundred Million Women are Missing\", was picked apart by some demographers. Sen had examined the disturbing fact that while female mortality is generally lower than male mortality at all age-groups in most cultures, this is not the case in India. Because of massive gender inequality, girls have less food and are taken to doctors less than boys. Sen accepts that that criticism of his \"ballpark figure\" was legitimate, but says his main point about inequality cannot be challenged. More substantial criticisms revolve round his role in the current globalisation debate. Richard Jolly, while being an enormous admirer, says: \"On the issue of liberalisation and the opening up of economies, Amartya has been rather mainstream. He hasn't raised very deep questions about the whole process and of globalisation in general. He's more of a mainstream economist than many people realise.\" Meghnad Desai sees a double problem. One is the issue of accessibility. Desai cites Sen's latest book, Development as Freedom, which is based on a set of lectures he gave the World Bank in 1996. Desai describes it as written for the converted, as well as being too dense. (Even though advertised as the work of a Nobel laureate, the book sold less than 3,000 copies in hardback.) \"Amartya won't admit it but he's very badly hurt if he's criticised . . . He can't let go of this armour of the technical thing. He can't write a tract, or doesn't want to,\" he says. Desai also feels Sen has failed to come clean on a major change of mind. \"He used to be anti-market and very sympathetic to the Nehru line. Then he found a clever way round it. During the past 20 years he's finally made his peace with the market, though on his own terms and without going all-out for a free market. It's a higher form of reconciliation,\" he argues. TN Srinavasan, economics professor at Yale and a long-time colleague, says: \"Many of us were trained in the 50s to believe that states should be active in planning the economy. Sen did not give up that idea until later than some others. He still hasn't added his voice to the call for more privatisation of the Indian economy and the removal of the old Gandhian protection of small-scale producers.\" Sen gets quite heated by the suggestion that he has changed his line on the market. \"Nothing I've ever written was anti-market. Being against the market is like being against conversation. It's a form of exchange,\" he snaps. \"But I was just as hostile in the past to giving any privileges to the market as I am now. Besides, those who are great advocates of the market don't always make it easier for people to have access to the market through basic education, credit or whatever.\" He is also stung by the charge that he is middle of the road. \"That depends on how you define the road. There is a road which you can define in which I am in the middle, but part of my problem is to argue that people should be on a different road. I'm really trying to change the road. My frustration is that I have not being very successful in changing the focus of the debate,\" he says. Even in trying to change the road, Sen's line on globalisation is relatively soft. \"Opponents may see globalisation as a new folly, but it is neither particularly new or a folly,\" he says. He supports the \"themes\" raised by anti-capitalist and environmental protesters at Seattle, Prague and Davos, but not their \"theses\", which he finds too simple. He says the problem is not free trade, but the inequality of global power. He strongly welcomes the rise of the NGO movement, which combines with media coverage to produce the beginning of some \"countervailing power\" to the larger corporations and the traditional policies of first world governments. But he also attaches blame to many third-world governments for not undertaking domestic reform. He argues that the United Nations has to be saved from insolvency and given a greater leadership role which escapes from the asymmetry caused by the veto power of the five richest and/or largest countries. \"There needs to be a watchdog institution which is concerned with inequality and fair trade, asks why the USA and Europe are so restrictive to products from the third world, and raises questions about the pricing policy of the drug companies,\" he says. For the past 10 years, Sen has been married to the economic historian, Emma Rothschild, an expert on Adam Smith and Fellow of King's. The two children he brought up on his own have done well. Indrani is a journalist in New York and Kabir teaches music at a school in Boston, and has a rock band called Uncle Trouble.

Prof Sen was awarded the medal for \"his insights into the causes of poverty, famine, and injustice\", Mr Obama said. Prof Sen is the first Asian to win the Nobel Prize in Economics. The 2011 National Humanities Medal was given to Kwame Anthony Appiah, John Ashbery, Robert Darnton and Andrew Delbanco, among others. Prof Sen is currently a professor of economics and philosophy at Harvard University. \"We even have an economist, which we don't always get on stage,\" Mr Obama said referring to 78-year-old Prof Sen, before he presented the medal to him at a White House function. \"By applying philosophical thinking to questions of policy, he has changed how standards of living are measured and increased our understanding of how to fight hunger,\" the citation read. Prof Sen then went on stage to receive the medal from Mr Obama. The economist is also the recipient of India's highest civilian honour, the Bharat Ratna or the Jewel of India. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1998 for his contribution towards understanding the underlying causes of famine. Prof Sen has written or edited more than 30 books on economics and philosophy. He has also written widely on violence, peace, development, equality and cultural identity. \"I don't really find the division between the subjects contrary to human understanding,\" he once said. \"But if someone were to say to me, you're an economist and you can't study philosophy, that would be contrary to how the human mind works.\" The BBC is not responsible for the content of external Internet sites Home Minister P Chidambaram says \"a well-trained person\" carried out Monday's attack on an Israeli diplomat in Delhi.

He is also the chairman of the NU governing body. The appointment has been made by the President and it was announced by governing body member and former foreign minister of Singapore, George Yeo, after the daylong meeting here on Thursday. Sen said the first two schools on ecology & environment and historical studies will start in 2014. After the approval of its architectural design, the construction work and appointment of faculty members will start simultaneously. \"There will be seven postgraduate schools in the university. Two more schools of Information & Technology and Economics & Management will come up,\" Sen told media. \"Initially, 100 students in each of the two schools will be enrolled,\" NU VC Gopa Sabharwal said. She also announced the formation of two bodies, an endowment committee, to be headed by board member and JD(U) MP N K Singh for raising funds from non-government sources, and an international advisory panel headed by George Yeo. \"The Thai princess has agreed to be a member of the panel while Lord Meghnad Desai is another member. The confirmation of other dignitaries is awaited,\" said Yeo. The meeting endorsed and adopted the recommendations of the Nalanda Monitoring Committee (NMC). That included an airport in Nalanda and inclusion of school on peace studies. The board is also taking note of the suggestion made by chief minister Nitish Kumar on Thursday during luncheon meeting with the members. The CM suggested the board members to include school of basic science in the NU. \"We will see in what shape this subject is taught in other universities in the world,\" Sen added. The next meeting of the board will be held on February 13, 2013, at Rajgir. In November, 2012, the NMC, headed by Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia, will meet here. The NMC's first meeting was held in Delhi last month. Sen said by January next, the architectural design agency will be selected through global competition.

Amartya Sen, previously the Master of Trinity College, Cambridge, and now a professor of economics and philosophy at Harvard, is also the first Indian, indeed Asian, to win the Nobel Prize in economics. Yet what makes him unique is none of these things. Sen is special because he is the first economist-philosopher whose work has consciously touched the lives of millions of the poorest people in the world. His Poverty and Famines has changed the way famines are understood and cured. His idea is simple: people die during famines not because there is no food available but because they do not have the incomes to buy the food. Create incomes for the starving and the food will appear in the shops.

In tackling terrorism, we are in real danger of demonizing certain identities—being a Muslim, for example—which diminishes the person so labeled as well as those doing the labeling. Sen argues that the notion of a clash between civilizations is the disease rather than the diagnosis of our current troubles.

Amartya Sen is one of the world's most influential intellectuals. The Nobel Prize-winning Indian economist is also a philosopher, concerned with problems moral as well as material. His notion of measuring human development has become central to the work of the United Nations and the World Bank. The impact of his thinking on inequalities of \"capability\" as well as inequalities of income and wealth can be seen in everyone from the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, to politicians in Britain.

Her father's sincerity, love and respect for his work enthralled and attracted Bipasha to work in the same line. She wanted to give the audience the flavour of the same simplicity her father managed to present. The motivation to be a famous face was never the guiding force in her taking up the profession of acting. \"Acting is like mathematics,\" explains this self-critic of her evolution as an actress. \"You need to know the theory as well as its application. Practice, concentration and dedication are quintessential.\" Since the initial years, she has done extensive research and studies on acting and attended numerous workshops. Elaborating on the correlation between acting and mathematics, Bipasha says \"How much an eyebrow should be raised for a shot in relation to the facial expression, how many degrees should a head be aligned in a particular direction, these all have to be calculated. It's all very arty and complicated.\"Not only has Bipasha been the leading tele-serial actress for years, but she has also emerged into playwriting. Her first brush with writing came when she wrote the serial Shudhui tomake jani in 1997. Using a pseudonym, she took the script to three leading artistes of the time. After the serial was telecast it was a raging success and Bipasha was confident that it was her talent and not the \"Bipasha name tag\" that got appreciated. However, it took her seven more years to take the prospect of writing seriously. This born perfectionist never felt she was ready until her husband Tauquir Ahmed insisted that she start writing. \"Writing is like a spark of genius. A thought comes suddenly and I get so engrossed with it that I feel the characters haunting me until I have done each one justice.\" An innovative writer, sketching the lead character with shades of good and bad is her specialty. \"Every human has a good and bad side, why should heroes be different and be larger than life?\" In her upcoming serial Ontormomo, Bipasha deals with the complexities of human character. It is the story of a girl who is confused. She is possessive and illogical yet a good person at heart. There is a boy she loves but doesn't want to marry. Bipasha has also completed a 13-episode serial that will be released soon. Her husband has been like a rock foundation in all her projects. In her own words, \"Tauquir has always been there for me. We respect each other's work tremendously and are always there for each other.\" A complete woman, Bipasha Hayat is a lover of ancient civilisations and connoisseur of art. With a Master's degree in Fine Arts from the Institute of Fine Arts, DU, someday she wants to hold a solo exhibition. \"I am my own critic and I know the time is not yet ripe for a solo exhibition,\" explains Bipasha. \"Acting is like mathematics,\" explains this self-critic of her evolution as an actress. \"You need to know the theory as well as its application.

It's not Tom Selleck. It's Shah Rukh Khan. If you haven't heard of him, it's not surprising, unless you live outside the U.S. Khan, 48, is one of the biggest stars of India's film industry, which is the global phenomenon called Bollywood. Not only is he known as the \"Tom Cruise of India,\" according to IMDB, his earnings are on par with the \"Mission Impossible\" actor. Actually, SRK, as he is sometimes called, is worth $120 million more than Cruise, according to research company Wealth-X. He started out with television roles in India and then starred in the film hit \"Deewana\" in 1992. He's won a slew of awards and most recently was nominated for \"Best Actor\" in the film \"Chennai Express,\" at the 15th Annual International Indian Film Academy's Weekend & Awards in Tampa last month. Two years ago, Khan was detained by U.S. authorities for unspecified reasons after arriving on a private plane to an airport in White Plains, New York. The actor said he was stopped because he had a Muslim name, the BBC reported. He was also detained in 2009 for two hours in Newark Airport until the Indian embassy intervened. The 2012 incident enraged the public in India and the customs authorities later apologized. The actor was on his way to a function at Yale University, and he later joked about it with the students. \"Whenever I start feeling arrogant about myself, I always take a trip to America. The immigration guys kick the star out of stardom,\" he said to laughter from the audience,\" he said. Here are the wealthiest actors in Hollywood and Bollywood, according to Wealth-X. 1.

He starred in the television sitcom Bosom Buddies, but became far more known when he starred in the Ron Howard film Splash. He went on to headline many more popular and acclaimed movies, including Big, Forrest Gump and Cast Away, en route to becoming one of the most powerful and well-respected actors in Hollywood. Hanks was born on July 9, 1956, in Concord, California. Hanks' parents divorced when he was 5 years old, and he was raised, along with his older brother and sister, by his father, a chef named Amos. The family moved frequently, finally settling in Oakland, California, where Hanks attended high school. After graduating in 1974, Hanks attended junior college in Hayward, California. He decided to pursue acting after reading and watching a performance of Eugene O'Neill's The Iceman Cometh (1946), and transferred into the theater program at California State University in Sacramento. In 1977, Hanks was recruited to take part in the summer session of the Great Lakes Shakespeare Festival in Lakewood Ohio. Over the next three years, Hanks spent his summers acting in various productions of Shakespeare's plays and his winters working backstage at a community theater company in Sacramento. He won the Cleveland Critics Circle Award for Best Actor in 1978, for his portrayal of Proteus in The Two Gentlemen of Verona. By 1980, Hanks had dropped out of college, and after his third season with the Great Lakes festival, he moved to New York City. Many rounds of auditions later, he landed a small part in the 1980 slasher film He Knows You're Alone. That same year he was spotted by a talent scout for ABC and was cast in the television sitcom Bosom Buddies, playing one of two advertising executives who dress in drag in order to rent an apartment in an all-female building. The show was cancelled after two seasons, but it gave Hanks some exposure and led to his casting in guest roles on various episodes of popular shows like Happy Days (1974-84), Taxi (1978-83), The Love Boat (1977-87) and Family Ties (1982-89). In 1982, Ron Howard, co-star of Happy Days and now working as a director, remembered Hanks and had him read for a supporting part in a movie. That supporting role eventually went to John Candy, and Hanks instead landed the lead role in Howard's Splash (1984) as a man who falls in love with a mermaid, played by Daryl Hannah. The movie became a surprise hit, and Hanks was suddenly a recognizable face. A string of panned films followed, most notably Bachelor Party (1984), The Man With One Red Shoe (1985), Volunteers (1985), The Money Pit (1986) and Dragnet (1987). Hanks managed to emerge relatively unscathed from these critical failures, as reviewers often pointed to his performance as the best thing about each movie. Penny Marshall directing Tom Hanks in 'Big.' Photo: Courtesy of Everett Collection In 1988, Hanks was finally cast in a star-making role in director Penny Marshall's Big, playing a 13-year-old boy transplanted overnight into the body of a 35-year-old man. His performance charmed both critics and audiences, and earned him his first Academy Award nomination for best actor. With Big, Hanks established that he could be a box-office draw as well as a talented actor. Over the next few years, his projects failed to match the critical or commercial success of that film, although they did display Hanks' wide range, from lighthearted comedies (1989's Turner and Hooch, 1990's Joe Versus the Volcano) to more dramatic fare (1988's Punchline, 1990's Bonfire of the Vanities). Following a memorable performance as the manager of an all-women's baseball team in A League of Their Own (1992), Hanks enjoyed two huge hits in 1993: Sleepless in Seattle, a romantic comedy written by Nora Ephron that rematched him with his Joe Versus the Volcano co-star Meg Ryan; and Philadelphia, co-starring Denzel Washington. In the latter film, Hanks played a lawyer fired from his high-paying firm because he has AIDS, delivering a courageous performance that earned him an Academy Award for best actor. He followed up on that tremendous year with the release of Forrest Gump (1994), the sprawling story of an unlikely hero's path through 20th-century American history, directed by Robert Zemeckis. The film was a phenomenal box office success, winning Oscars for best picture and director. For his part, Hanks brought home his second straight lead actor Oscar, becoming the first person in 50 years to accomplish that feat. In 1995, Hanks starred in another blockbuster, Apollo 13, a Howard film based on the abortive lunar landing mission of the Apollo 13 spacecraft in 1970. The film was released in the IMAX format in 2002. Like Forrest Gump, the film made more than $500 million at the box office. Also in 1995, he headlined the voice cast of Toy Story, the first major film of the Disney/Pixar partnership. The following year, Hanks made his directorial and screenwriting debut with That Thing You Do!, which enjoyed moderate success. He continued his behind-the-camera duties in the Emmy-winning HBO miniseries From the Earth to the Moon, which he produced, directed, wrote and acted in for various episodes. In 1998, he starred in another groundbreaking blockbuster, Saving Private Ryan, a World War II drama directed by Steven Spielberg and filmed with gruesome accuracy. While the film was nominated for director and actor Academy Awards and was a favorite for best picture, only Spielberg took home the Oscar. Also that year, Hanks teamed once more with Ryan and Ephron in the hit romantic comedy You've Got Mail. Hanks soared to the top of the holiday box office in late 1999 as he reprised his role as the voice of Woody, the cowboy at the center of 1995's animated film Toy Story. Toy Story 2, also featuring the voice of Tim Allen, surpassed all expectations at the box office, grossing a record-breaking $80.8 million when it opened over Thanksgiving weekend. He also starred in The Green Mile during this time, which shot to No. 2 at the box office, behind Toy Story 2, in its opening weekend. The film was set in a Depression-era prison and adapted from a story by Stephen King. Hanks underwent a striking physical transformation to play a man stranded on a desert island in his next film, the long-awaited Cast Away (2000), directed by Zemeckis and co-starring Helen Hunt. His performance propelled the film to the top of the holiday box office, earning Hanks critical raves and yet another well-deserved Oscar nomination for best actor. Having already notched an imposing record of box office hits, his accessible good looks and regular-guy charisma earning him comparisons with screen legends of the past like Jimmy Stewart, Cary Grant, Henry Fonda and Gary Cooper, Hanks in 2002 was honored with the American Film Institute's Lifetime Achievement Award, making him the youngest actor ever to receive that honor. In 2002, Hanks produced the surprise hit My Big Fat Greek Wedding, starring Nia Vardalos. He was back on the big screen in 2004 with Joel and Ethan Coen's remake of the classic 1955 comedy The Ladykillers, Spielberg's comedy-drama The Terminal and the family film The Polar Express. The A-list actor also continued his producing work with the Imax space documentary Magnificent Desolation (2005) and Evan Almighty (2007). Hanks was next seen in the highly anticipated The Da Vinci Code (2006), based on the bestselling novel by Dan Brown and co-starring Audrey Tatou. The film grossed more than $750 million worldwide. During the 2007 Christmas season, Hanks appeared as the lead in Charlie Wilson's War, a drama based on a Texas congressman's efforts to assist Afghan rebels in their war with the Soviets. The performance earned Hanks a Golden Globe nomination. In 2009, Hanks starred in Angels and Demons, the sequel to Da Vinci. He went on to perform voiceover work for the acclaimed TV miniseries The Pacific (2010) and Toy Story 3 (2010), before starring in Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close (2011) and Cloud Atlas (2012). After a monumental screen career, Hanks made his Broadway debut in the 2013 production of Lucky Guy. He impressed enough to garner a Tony Award nomination for best performance by a lead actor, but lost out to Tracy Letts of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? Also in 2013, Hanks played the title character of the nautical thriller Captain Phillips and portrayed Walt Disney in Saving Mr. Banks, which focuses on how the studio head convinced P.L. Travers, played by Emma Thompson, to grant permission to make Mary Poppins a cinematic project. After Hanks was seen strutting his stuff in popster Carly Rae Jepsen's music video \"I Really Like You,\" critics greatly took to his portrayal of a U.S. attorney in the Cold War thriller Bridge of Spies. The autumn 2015 outing saw the actor reunited with director Spielberg. In November 2016, Hanks received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Barack Obama for his contribution to the arts. In 2017, Hanks teamed up with Meryl Streep for Spielberg's The Post, about the drama surrounding the Washington Post's publication of the Pentagon Papers during the Vietnam War. Once again, the veteran actor's performance was lauded by critics and led to another Golden Globe nomination. Tom Hanks as Mister Rogers in 'A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood' Photo: Lacey Terrell/©2019 CTMG, Inc. In January 2018, it was announced that Hanks had signed on to play Mister Rogers in an upcoming biopic, eventually titled A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood. The project was based on a 1998 Esquire profile by Tom Junod, which recounted the writer's experience of meeting and befriending the beloved children's TV star. Hanks slipped seamlessly into the role of the kindly Rogers, picking up his sixth Oscar nomination following the film's November 2019 theatrical release. Hanks met his first wife, actress and producer Samantha Lewes (real name: Susan Dillingham), while he was in college. They were married in 1978 and had two children, Colin and Elizabeth, before divorcing in 1987. In 1988, he married actress Rita Wilson, with whom he co-starred in Volunteers. Hanks and Wilson have two children, Chester and Truman. In an October 2013 appearance on The Late Show with David Letterman, Hanks revealed that he was facing a major health challenge. \"I went to the doctors and they said, 'You know those high blood sugar numbers you've been living with since you were 36? Well, you've graduated. You've got Type 2 diabetes,'\" he said. In March 2020, Hanks announced via Instagram that he and his wife had tested positive for the coronavirus while in Australia.

He starred in the television sitcom Bosom Buddies, but became far more known when he starred in the Ron Howard film Splash. He went on to headline many more popular and acclaimed movies, including Big, Forrest Gump and Cast Away, en route to becoming one of the most powerful and well-respected actors in Hollywood.Early Life and CareerHanks was born on July 9, 1956, in Concord, California. Hanks' parents divorced when he was 5 years old, and he was raised, along with his older brother and sister, by his father, a chef named Amos. The family moved frequently, finally settling in Oakland, California, where Hanks attended high school. After graduating in 1974, Hanks attended junior college in Hayward, California. He decided to pursue acting after reading and watching a performance of Eugene O'Neill's The Iceman Cometh (1946), and transferred into the theater program at California State University in Sacramento. In 1977, Hanks was recruited to take part in the summer session of the Great Lakes Shakespeare Festival in Lakewood Ohio. Over the next three years, Hanks spent his summers acting in various productions of Shakespeare's plays and his winters working backstage at a community theater company in Sacramento. He won the Cleveland Critics Circle Award for Best Actor in 1978, for his portrayal of Proteus in The Two Gentlemen of Verona.Movies and CareerBig Break With 'Splash'By 1980, Hanks had dropped out of college, and after his third season with the Great Lakes festival, he moved to New York City. Many rounds of auditions later, he landed a small part in the 1980 slasher film He Knows You're Alone. That same year he was spotted by a talent scout for ABC and was cast in the television sitcom Bosom Buddies, playing one of two advertising executives who dress in drag in order to rent an apartment in an all-female building. The show was cancelled after two seasons, but it gave Hanks some exposure and led to his casting in guest roles on various episodes of popular shows like Happy Days (1974-84), Taxi (1978-83), The Love Boat (1977-87) and Family Ties (1982-89). In 1982, Ron Howard, co-star of Happy Days and now working as a director, remembered Hanks and had him read for a supporting part in a movie. That supporting role eventually went to John Candy, and Hanks instead landed the lead role in Howard's Splash (1984) as a man who falls in love with a mermaid, played by Daryl Hannah. The movie became a surprise hit, and Hanks was suddenly a recognizable face. A string of panned films followed, most notably Bachelor Party (1984), The Man With One Red Shoe (1985), Volunteers (1985), The Money Pit (1986) and Dragnet (1987). Hanks managed to emerge relatively unscathed from these critical failures, as reviewers often pointed to his performance as the best thing about each movie.Penny Marshall directing Tom Hanks in 'Big.'Photo: Courtesy of Everett CollectionMajor Hit: 'Big' In 1988, Hanks was finally cast in a star-making role in director Penny Marshall's Big, playing a 13-year-old boy transplanted overnight into the body of a 35-year-old man. His performance charmed both critics and audiences, and earned him his first Academy Award nomination for best actor. With Big, Hanks established that he could be a box-office draw as well as a talented actor. Over the next few years, his projects failed to match the critical or commercial success of that film, although they did display Hanks' wide range, from lighthearted comedies (1989's Turner and Hooch, 1990's Joe Versus the Volcano) to more dramatic fare (1988's Punchline, 1990's Bonfire of the Vanities).Oscar Wins for 'Philadelphia' and 'Forrest Gump'Following a memorable performance as the manager of an all-women's baseball team in A League of Their Own (1992), Hanks enjoyed two huge hits in 1993: Sleepless in Seattle, a romantic comedy written by Nora Ephron that rematched him with his Joe Versus the Volcano co-star Meg Ryan; and Philadelphia, co-starring Denzel Washington. In the latter film, Hanks played a lawyer fired from his high-paying firm because he has AIDS, delivering a courageous performance that earned him an Academy Award for best actor. He followed up on that tremendous year with the release of Forrest Gump (1994), the sprawling story of an unlikely hero's path through 20th-century American history, directed by Robert Zemeckis. The film was a phenomenal box office success, winning Oscars for best picture and director. For his part, Hanks brought home his second straight lead actor Oscar, becoming the first person in 50 years to accomplish that feat.Blockbusters: 'Apollo 13,' 'Toy Story,' 'Saving Private Ryan' In 1995, Hanks starred in another blockbuster, Apollo 13, a Howard film based on the abortive lunar landing mission of the Apollo 13 spacecraft in 1970. The film was released in the IMAX format in 2002. Like Forrest Gump, the film made more than $500 million at the box office. Also in 1995, he headlined the voice cast of Toy Story, the first major film of the Disney/Pixar partnership. The following year, Hanks made his directorial and screenwriting debut with That Thing You Do!, which enjoyed moderate success. He continued his behind-the-camera duties in the Emmy-winning HBO miniseries From the Earth to the Moon, which he produced, directed, wrote and acted in for various episodes.Scroll to ContinueREAD NEXTMiles Teller(1987–)Barney Frank(1940–)Ben Whishaw(1980–) In 1998, he starred in another groundbreaking blockbuster, Saving Private Ryan, a World War II drama directed by Steven Spielberg and filmed with gruesome accuracy. While the film was nominated for director and actor Academy Awards and was a favorite for best picture, only Spielberg took home the Oscar. Also that year, Hanks teamed once more with Ryan and Ephron in the hit romantic comedy You've Got Mail. 'Toy Story 2,' 'The Green Mile,' 'Cast Away'Hanks soared to the top of the holiday box office in late 1999 as he reprised his role as the voice of Woody, the cowboy at the center of 1995's animated film Toy Story. Toy Story 2, also featuring the voice of Tim Allen, surpassed all expectations at the box office, grossing a record-breaking $80.8 million when it opened over Thanksgiving weekend. He also starred in The Green Mile during this time, which shot to No. 2 at the box office, behind Toy Story 2, in its opening weekend. The film was set in a Depression-era prison and adapted from a story by Stephen King. Hanks underwent a striking physical transformation to play a man stranded on a desert island in his next film, the long-awaited Cast Away (2000), directed by Zemeckis and co-starring Helen Hunt. His performance propelled the film to the top of the holiday box office, earning Hanks critical raves and yet another well-deserved Oscar nomination for best actor. Having already notched an imposing record of box office hits, his accessible good looks and regular-guy charisma earning him comparisons with screen legends of the past like Jimmy Stewart, Cary Grant, Henry Fonda and Gary Cooper, Hanks in 2002 was honored with the American Film Institute's Lifetime Achievement Award, making him the youngest actor ever to receive that honor.'The Da Vinci Code,' 'Charlie Wilson's War' and BroadwayIn 2002, Hanks produced the surprise hit My Big Fat Greek Wedding, starring Nia Vardalos. He was back on the big screen in 2004 with Joel and Ethan Coen's remake of the classic 1955 comedy The Ladykillers, Spielberg's comedy-drama The Terminal and the family film The Polar Express. The A-list actor also continued his producing work with the Imax space documentary Magnificent Desolation (2005) and Evan Almighty (2007). Hanks was next seen in the highly anticipated The Da Vinci Code (2006), based on the bestselling novel by Dan Brown and co-starring Audrey Tatou. The film grossed more than $750 million worldwide. During the 2007 Christmas season, Hanks appeared as the lead in Charlie Wilson's War, a drama based on a Texas congressman's efforts to assist Afghan rebels in their war with the Soviets. The performance earned Hanks a Golden Globe nomination. In 2009, Hanks starred in Angels and Demons, the sequel to Da Vinci. He went on to perform voiceover work for the acclaimed TV miniseries The Pacific (2010) and Toy Story 3 (2010), before starring in Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close (2011) and Cloud Atlas (2012). After a monumental screen career, Hanks made his Broadway debut in the 2013 production of Lucky Guy. He impressed enough to garner a Tony Award nomination for best performance by a lead actor, but lost out to Tracy Letts of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? 'Saving Mr. Banks,' 'Bridge of Spies,' 'The Post'Also in 2013, Hanks played the title character of the nautical thriller Captain Phillips and portrayed Walt Disney in Saving Mr. Banks, which focuses on how the studio head convinced P.L. Travers, played by Emma Thompson, to grant permission to make Mary Poppins a cinematic project.After Hanks was seen strutting his stuff in popster Carly Rae Jepsen's music video \"I Really Like You,\" critics greatly took to his portrayal of a U.S. attorney in the Cold War thriller Bridge of Spies. The autumn 2015 outing saw the actor reunited with director Spielberg. In November 2016, Hanks received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Barack Obama for his contribution to the arts.In 2017, Hanks teamed up with Meryl Streep for Spielberg's The Post, about the drama surrounding the Washington Post's publication of the Pentagon Papers during the Vietnam War. Once again, the veteran actor's performance was lauded by critics and led to another Golden Globe nomination.Tom Hanks as Mister Rogers in 'A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood'Photo: Lacey Terrell/©2019 CTMG, Inc.'A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood'In January 2018, it was announced that Hanks had signed on to play Mister Rogers in an upcoming biopic, eventually titled A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood. The project was based on a 1998 Esquire profile by Tom Junod, which recounted the writer's experience of meeting and befriending the beloved children's TV star. Hanks slipped seamlessly into the role of the kindly Rogers, picking up his sixth Oscar nomination following the film's November 2019 theatrical release.Marriages, Children and Personal LifeHanks met his first wife, actress and producer Samantha Lewes (real name: Susan Dillingham), while he was in college. They were married in 1978 and had two children, Colin and Elizabeth, before divorcing in 1987. In 1988, he married actress Rita Wilson, with whom he co-starred in Volunteers. Hanks and Wilson have two children, Chester and Truman. In an October 2013 appearance on The Late Show with David Letterman, Hanks revealed that he was facing a major health challenge. \"I went to the doctors and they said, 'You know those high blood sugar numbers you've been living with since you were 36? Well, you've graduated. You've got Type 2 diabetes,'\" he said.In March 2020, Hanks announced via Instagram that he and his wife had tested positive for the coronavirus while in Australia.

With a run of believeable, ordinary characters and his ability to draw audiences to the box office, it was inevitable that Hanks would become one of the most powerful players in Tinseltown.

Since then, Travolta has starred in blockbusters in several different genres, including comedies such as \"Look Who's Talking\" and more-violent films such as cult film \"Pulp Fiction\" and \"Face/Off.\" But not all films Travolta has starred in have been successful. In 2000, Travolta's \"Battlefield Earth\" was released to universally negative reviews, didn't make back its production budget, and was named by the Razzies as the \"Worst Movie of the Decade\" in 2010. Total film gross: $4.3 billion Average film gross: $93.3 million Films: 46 Top grossing film: \"Every Which Way But Loose\" Acting Oscars: 0 Clint Eastwood has been a well-known actor for the past 45 years: His first film -- \"A Fistful of Dollars\" -- was released in early 1967. His highest grossing film, the 1978 blockbuster \"Every Which Way But Loose,\" brought in more than $283 million in current dollars. Other films starring Eastwood that have earned more than $150 million include \"Dirty Harry,\" \"The Enforcer\" and, more recently, \"Gran Torino.\" Eastwood also has been a successful director, winning a best director Oscar for \"Unforgiven\" and \"Million Dollar Baby,\" both of which also won Academy Awards for Best Motion Picture of the Year. But he has yet to win an Oscar for his acting. Total film gross: $4.5 billion Average film gross: $95.8 million Films: 47 Top grossing film: \"The Dark Knight\" Acting Oscars: 1 Morgan Freeman was first nominated for an Oscar for his supporting role in the 1987 film \"Street Smart.\" Over the course of his career, Freeman has been an Academy Award nominee five times, winning once, in 2005, for his supporting role in \"Million Dollar Baby.\" Freeman has also starred in a number of major box office hits, including the \"Batman\" trilogy directed by Christopher Nolan -- one of the most successful franchises of all time -- and the comedy \"Bruce Almighty.\" Freeman may be best-known for his voice, and has served as a first- or third-person narrator in a number of movies, including \"The Shawshank Redemption\" and \"March of the Penguins.\" Total film gross: $4.5 billion Average film gross: $122.9 million Films: 37 Top grossing film: \"Thunderball\" Acting Oscars: 1 Sean Connery is one of six actors who have played the role of Ian Fleming's James Bond. Between 1963 and 1983, Connery played the secret agent in seven films. Adjusted for inflation, two of these movies -- \"Goldfinger\" in 1964 and \"Thunderball\" in 1965 -- each earned more than $500 million. Connery also has starred in a number of successful action movies, including \"The Untouchables,\" for which he earned his only Oscar, \"The Rock\" and \"The Hunt for Red October.\" Connery is currently retired as an actor. His last film, released in 2003, was \"The League of Extraordinary Gentleman,\" based on the comic book by Alan Moore. Total film gross: $4.6 billion Average film gross: $117.5 million Films: 39 Top grossing film: \"The Graduate\" Acting Oscars: 2 Although Dustin Hoffman has appeared in nearly 40 movies, his first, 1967's \"The Graduate,\" remains his highest grossing film (adjusted for inflation). For his performance in the movie, Hoffman received the first of his seven Oscar nominations. He went on to win his first Academy Award for his leading performance in the 1979 drama \"Kramer vs. Kramer\" and his second Oscar for his role in \"Rain Man,\" in which he starred alongside Tom Cruise. In all, one-third of Hoffman's films have grossed at least $100 million, ranging from political drama \"All the President's Men\" to the comedy \"Tootsie.\" Total film gross: $5 billion Average film gross: $153 million Films: 33 Top grossing film: \"Top Gun\" Acting Oscars: 0 Tom Cruise is one of just a handful of actors to have grossed more than $5 billion in inflation-adjusted ticket sales. At 23, Cruise starred in \"Top Gun,\" a film that went on to gross $370 million. Other movies starring Cruise that grossed more than $300 million include \"Rain Man\" and the first two \"Mission Impossible\" movies. Cruise has never won an Academy Award, but has been nominated three times for his roles in \"Born on the Fourth of July,\" \"Jerry Maguire\" and \"Magnolia.\" Cruise has also been nominated for seven Golden Globes, winning three.

Among Williams' smash hits were comedies such as \"Mrs. Doubtfire\" and \"Flubber,\" as well as dramas such as \"Dead Poets Society\" and \"Good Will Hunting,\" which earned Williams his only Oscar to date. Williams has also lent his voice to two of the highest grossing animated movies of all time, \"Aladdin\" and \"Happy Feet.\" Total film gross: $5.9 billion Average film gross: $154.6 million Films: 38 Top grossing film: \"Shrek 2\" Acting Oscars: 0 Eddie Murphy, a comedian whose acting career took off at age 19 after he joined \"Saturday Night Live,\" has become one of the most successful comedians of his generation.

Despite his success, Murphy has never won an Academy Award, although he won a Golden Globe in 2006 for his role in \"Dreamgirls.\" On the flip side, Murphy \"won\" a Razzie in 2010 for worst actor of the decade, a honor bestowed upon him for his leading roles in such busts as \"The Adventures of Pluto Nash\" and \"Norbit.\" Total film gross: $7.4 billion Average film gross: $218.3 million Films: 34 Top grossing film: \"Star Wars\" Acting Oscars: 0 Harrison Ford is best known as Han Solo from the original \"Star Wars\" trilogy, which grossed nearly $2.9 billion after adjusting for ticket price inflation, and as the adventurous archaeologist of the \"Indiana Jones\" franchise, which grossed more than $1.8 billion. Beyond those, Ford starred in numerous blockbuster action films and thrillers, including 1985's \"Witness,\" for which he received his only Oscar nomination, 1993's \"The Fugitive,\" and 1997's \"Air Force One.\" Following Disney's acquisition of Lucasfilm in October 2012 and the announcement that new films would be made for the franchise, rumors have circulated that Ford may be open to reprising his role as Han Solo in future \"Star Wars\" movies. Total film gross: $6.2 billion Average film gross: $155.4 million Films: 40 Top grossing film: \"Forrest Gump\" Acting Oscars: 2 Since his film career began in 1984, movies starring Hanks have grossed, on average, more than $155 million apiece in inflation-adjusted ticket sales -- and many have grossed significantly higher.

These rare beings are so powerful at the box office that studios will pay them tens of millions of dollars a picture. Johnny Depp, for example, just signed a contract to make a fifth \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" flick, and there is speculation in the press that he could earn as much as $95 million to reprise his role as Capt. Jack Sparrow. That's about 9 percent of the more than $1 billion the last \"Pirates\" movie grossed worldwide. So, which actors' continued popularity has been responsible for the most billions of dollars in ticket sales? Based on a review of films' gross box office sales, adjusted for ticket price inflation, from online movie data resource Box Office Mojo, 24/7 Wall St. identified the 10 most valuable actors of all time. In order to make the list, an actor needed to star in multiple diverse hits, not just a single powerful franchise. For example, Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson, who starred in all eight installments of the extremely successful Harry Potter series, are both among the top 20 actors based on the gross ticket sales of their films. However, they've only appeared in five other unexceptional movies between them. At this point, they could still be considered one-franchise wonders. By contrast, nearly all the actors who made this list have starred in several high-grossing franchises. Of course, success at the box office is not the same as success with the critics. While half of those who made the list are Oscar winners, as a group, they've received little favor from the award-bestowing cognescenti. Considering that they have 401 films among them, their mere seven acting Oscars does feel a bit scant. But who needs an Academy Award when you can single-handedly turn a film from B-list to blockbuster? These are the 10 most valuable actors of all time. Total film gross: $4.3 billion Average film gross: $99.7 million Films: 43 Top grossing film: \"Grease\" Acting Oscars: 0 After starting his career on the TV show \"Welcome Back, Kotter,\" John Travolta's film career took off in the late 1970s with starring roles in \"Saturday Night Fever,\" which earned him an Oscar nomination for best actor, and \"Grease.\" Adjusted for inflation, these remain the two highest grossing films of Travolta's career. Since then, Travolta has starred in blockbusters in several different genres, including comedies such as \"Look Who's Talking\" and more-violent films such as cult film \"Pulp Fiction\" and \"Face/Off.\" But not all films Travolta has starred in have been successful. In 2000, Travolta's \"Battlefield Earth\" was released to universally negative reviews, didn't make back its production budget, and was named by the Razzies as the \"Worst Movie of the Decade\" in 2010. 10. John Travolta Total film gross: $4.3 billion Average film gross: $93.3 million Films: 46 Top grossing film: \"Every Which Way But Loose\" Acting Oscars: 0 Clint Eastwood has been a well-known actor for the past 45 years: His first film -- \"A Fistful of Dollars\" -- was released in early 1967. His highest grossing film, the 1978 blockbuster \"Every Which Way But Loose,\" brought in more than $283 million in current dollars. Other films starring Eastwood that have earned more than $150 million include \"Dirty Harry,\" \"The Enforcer\" and, more recently, \"Gran Torino.\" Eastwood also has been a successful director, winning a best director Oscar for \"Unforgiven\" and \"Million Dollar Baby,\" both of which also won Academy Awards for Best Motion Picture of the Year. But he has yet to win an Oscar for his acting. 9. Clint Eastwood Total film gross: $4.5 billion Average film gross: $95.8 million Films: 47 Top grossing film: \"The Dark Knight\" Acting Oscars: 1 Morgan Freeman was first nominated for an Oscar for his supporting role in the 1987 film \"Street Smart.\" Over the course of his career, Freeman has been an Academy Award nominee five times, winning once, in 2005, for his supporting role in \"Million Dollar Baby.\" Freeman has also starred in a number of major box office hits, including the \"Batman\" trilogy directed by Christopher Nolan -- one of the most successful franchises of all time -- and the comedy \"Bruce Almighty.\" Freeman may be best-known for his voice, and has served as a first- or third-person narrator in a number of movies, including \"The Shawshank Redemption\" and \"March of the Penguins.\" 8. Morgan Freeman Total film gross: $4.5 billion Average film gross: $122.9 million Films: 37 Top grossing film: \"Thunderball\" Acting Oscars: 1 Sean Connery is one of six actors who have played the role of Ian Fleming's James Bond. Between 1963 and 1983, Connery played the secret agent in seven films. Adjusted for inflation, two of these movies -- \"Goldfinger\" in 1964 and \"Thunderball\" in 1965 -- each earned more than $500 million. Connery also has starred in a number of successful action movies, including \"The Untouchables,\" for which he earned his only Oscar, \"The Rock\" and \"The Hunt for Red October.\" Connery is currently retired as an actor. His last film, released in 2003, was \"The League of Extraordinary Gentleman,\" based on the comic book by Alan Moore. 7. Sean Connery Total film gross: $4.6 billion Average film gross: $117.5 million Films: 39 Top grossing film: \"The Graduate\" Acting Oscars: 2 Although Dustin Hoffman has appeared in nearly 40 movies, his first, 1967's \"The Graduate,\" remains his highest grossing film (adjusted for inflation). For his performance in the movie, Hoffman received the first of his seven Oscar nominations. He went on to win his first Academy Award for his leading performance in the 1979 drama \"Kramer vs. Kramer\" and his second Oscar for his role in \"Rain Man,\" in which he starred alongside Tom Cruise. In all, one-third of Hoffman's films have grossed at least $100 million, ranging from political drama \"All the President's Men\" to the comedy \"Tootsie.\" 6. Dustin Hoffman Total film gross: $5 billion Average film gross: $153 million Films: 33 Top grossing film: \"Top Gun\" Acting Oscars: 0 Tom Cruise is one of just a handful of actors to have grossed more than $5 billion in inflation-adjusted ticket sales. At 23, Cruise starred in \"Top Gun,\" a film that went on to gross $370 million. Other movies starring Cruise that grossed more than $300 million include \"Rain Man\" and the first two \"Mission Impossible\" movies. Cruise has never won an Academy Award, but has been nominated three times for his roles in \"Born on the Fourth of July,\" \"Jerry Maguire\" and \"Magnolia.\" Cruise has also been nominated for seven Golden Globes, winning three. 5. Tom Cruise Total film gross: $4.8 billion Average film gross: $108.4 million Films: 44 Top grossing film: \"Mrs. Doubtfire\" Acting Oscars: 1 After starring on the TV series \"Mork and Mindy,\" Robin Williams began his film career with the title role in \"Popeye\" in 1980, the first of his 16 films that would gross more than $100 million in inflation-adjusted ticket sales. Among Williams' smash hits were comedies such as \"Mrs. Doubtfire\" and \"Flubber,\" as well as dramas such as \"Dead Poets Society\" and \"Good Will Hunting,\" which earned Williams his only Oscar to date. Williams has also lent his voice to two of the highest grossing animated movies of all time, \"Aladdin\" and \"Happy Feet.\" 4. Robin Williams Total film gross: $5.9 billion Average film gross: $154.6 million Films: 38 Top grossing film: \"Shrek 2\" Acting Oscars: 0 Eddie Murphy, a comedian whose acting career took off at age 19 after he joined \"Saturday Night Live,\" has become one of the most successful comedians of his generation. He has been in 11 films that grossed more than $200 million each in inflation-adjusted dollars, ranging from \"Mulan\" to \"The Nutty Professor.\" His two highest grossing films, \"Shrek 2\" and \"Beverly Hills Cop,\" grossed more than a half-billion dollars each. Despite his success, Murphy has never won an Academy Award, although he won a Golden Globe in 2006 for his role in \"Dreamgirls.\" On the flip side, Murphy \"won\" a Razzie in 2010 for worst actor of the decade, a honor bestowed upon him for his leading roles in such busts as \"The Adventures of Pluto Nash\" and \"Norbit.\" 3. Eddie Murphy Total film gross: $7.4 billion Average film gross: $218.3 million Films: 34 Top grossing film: \"Star Wars\" Acting Oscars: 0 Harrison Ford is best known as Han Solo from the original \"Star Wars\" trilogy, which grossed nearly $2.9 billion after adjusting for ticket price inflation, and as the adventurous archaeologist of the \"Indiana Jones\" franchise, which grossed more than $1.8 billion. Beyond those, Ford starred in numerous blockbuster action films and thrillers, including 1985's \"Witness,\" for which he received his only Oscar nomination, 1993's \"The Fugitive,\" and 1997's \"Air Force One.\" Following Disney's acquisition of Lucasfilm in October 2012 and the announcement that new films would be made for the franchise, rumors have circulated that Ford may be open to reprising his role as Han Solo in future \"Star Wars\" movies. 2. Harrison Ford Total film gross: $6.2 billion Average film gross: $155.4 million Films: 40 Top grossing film: \"Forrest Gump\" Acting Oscars: 2 Since his film career began in 1984, movies starring Hanks have grossed, on average, more than $155 million apiece in inflation-adjusted ticket sales -- and many have grossed significantly higher. Hanks' highest grossing film was \"Forrest Gump,\" with an adjusted total of more than $611 million. Other Hanks films that grossed more than $300 million include \"Saving Private Ryan,\" \"Cast Away\" and all three \"Toy Story\" movies. Hanks has been nominated for five Academy Awards and has won two best actor Oscars: for \"Philadelphia\" in 1994, and for \"Forrest Gump\" in 1995. 1.

Nobody much calls him McCarthy any more. It's always Cormac or Ol' Cormac, as in: “You know Cormac grew up here in Knoxville don't you? He went to Catholic High.” And, “It wouldn't surprise me if Ol' Cormac was to win the Nobel Prize one day.” Or, “You know that pretty English dancer who used to run Annie's Restaurant down in the Old City? That was Cormac's wife.” His friends, early fans and a coterie of literary scholars in the Cormac McCarthy Society tend to call themselves Cormackians. To them, he was a “great writer,” “literary genius” and “brilliant stylist” long before his breakthrough novel, All the Pretty Horses (Knopf) pranced on-stage in 1992. They could point to his many prizes, the rave reviews that greeted his previous books—those dark, enigmatic Appalachian novels. Still, most of those books were written in relative obscurity and were remaindered almost immediately. With All the Pretty Horses, McCarthy achieved that marriage of popular success and critical acclaim that (you can bet the ranch, pardner) some writers would kill for. Critics compared the novel to Huckleberry Finn. They remarked on McCarthy's handling of dialogue and character, and his edgy, florid descrip­tions of nature. But a strange disquiet set in among some of McCarthy's early devotees. Take his old friend, Leslie Garrett, who was dying of cancer when McCarthy's most popular book appeared. Garrett, the author of two dark and sombre novels, The Beasts and In the Country of Desire, remarked, “Cormac finally has succeeded in writing a book that won't offend anybody.” It was not a compliment. For those who early on developed a taste for McCarthy's more macabre literary fare, All the Pretty Horses was notable for what it lacked—the heart of darkness that beat all through his earlier works. The novel that won the 1993 National Book Award and spent months on the New York Times Best Sellers List demands less of the reader, emotionally and intellectual­ly (save for translating the Spanish, hombre) than any of his other works. The publication in 1994 of McCarthy's play, The Stonemason (Ecco Press) and his sprawling novel, The Crossing (Knopf) seemed to crystallize a split in his body of work and in the literary establishment's reaction to it. The Stonemason is a brief, complex drama in which McCarthy for the first time displays real human affection and character motivation. Oddly, it's set among members of an afro-American family. The closet drama about a young man coming to terms with his largely absent father garnered little attention. The Crossing was another matter. Some were ready to bestow the Nobel Prize on McCarthy for the sprawling, epic novel. In a splashy, front-page review in the June 12, 1994 New York Times Book Review, poet and scholar Robert Haas declared The Crossing “a miracle in prose.” He all but announced McCarthy's arrival in the pantheon of great world writers, right up there with Shakespeare, Homer, Twain and authors of The Bible. Others were put off by such lavish praise. Some reviewers were puzzled by the structure. The protagonist Billy Parham's three journeys across Mexico in The Crossing seemed at least one too many considering that All the Pretty Horses contained two trips across Mexico and that McCarthy's last novel before that, Blood Meridian (Random House, 1985), was about a journey on horseback through formerly Mexican-American territory, also by a teenaged boy. McCarthy's editor Gary Fisketjon reacted to the occasional bad press in a May 1995 interview. “It's axiomatic in publishing that the thrill of discovery is followed by backlash. But that book (The Crossing) is so great I didn't give a shit what they said about it.'' * Still, if what you know about Ol' Cormac was gleaned from the so-called “Border Trilogy”—All the Pretty Horses, The Crossing and Cities of the Plain (1998)—stormy as they are—you likely have a rather more sunny view of the author than his complete body of work warrants. Those books after all, are lightened by a tone of nostalgia for the old west and Americana in general that is absent in the early books. (And if all you know of the man is what you read in the April 19, 1993 New York Times Magazine profile—McCarthy's one interview of record—you don't know much on that score either, my friend.) The point is, many believe that all of McCarthy's works worth reading arrived before his popular success. I don't subscribe to this view. There is something redemptive about All the Pretty Horses, as if, for the first time, the author acknowledges that spilt blood, far from meaningless, is the price we must pay for the privilege of living. (That spilt blood, in fact, is the price the universe pays for its very existence, Pilgrim). This theme is stated with eloquence on page 282 of that first edition, in the following passage: He thought the world's heart beat at some terrible cost and that the world's pain and its beauty moved in a relationship of diverging equity and that in this headlong deficit the blood of multitudes might ultimately be exacted for the vision of a single flower. Before All the Pretty Horses, Cormac offered scant testimony that existence was worth that cost. The change in attitude and tone was as clear as the change in cadence and substance. They added up to a demarcation in McCarthy's work as pronounced as the Continental Divide. The new style owed as much to Hemingway and Malcolm Lowry as to Faulkner, the writer most often cited as McCarthy's primary influence. Some devotees of the early works find it maddening that those books should be overshadowed by the new, re-invented McCarthy. Their one hope is that, in his early seventies now, the still-trim, physically fit writer will yet come home to the earlier style and sensibility, because clearly there are more books to come. There is also the prospect that the early novels might become movies, in the tradition of All the Pretty Horses (2000, Billy Bob Thornton directing Matt Damon) or TV dramas, such as McCarthy's teleplay for PBS, The Gardener's Son (1977, Ned Beatty and Brad Dourif). “At one point I was told the producers of Miami Vice would be filming Blood Meridian,” Fisketjon told me years back, referring to McCarthy's first western. (But take that word western with a grain of desert sand and a stiff shot of whiskey if you plan on reading it, pardner. Louis L'Amour and Zane Grey never rode here). Blood Meridian, stylistically and substantively, stands at the Great Divide in McCarthy's body of work. It resembles in setting, terrain and gear, his more recent westerns. It's tone, style and dark worldview are blood kin to McCarthy's early black books set in Tennessee, books that a hit film could thrust from the shadows. But then, talk of a movie has gone around for years. I remember during McCarthy's lean days of 1990 hearing Jim Boruff, an old friend of his from college, suggest a McCarthy movie would be made comparing El Paso and Juarez with Sodom and Gomorrah—those decadent cities of the plain mentioned in the Good Book. (Yesssssssss, then again ...) Rumors would rise like primordial ooze in a vast black sea of silence that lapped outward from McCarthy's hideout at the time, a modest house on El Paso's Coffin Street. He could scarcely have chosen a street with a name better suited to his early reputation, and there are those who believe it was a calculated choice, much as his silence, they say, was an act of reverse psychology, nurtured to attract the curious. Ol' Cormac, of course, wasn't talking. * Time was you could depend on such silence. It was as constant a part of McCarthy's mystique as his association with Albert Erskine, who once edit­ed Faulkner and later plucked McCarthy's first novel from a slush pile at Random House. He went on to edit each of McCarthy's first five books. They all garnered wonderful reviews, gained for McCarthy the respect of such literary eminences as Saul Bellow, then quietly faded into the detritus. McCarthy carried on in obscurity. When Erskine retired, McCarthy moved to Knopf and the afore-mentioned Fisketjon, whom Will Blythe, literary editor for Esquire at the time, referred to as “an editor with a feel for marketing.” To outward appearances, that's when everything changed. Esquire ran thirty pages from All the Pretty Horses, the book took off, and suddenly Ol' Cormac was a hot topic. For six months in 1993 I was regarded as something of an authority on McCarthy, thanks to a piece I had written for The Knoxville News-Sentinel (much of it contained in this article). I received phone calls from The London Telegraph, Atlantic Monthly and others trying to locate people I'd interviewed. Almost no one in mainstream publishing knew much about McCarthy. My News-Sentinel article was one of the most extensive pieces written about him until that time. That's less a measure of my journalistic prowess than of McCarthy's high regard for his privacy. None of his old friends quite believed it when he granted an interview to New York Times Magazine. But speaking practically, it was only one in a series of astute moves. For the first time in his life, Ol' Cormac landed on the New York Times bestseller list. At least one thing didn't change. McCarthy continued to turn away from the acclaim. He was in Spain when he won his National Book Award. He really didn't care for such notoriety, he wrote to Garrett, whose cancer clutched his throat in a death-grip at the time. It should have happened to you old friend, McCarthy wrote. “It's almost like superstition,” his brother Dennis once declared. “He's afraid he'll ruin whatever he has going. He tends to be Salinger-esque. I think there's a lot to be said for pushing your books. But then, he's been able to write all these years. I very much respect his sense of pri­vacy. He just doesn't want anything said about him.” Doubtlessly McCarthy blushed at how Garrett described him to me then: “Cormac was a very, very hand­some man. He's a little grayer, but he's still a good-looking man. I said once, `I don't mind that you are a great writer and almost as intelligent as me, but God was very cruel when he made you so good looking.' He's a little vain.” McCarthy's distinguished good looks render him more recognizable than most famous people, and while he's been known to show up unannounced, once in a blue moon, at local watering holes in Knoxville and converse with any fans who happen to be there the stir caused by such appearances serves only to dramatize his otherwise reclusive ways. Close associates tend to say things like, “It isn't snobbery. Cormac lets his books do the talking.” * Confront the books then. Tiptoe up to them. Poke them with a stick, for they bite. Rape, necrophilia, scalpings, beheadings, arson and incest are the enter­prises lovingly portrayed in those early novels. The protagonists are mostly good old boys who love only their mothers. The settings are endless evocations of nature constantly devouring itself, and along with itself, those who lust and labor there. Each of the first three novels is bloodier and more relentlessly bleak, than its predecessor. The Orchard Keeper (1965) recounts the violent feuding, whisky making and whoring of some East Tennessee mountain people in the early part of this century. Outer Dark (1968) chronicles the travels of a mountain woman whose brother has left a child—the product of their incest—in the wilderness to die. Child of God (1973) celebrates Lester Ballard, a man driven to kill young lovers and then copulate with the bodies in his underground lair. Suttree (1979) recounts the comings and goings of a young man from a “good family” who has chosen to live an outcast existence among the derelicts on the waterfront in Knoxville. It too contains its share of spilt blood. Southern Gothic? Maybe. Critics used to complain that McCarthy was derivative of Faulkner, but with each successive book the grounds for such criticisms have eroded. The truth is that in some ways McCarthy is Faulkner's polar opposite. Faulkner was so close to his characters that at times it seemed he was speaking from their very larynxes. McCarthy, on the other hand, keeps his subjects at a distance that, with few exceptions, is galactic and cold. He observes them clinically, descriptively, almost empirically. As Blythe said of his work, “It's almost told from the point-of-view of God, but it's a God who absolutely doesn't care what happens to human beings. McCarthy describes human behavior in much the same way that he talks about the animals in his stories.” Naturalistic? Could be. Yet McCarthy burst out of such categories with Blood Meridian, going beyond mere gothic-ism, mere naturalism, to conjure a feast of bloodletting in the American Southwest. (More than a feast, my friend, a very universe con­signed to gore.) In its unrelenting bleakness, the novel surpasses anything McCarthy wrote before. Here is a more or less typical passage from Blood Meridian: And now the horses of the dead came pounding out of the smoke and the killing ground and clattered from sight again. Dust stanched the wet and naked heads of the scalped who with the fringe of hair below their wounds and tonsured to the bone now lay like maimed and naked monks in the bloodslaked dust and everywhere the dying groaned and gibbered and horses lay screaming. Trust me. I went easy on you. I could have quoted from the beheading scene. Blood Meridian describes a murder, on average, every five pages. There is a symbolic figure, sort of a prophet of carnage, in these pages. A big, hairless, super-intellectual albino known only as The Judge dances and declaims his way through this book, even unto... the end... but then, I won't spoil it for you. Let's just say the ending is so black, so utterly devoid of hope, that surely here is revealed the outer limits of McCarthy's nihilism toward the world. Best to think of something else, like, what kind of man...? * Frontier boys fleeing Tennessee would commonly tack notes to their cabin doors composed of three letters: “GTT.” It meant “Gone To Texas.” Cormac left more than that behind when he trucked down to El Paso by way of Colorado and Arizona in the late 1970s. He left his second wife, Annie Delisle, a pretty English dancer and singer. Delisle became a celebrity of Knoxville nightlife in 1983, after she opened Annie's: A Very Special Restaurant in a gentrified section of town known as the Old City. Later she moved to Florida. Cormac also left Suttree, a novel set squarely in Knoxville. It did for McCarthy what A Death in the Family did for Knoxville's other famous writer of Irish descent, James Agee. It made him a local legend. Unlike Agee, who actually spent very little time in Knoxville, McCarthy knew the city intimately. Also unlike Agee, who shrouded the city in misty impressions, McCarthy cataloged it relent­lessly, chronicling its back-alley decadence, its fecal decay, its mal­odorous mania. The terrain of Suttree is replete with rotted fish, used comdoms, raw sewage and blood bucket taverns. Yet, the story, set in 1951, is compelling, the characters sympathetic if not exactly appealing. More than any other denizen of McCarthy's world, the title character is his alter ego. Like many another figure you find in Southern literature, Suttree is a young man who has lost faith in fam­ily, tradition, formal education and old time religion. Aimlessly, he wanders a decaying terrain. He lives on a houseboat in the filthy Tennessee River near First Creek and survives by fishing for carp and catfish. Yet the characters surrounding him breathe life into the book. There is the country sheriff who sees Suttree's life as an indictment of modern, atheistic education. As he tells Suttree: “I will say one thing; you've opened my eyes. I've got two daughters, oldest fourteen, and I'd see them both in hell fore I'd send them up to that university.” Then there is the mountain boy arrested early on for his... um, amorous attentions to watermelons. When Suttree asks him about the charge, the following exchange takes place: “Harrogate grinned uneasily. They tried to get me for beast, beast....” “Bestiality?” “Yeah, but my lawyer told 'em a watermelon wasn't no beast. He was a smart son of a bitch.” Still, it's Suttree himself, wandering lost among fallen people in a fallen world that is most compelling. Reading Suttree, you sense that, for once, you glimpse the author. For McCarthy also walked the streets of Knoxville, “this city con­structed on no known paradigm, a mongrel architecture reading back through the works of man in a brief delineation of the aberrant disordered and mad.” The details are too rich, the language too true for McCarthy not to have known intimately the people and places of which he sings. * The houses in which he grew up, along with five siblings, still stand. The McCarthys lived in an unassuming home, but in an affluent section of Knoxville known as Sequoyah Hills, where Cormac was brought from Providence, R.I., by his parents, Mr. and Mrs. Charles J. McCarthy, in 1937, when he was four. Later they moved about 10 miles away to Martin Mill Pike, a sinuous drive into the leafy countryside of South Knox County. When I saw it, the white, gabled structure was choked with weeds and debris, but once it was structurally sound and dignified. “Cormac ran all these forests and hills,” Annie Delisle said in her singing English accent as she drove past the house on a summer's day years ago. “He used to put his traps out here; he trapped muskrats and things.” McCarthy left home in the late 1950s. He attended the University of Tennessee in 1951-52. Evidently he had some sort of falling out with his father, top legal counsel for TVA. The elder McCarthy was in the air so much that he was one of only four Knoxvillians in Trans World Airline's Million Mile Club at the time. A symptom of the rift may have been McCarthy's name-change. Christened Charles McCarthy, like his father, McCarthy changed it to Cormac because, according to Garrett, he didn't like associations with one Charlie McCarthy, the famous wooden dummy that played comedian to ventriloquist Edgar Bergen's straight man. While the motivation to change his name appears obvious enough now, one can see how an already estranged father might have taken the act as a personal affront. Perhaps the name he chose hints at his own sense of destiny. Cormac is taken from the name of the ancient Irish hero who built the Blarney Castle. At any rate, the record shows that McCarthy joined the Air Force in 1953 for four years, two of them in Alaska, where he hosted a radio show. After mustering out, he visited San Francisco, checking out the haunts of famous Beat writers of the day, according to friends, then returned to UT, 1957-59, where he published two stories, “A Drowning Incident” and “Wake for Susan,” in the student literary magazine, The Phoenix. McCarthy left the university again, this time for good, to finish The Orchard Keeper, while working as an auto mechanic in Chicago, according a short biographical sketch on the Cormac McCarthy Society website, www.cormacmccarthy.com, by Marty Priola. At some point he married Lee Holleman, a former UT student. The couple lived for a time in Sevier County, Tennessee. They had one son, Lee McCarthy, now the author of several books of poetry. That marriage soon ended, however, and McCarthy lived the single life again, running with a fast crowd according to old friends, who, well, made up that fast crowd. Drug use, drunken binges and sexual escapades were common among the bohemian youth of the time. Often, to escape distraction, McCarthy would take road trips or put up in a local motel or stay in the cabin of friends in the nearby Smoky Mountains. There he would write, bolstered by the William Faulkner Foundation Award for his first novel, The Orchard Keeper. Gary Goodman, a former classmate, used to visit the hideaway where McCarthy lived for a time while working on his second book, Outer Dark. “We're climbing around, up this beautiful mountain,” remembered Goodman. “We get up on top, the two of us, looking around. We found these big old boulders, massive, 500 to 1,000 pounds. We got to rolling them down the side of the mountain, out there crazy, laughing, knock­ing down trees five and six inches in diameter. I remember we rolled over a stone once and there was a scorpion.” Cormac might have milked the episode for five pages of abstruse and violent prose. Yet McCarthy is a gentle man, from all accounts. “Everybody I know admires him,” said Delisle. “The man is very disciplined and dedicated to his work, and that's admirable in anybody, isn't it?” * Delisle swathed her memories in tenderness, when she recalled her ­times with Cormac. “It was a romance, it was a wonderful romance,” she said in a throaty, lilting English accent. She was 24 and perform­ing on a luxury passenger ship, the Sylvania, when she met McCarthy. He was in his mid-30's, flush with money from his Faulkner Prize and bound for Ireland. “We met the first night out to sea. He was dancing with a beautiful blonde. We saw each other across the ballroom and fell madly in love. We spent the whole trip together. We used to stay up all night watching the moon on the sea. He was going to Ireland, where his ancestors were from. “I had been traveling. A friend and I had a `sister act,' and we sang and danced and traveled all over the world. Cormac sort of followed us around. We were married in England in an old Norman church built in 1100 in Hamble, Hampshire. “The quality that Cormac loved in me at that time was that I was childlike, naive in many things, just so happy to share. He was kind of a teacher. We bought an old XK-120 Jaguar with no roof on it, and he fixed it all up in Paris and we drove it through Geneva and all the way around through Italy and down the south coast of France to Barcelona.” Eventually the pair were lured to Ibiza, the bohemian island enclave off the coast of Spain. “Ibiza was all writers and musicians, and I think it was like people were trying to recapture a feeling of 1920s Paris with Hemingway and all that stuff. It never quite made it, but still it was an exciting time.” Garrett was there, fresh from his own literary success, having won the Maxwell Perkins Award for his first novel, The Beasts. Later, Garrett recalled: “We were both young literary lions, circling each other, claws extended. Within five minutes I knew that I had met a future friend. He and Annie and I were The Three Musketeers. We did a lot of carousing, a lot of champagne. Cormac doesn't drink now.” Garrett continued to drink and smoke and take pills for years, and while he was swirling down into a pit of depression, drug dependency, and writer's block, McCarthy returned to Tennessee with his bride. There he finished Child of God. He also returned to an unwieldy manuscript that would become Suttree. Already he had spent many years on it. In their modest homes, Cormac would compose all day, sometimes while lying in bed. DeLisle would type up the pages. Suttree was distilled from a manuscript that numbered nearly 2,000 pages, said DeLisle. It was a curious introduction to the new land she had chosen to live in. “I was still young and this was the other side of the world to me,” she recalled. “He had five brothers and sisters and lots of nieces and nephews who were especially kind to me. We lived in Rockford in a little house for $50 a month, a little pig farm, just out-rage-ous. “He didn't carry insurance. He was such a rebel that he didn't live the same kind of life anybody else on earth lived. He knew everything that was going on. We did everything there was to do in life,” she said mysteriously. Later they made a home from an upgraded barn on thirty acres near Knoxville, where they lived for most of the 70s. A photo album tells some of the story. There is a picture of DeLisle, pretty, petite, dancing in the studio she operated for local dancers. There is a photo of McCarthy holding a copperhead snake in one hand and the pistol he shot it with in the other. “He caught that under the lawn mower one day and he shot it and skinned it for me and I kept it, so you can imagine it was quite an eye-opener.” There is a picture of a stone chimney, another of a little stone room. “He did every bit of that work himself. All the rocks that you see, we used to pick them up on the side of the road and from the fields. He got wood that he had cut, kiln-dried at a lumber mill in Townsend.” McCarthy was working on Suttree for most of those years, and living off grants. There was never enough money and no children, something DeLisle regrets. There were hints that McCarthy was prepared to break out of his obscurity. He had been working on The Gardener's Son, a drama similar to The Stone Mason, in that chronicles fraternal and paternal conflicts steeped in oedipal overtones. During the shooting, McCarthy enjoyed the company of another woman, and a permanent split with DeLisle seemed inevitable. Still, when it came, DeLisle was crushed. “We were together eight or nine years, completely together, then not together. I've sat and thought and thought for hours. Some strange things had happened, then just—one New Year's Eve, it must have been '76—he said `Well, I'm going.' “For a month he was packing the truck, and it was standing outside the door and he was packing things into it, and for a month I was crazy. I could not believe that was happening. He took me out for my birthday. We went to The Orangery (an upscale restaurant) and we had a wonderful dinner. The next day he got up and got into his little `U-Haul-It' and took off and I took off after him, then turned off and went to Lexington, Kentucky, for a few weeks. “I guess I just never believed it would happen. It's like when somebody dies, the only time you realize it has happened is when you're throwing the earth over the coffin.” That word again. * On some level, McCarthy is death-obsessed. Yet Garrett defended McCarthy's fascination with the morbid. “Lester Ballard (the necrophiliac in Child of'God) is one of the most con­temptible human beings in all of American literature. What a remark­able thing. This man is detestable and yet he is a child of God and therefore the more to be pitied. When it comes to the truth about our place on earth and who we are and what we are, I would look to Cormac before I would, say, Rod McKuen. The fact that his vision is dark, so what? Life isn't a picnic.” At times, however, it was, even for a writer with McCarthy's dark visions. “After he would write, he would say, Well, it's cocktail time,” recalled DeLisle. “Then he'd take a shower as if washing all that stuff out of his hair. We'd light a candle, have a nice dinner, we'd talk and laugh. Those were the best of times, the most exquisite times, the times when everything was right with the world.” Both Garrett and DeLisle label McCarthy a chameleon. “On the one hand he was sophisticated,” she said. “He loved the niceties of life, but he would live on the levels that people would understand. He would sit by the old pot-bellied stove, spit and chew tobacco. That's how he lived.” Doubtlessly it was around such stoves that he garnered much of the grist for his literary mill. Lately the chameleon has displayed softer hues. The question is, which colors will be showing when McCarthy's long-awaited ninth novel is complete? Some look for a darker, more gritty read, as if Ol' Cormac were baiting a trap. In McCarthy's world, a bloody maw awaits the unwary. (Welcome to the sunny Southwest... Dear Friend...) But that's not the way I see it. For McCarthy lives and works near the end of a trail that can be followed by the attentive scout. The spoor starts in Tennessee, embraces and rejects the world at once, heads west into hell, crosses the Great Divide, to emerge in a landscape of solace if not hope. Friends say he can often be seen at social gatherings in El Paso, Santa Fe, Knoxville and abroad. McCarthy married his third wife, Jennifer, about the time Cities of the Plain saw print. They have one child. The McCarthys moved from El Paso to Santa Fe, where he's at work on his next novel, due within the next year from Knopf. If name is more than metaphor, and something lies buried on El Paso's Coffin Street, it could be the corpse of the author's most nihilistic visions. Washed in the mystic blood of his own complex mythos, McCarthy writes his way toward redemption. He rides the pretty words of resounding language into the blood-stained skies of a setting sun.

This locality forms the background for many of his descriptions of the common man’s everyday life. He was raised in moderate circumstances, yet he was on equal terms with the workers’ families in this rather diversified area. While studying at Stanford University, he often had to earn his living by working on the ranches. He left Stanford without graduating and, in 1925, went to New York as a freelance writer. After bitter years of struggling to exist, he returned to California, where he found a home in a lonely cottage by the sea. There he continued his writing. Although he had already written several books by 1935, he achieved his first popular success in that year with Tortilla Flat. He offered his readers spicy and comic tales about a gang of paisanos, asocial individuals who, in their wild revels, are almost caricatures of King Arthur’s Knights of the Round Table. It has been said that in the United States this book came as a welcome antidote to the gloom of the then prevailing depression. The laugh was now on Steinbeck’s side. But he had no mind to be an unoffending comforter and entertainer. The topics he chose were serious and denunciatory, as for example the bitter strikes on California’s fruit and cotton plantations which he depicted in his novel In Dubious Battle (1936). The power of his literary style increased steadily during these years. The little masterpiece Of Mice and Men (1937), which is the story of Lennie, the imbecile giant who, out of tenderness, alone squeezes the life out of every living creature that comes into his hands, was followed by those incomparable short stories which he collected in the volume The Long Valley (1938). The way had now been paved for the great work that is principally associated with Steinbeck’s name, the epic chronicle The Grapes of Wrath (1939). This is the story of the emigration to California which was forced upon a group of people from Oklahoma through unemployment and abuse of power. This tragic episode in the social history of the United States inspired in Steinbeck a poignant description of the experiences of one particular farmer and his family during their endless, heartbreaking journey to a new home. In this brief presentation it is not possible to dwell at any length on individual works which Steinbeck later produced. If at times the critics have seemed to note certain signs of flagging powers, of repetitions that might point to a decrease in vitality, Steinbeck belied their fears most emphatically with The Winter of Our Discontent (1961), a novel published last year. Here he attained the same standard which he set in The Grapes of Wrath. Again he holds his position as an independent expounder of the truth with an unbiased instinct for what is genuinely American, be it good or bad. In this recent novel, the central figure is the head of a family who has come down in the world. After serving in the war, he fails at whatever he tries until at last he is employed in the simple work of a grocery store clerk in the New England town of his forefathers. He is an honest man and he does not complain without due cause, although he is constantly exposed to temptation when he sees the means by which material success must be purchased. However, such means require both hard scrupulousness and moral obduracy, qualities he cannot muster without risking his personal integrity. Tellingly displayed in his sensitive conscience, irradiated like a prism, is a whole body of questions which bear on the nation’s welfare problems. This is done without any theorizing, using concrete, or even trivial, everyday situation, which are nonetheless convincing when described with all of Steinbeck’s vigorous and realistic verve. Even with his insistence on the factual, there are harmonic tones of daydreaming, fumbling speculations around the eternal theme of life and death. Steinbeck’s latest book is an account of his experiences during a three-month tour of forty American states Travels with Charley, (1962). He travelled in a small truck equipped with a cabin where he slept and kept his stores. He travelled incognito, his only companion being a black poodle. We see here what a very experienced observer and raisonneur he is. In a series of admirable explorations into local colour, he rediscovers his country and its people. In its informal way this book is also a forceful criticism of society. The traveller in Rosinante – the name which he gave his truck – shows a slight tendency to praise the old at the expense of the new, even though it is quite obvious that he is on guard against the temptation. “I wonder why progress so often looks like destruction”, he says in one place when he sees the bulldozers flattening out the verdant forest of Seattle to make room for the feverishly expanding residential areas and the skyscrapers. It is, in any case, a most topical reflection, valid also outside America. Among the masters of modern American literature who have already been awarded this Prize – from Sinclair Lewis to Ernest Hemingway – Steinbeck more than holds his own, independent in position and achievement. There is in him a strain of grim humour which, to some extent, redeems his often cruel and crude motif. His sympathies always go out to the oppressed, to the misfits and the distressed; he likes to contrast the simple joy of life with the brutal and cynical craving for money. But in him we find the American temperament also in his great feeling for nature, for the tilled soil, the wasteland, the mountains, and the ocean coasts, all an inexhaustible source of inspiration to Steinbeck in the midst of, and beyond, the world of human beings. The Swedish Academy’s reason for awarding the prize to John Steinbeck reads, “for his realistic as well as imaginative writings, distinguished by a sympathetic humour and a keen social perception.” Dear Mr. Steinbeck – You are not a stranger to the Swedish public any more than to that of your own country and of the whole world. With your most distinctive works you have become a teacher of good will and charity, a defender of human values, which can well be said to correspond to the proper idea of the Nobel Prize.

A native of Northern Ireland, Heaney was raised in County Derry, and later lived for many years in Dublin. He was the author of over 20 volumes of poetry and criticism, and edited several widely used anthologies. He won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1995 \"for works of lyrical beauty and ethical depth, which exalt everyday miracles and the living past.\" Heaney taught at Harvard University (1985-2006) and served as the Oxford Professor of Poetry (1989-1994). He died in 2013. Heaney has attracted a readership on several continents and has won prestigious literary awards and honors, including the Nobel Prize. As Blake Morrison noted in his work Seamus Heaney, the author is \"that rare thing, a poet rated highly by critics and academics yet popular with 'the common reader.'\" Part of Heaney's popularity stems from his subject matter—modern Northern Ireland, its farms and cities beset with civil strife, its natural culture and language overrun by English rule. The New York Review of Books essayist Richard Murphy described Heaney as \"the poet who has shown the finest art in presenting a coherent vision of Ireland, past and present.\" Heaney's poetry is known for its aural beauty and finely-wrought textures. Often described as a regional poet, he is also a traditionalist who deliberately gestures back towards the “pre-modern” worlds of William Wordsworth and John Clare. Heaney was born and raised in Castledawson, County Derry, Northern Ireland. The impact of his surroundings and the details of his upbringing on his work are immense. As a Catholic in Protestant Northern Ireland, Heaney once described himself in the New York Times Book Review as someone who \"emerged from a hidden, a buried life and entered the realm of education.\" Eventually studying English at Queen’s University, Heaney was especially moved by artists who created poetry out of their local and native backgrounds—authors such as Ted Hughes, Patrick Kavanagh, and Robert Frost. Recalling his time in Belfast, Heaney once noted: \"I learned that my local County Derry [childhood] experience, which I had considered archaic and irrelevant to 'the modern world' was to be trusted. They taught me that trust and helped me to articulate it.\" Heaney’s work has always been most concerned with the past, even his earliest poems of the 1960s. According to Morrison, a \"general spirit of reverence toward the past helped Heaney resolve some of his awkwardness about being a writer: he could serve his own community by preserving in literature its customs and crafts, yet simultaneously gain access to a larger community of letters.\" Indeed, Heaney's earliest poetry collections— Death of a Naturalist (1966) and Door into the Dark (1969)—evoke \"a hard, mainly rural life with rare exactness,\" according to critic and Parnassus contributor Michael Wood. Using descriptions of rural laborers and their tasks and contemplations of natural phenomena—filtered through childhood and adulthood—Heaney \"makes you see, hear, smell, taste this life, which in his words is not provincial, but parochial; provincialism hints at the minor or the mediocre, but all parishes, rural or urban, are equal as communities of the human spirit,\" noted Newsweek correspondent Jack Kroll. As a poet from Northern Ireland, Heaney used his work to reflect upon the \"Troubles,\" the often-violent political struggles that plagued the country during Heaney’s young adulthood. The poet sought to weave the ongoing Irish troubles into a broader historical frame embracing the general human situation in the books Wintering Out (1973) and North (1975). While some reviewers criticized Heaney for being an apologist and mythologizer, Morrison suggested that Heaney would never reduce political situations to false simple clarity, and never thought his role should be as a political spokesman. The author \"has written poems directly about the Troubles as well as elegies for friends and acquaintances who have died in them; he has tried to discover a historical framework in which to interpret the current unrest; and he has taken on the mantle of public spokesman, someone looked to for comment and guidance,\" noted Morrison. \"Yet he has also shown signs of deeply resenting this role, defending the right of poets to be private and apolitical, and questioning the extent to which poetry, however 'committed,' can influence the course of history.\" In the New Boston Review, Shaun O'Connell contended that even Heaney's most overtly political poems contain depths that subtly alter their meanings. \"Those who see Seamus Heaney as a symbol of hope in a troubled land are not, of course, wrong to do so,\" O'Connell stated, \"though they may be missing much of the undercutting complexities of his poetry, the backwash of ironies which make him as bleak as he is bright.\" As poet and critic Stephen Burt wrote, Heaney was “resistant to dogma yet drawn to the numinous.” Helen Vendler described him as “a poet of the in-between.” Heaney’s first foray into the world of translation began with the Irish lyric poem Buile Suibhne. The work concerns an ancient king who, cursed by the church, is transformed into a mad bird-man and forced to wander in the harsh and inhospitable countryside. Heaney's translation of the epic was published as Sweeney Astray: A Version from the Irish (1984). New York Times Book Review contributor Brendan Kennelly deemed the poem \"a balanced statement about a tragically unbalanced mind. One feels that this balance, urbanely sustained, is the product of a long, imaginative bond between Mr. Heaney and Sweeney.\" This bond is extended into Heaney's 1984 volume Station Island, where a series of poems titled \"Sweeney Redivivus\" take up Sweeney's voice once more. The poems reflect one of the book’s larger themes, the connections between personal choices, dramas and losses and larger, more universal forces such as history and language. In The Haw Lantern (1987)Heaney extends many of these preoccupations. W.S. DiPiero described Heaney's focus: \"Whatever the occasion—childhood, farm life, politics and culture in Northern Ireland, other poets past and present—Heaney strikes time and again at the taproot of language, examining its genetic structures, trying to discover how it has served, in all its changes, as a culture bearer, a world to contain imaginations, at once a rhetorical weapon and nutriment of spirit. He writes of these matters with rare discrimination and resourcefulness, and a winning impatience with received wisdom.\" With the publication of Selected Poems, 1966-1987 (1990) Heaney marked the beginning of a new direction in his career. Poetry contributor William Logan commented of this new direction, \"The younger Heaney wrote like a man possessed by demons, even when those demons were very literary demons; the older Heaney seems to wonder, bemusedly, what sort of demon he has become himself.\" In Seeing Things (1991) Heaney demonstrates even more clearly this shift in perspective. Jefferson Hunter, reviewing the book for the Virginia Quarterly Review, maintained that collection takes a more spiritual, less concrete approach. \"Words like 'spirit' and 'pure'… have never figured largely in Heaney's poetry,\" Hunter explained. However, in Seeing Things Heaney uses such words to \"create a new distanced perspective and indeed a new mood\" in which \"'things beyond measure' or 'things in the offing' or 'the longed-for' can sometimes be sensed, if never directly seen.\" The Spirit Level (1996) continues to explore humanism, politics and nature. Always respectfully received, Heaney’s later work, including his second collected poems, Opened Ground: Selected Poems, 1966-1996 (1998), has been lavishly praised. Reviewing Opened Ground for the New York Times Book Review, Edward Mendelson commented that the volume “eloquently confirms [Heaney’s] status as the most skillful and profound poet writing in English today.\" With Electric Light (2001), Heaney broadened his range of allusion and reference to Homer and Virgil, while continuing to make significant use of memory, elegy and the pastoral tradition. According to John Taylor in Poetry, Heaney \"notably attempts, as an aging man, to re-experience childhood and early-adulthood perceptions in all their sensate fullness.\" Paul Mariani in America found Electric Light \"a Janus-faced book, elegiac\" and \"heartbreaking even.\" Mariani noted in particular Heaney's frequent elegies to other poets and artists, and called Heaney \"one of the handful writing today who has mastered that form as well.\" Heaney’s next volume District and Circle (2006) won the T.S. Eliot Prize, the most prestigious poetry award in the UK. Commenting on the volume for the New York Times, critic Brad Leithauser found it remarkably consistent with the rest of Heaney’s oeuvre. But while Heaney’s career may demonstrate an “of-a-pieceness” not common in poetry, Leithauser found that Heaney’s voice still “carries the authenticity and believability of the plainspoken—even though (herein his magic) his words are anything but plainspoken. His stanzas are dense echo chambers of contending nuances and ricocheting sounds. And his is the gift of saying something extraordinary while, line by line, conveying a sense that this is something an ordinary person might actually say.” Heaney’s prose constitutes an important part of his work. Heaney often used prose to address concerns taken up obliquely in his poetry. In The Redress of Poetry (1995), according to James Longenbach in the Nation, \"Heaney wants to think of poetry not only as something that intervenes in the world, redressing or correcting imbalances, but also as something that must be redressed—re-established, celebrated as itself.\" The book contains a selection of lectures the poet delivered at Oxford University as Professor of Poetry. Heaney's Finders Keepers: Selected Prose, 1971-2001 (2002) earned the Truman Capote Award for Literary Criticism, the largest annual prize for literary criticism in the English language. John Carey in the London Sunday Times proposed that Heaney's \"is not just another book of literary criticism…It is a record of Seamus Heaney's thirty-year struggle with the demon of doubt. The questions that afflict him are basic. What is the good of poetry? How can it contribute to society? Is it worth the dedication it demands?\" Heaney himself described his essays as \"testimonies to the fact that poets themselves are finders and keepers, that their vocation is to look after art and life by being discoverers and custodians of the unlooked for.\" As a translator, Heaney’s most famous work is the translation of the epic Anglo-Saxon poem Beowulf (2000). Considered groundbreaking because of the freedom he took in using modern language, the book is largely credited with revitalizing what had become something of a tired chestnut in the literary world. Malcolm Jones in Newsweek stated: \"Heaney's own poetic vernacular—muscular language so rich with the tones and smell of earth that you almost expect to find a few crumbs of dirt clinging to his lines—is the perfect match for the Beowulf poet's Anglo-Saxon…As retooled by Heaney, Beowulf should easily be good for another millennium.\" Though he has also translated Sophocles, Heaney remains most adept with medieval works. He translated Robert Henryson’s Middle Scots classic and follow-up to Chaucer, The Testament of Cresseid and Seven Fables in 2009. In 2009, Seamus Heaney turned 70. A true event in the poetry world, Ireland marked the occasion with a 12-hour broadcast of archived Heaney recordings. It was also announced that two-thirds of the poetry collections sold in the UK the previous year had been Heaney titles. Such popularity was almost unheard of in the world of contemporary poetry, and yet Heaney’s voice is unabashedly grounded in tradition. Heaney’s belief in the power of art and poetry, regardless of technological change or economic collapse, offers hope in the face of an increasingly uncertain future. Asked about the value of poetry in times of crisis, Heaney answered it is precisely at such moments that people realize they need more to live than economics: “If poetry and the arts do anything,” he said, “they can fortify your inner life, your inwardness.\" Poems to make you one with the sun.

My father had studied philological subjects at Moscow University, but did not complete his studies, as he enlisted as a volunteer when war broke out in 1914. He became an artillery officer on the German front, fought throughout the war and died in the summer of 1918, six months before I was born. I was brought up by my mother, who worked as a shorthand-typist, in the town of Rostov on the Don, where I spent the whole of my childhood and youth, leaving the grammar school there in 1936. Even as a child, without any prompting from others, I wanted to be a writer and, indeed, I turned out a good deal of the usual juvenilia. In the 1930s, I tried to get my writings published but I could not find anyone willing to accept my manuscripts. I wanted to acquire a literary education, but in Rostov such an education that would suit my wishes was not to be obtained. To move to Moscow was not possible, partly because my mother was alone and in poor health, and partly because of our modest circumstances. I therefore began to study at the Department of Mathematics at Rostov University, where it proved that I had considerable aptitude for mathematics. But although I found it easy to learn this subject, I did not feel that I wished to devote my whole life to it. Nevertheless, it was to play a beneficial role in my destiny later on, and on at least two occasions, it rescued me from death. For I would probably not have survived the eight years in camps if I had not, as a mathematician, been transferred to a so-called sharashia, where I spent four years; and later, during my exile, I was allowed to teach mathematics and physics, which helped to ease my existence and made it possible for me to write. If I had had a literary education it is quite likely that I should not have survived these ordeals but would instead have been subjected to even greater pressures. Later on, it is true, I began to get some literary education as well; this was from 1939 to 1941, during which time, along with university studies in physics and mathematics, I also studied by correspondence at the Institute of History, Philosophy and Literature in Moscow. In 1941, a few days before the outbreak of the war, I graduated from the Department of Physics and Mathematics at Rostov University. At the beginning of the war, owing to weak health, I was detailed to serve as a driver of horsedrawn vehicles during the winter of 1941-1942. Later, because of my mathematical knowledge, I was transferred to an artillery school, from which, after a crash course, I passed out in November 1942. Immediately after this I was put in command of an artillery-position-finding company, and in this capacity, served, without a break, right in the front line until I was arrested in February 1945. This happened in East Prussia, a region which is linked with my destiny in a remarkable way. As early as 1937, as a first-year student, I chose to write a descriptive essay on “The Samsonov Disaster” of 1914 in East Prussia and studied material on this; and in 1945 I myself went to this area (at the time of writing, autumn 1970, the book August 1914 has just been completed). I was arrested on the grounds of what the censorship had found during the years 1944-45 in my correspondence with a school friend, mainly because of certain disrespectful remarks about Stalin, although we referred to him in disguised terms. As a further basis for the “charge”, there were used the drafts of stories and reflections which had been found in my map case. These, however, were not sufficient for a “prosecution”, and in July 1945 I was “sentenced” in my absence, in accordance with a procedure then frequently applied, after a resolution by the OSO (the Special Committee of the NKVD), to eight years in a detention camp (at that time this was considered a mild sentence). I served the first part of my sentence in several correctional work camps of mixed types (this kind of camp is described in the play, The Tenderfoot and the Tramp). In 1946, as a mathematician, I was transferred to the group of scientific research institutes of the MVD-MOB (Ministry of Internal Affairs, Ministry of State Security). I spent the middle period of my sentence in such “SPECIAL PRISONS” (The First Circle). In 1950 I was sent to the newly established “Special Camps” which were intended only for political prisoners. In such a camp in the town of Ekibastuz in Kazakhstan (One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich), I worked as a miner, a bricklayer, and a foundryman. There I contracted a tumour which was operated on, but the condition was not cured (its character was not established until later on). One month after I had served the full term of my eight-year sentence, there came, without any new judgement and even without a “resolution from the OSO”, an administrative decision to the effect that I was not to be released but EXILED FOR LIFE to Kok-Terek (southern Kazakhstan). This measure was not directed specially against me, but was a very usual procedure at that time. I served this exile from March 1953 (on March 5th, when Stalin’s death was made public, I was allowed for the first time to go out without an escort) until June 1956. Here my cancer had developed rapidly, and at the end of 1953, I was very near death. I was unable to eat, I could not sleep and was severely affected by the poisons from the tumour. However, I was able to go to a cancer clinic at Tashkent, where, during 1954, I was cured (The Cancer Ward, Right Hand). During all the years of exile, I taught mathematics and physics in a primary school and during my hard and lonely existence I wrote prose in secret (in the camp I could only write down poetry from memory). I managed, however, to keep what I had written, and to take it with me to the European part of the country, where, in the same way, I continued, as far as the outer world was concerned, to occupy myself with teaching and, in secret, to devote myself to writing, at first in the Vladimir district (Matryona’s Farm) and afterwards in Ryazan. During all the years until 1961, not only was I convinced that I should never see a single line of mine in print in my lifetime, but, also, I scarcely dared allow any of my close acquaintances to read anything I had written because I feared that this would become known. Finally, at the age of 42, this secret authorship began to wear me down. The most difficult thing of all to bear was that I could not get my works judged by people with literary training. In 1961, after the 22nd Congress of the U.S.S.R. Communist Party and Tvardovsky’s speech at this, I decided to emerge and to offer One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich. Such an emergence seemed, then, to me, and not without reason, to be very risky because it might lead to the loss of my manuscripts, and to my own destruction. But, on that occasion, things turned out successfully, and after protracted efforts, A.T. Tvardovsky was able to print my novel one year later. The printing of my work was, however, stopped almost immediately and the authorities stopped both my plays and (in 1964) the novel, The First Circle, which, in 1965, was seized together with my papers from the past years. During these months it seemed to me that I had committed an unpardonable mistake by revealing my work prematurely and that because of this I should not be able to carry it to a conclusion. It is almost always impossible to evaluate at the time events which you have already experienced, and to understand their meaning with the guidance of their effects. All the more unpredictable and surprising to us will be the course of future events.

The state or the system encounters an individual who, bafflingly, maddeningly, absurdly, cannot be broken. Should they manage to survive, such heroes have a good chance of outliving the state or the system that so grossly underestimated them. Examples are rather precious and relatively few, and they include Nelson Mandela refusing an offer to be released from jail (unless and until all other political detainees were also freed) and Alexander Solzhenitsyn having to be deported from his country of birth against his will, even though he had become—and had been before—a prisoner there. Two words will always be indissolubly connected to the name of Alexander Isayevich: the acronym GULAG (for the initials of the Stalinist system of penitentiary camps that dotted the Soviet landscape like a pattern of hellish islands) and the terse, harsh word Zek, to describe the starved and overworked inhabitants of this archipelago of the new serfdom. In an especially vivid chapter of his anatomy of that ghastly system, Solzhenitsyn parodied Marxist-Leninist theories of self-determination to argue that the Zeks were indeed a nation unto themselves. In his electrifying first book, One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich, he did in a way delineate the borders and customs of an undiscovered country with a doomed and unknown citizenry. He became an anthropologist of the totalitarian in a way not understood since David Rousset’s L’Univers Concentrationnaire. If you are interested in historical irony, you might care to notice that any one chapter of Ivan Denisovich, published in Novy Mir during the Khrushchev de-Stalinization, easily surpassed in its impact any number of books and tracts that had taken “Socialist Realism” as their watchword. The whole point about “realism”—real realism—is that it needs no identifying prefix. Solzhenitsyn’s work demonstrates this for all time. To have fought his way into Hitler’s East Prussia as a proud Red Army soldier in the harshest war on record, to have been arrested and incarcerated for a chance indiscretion, to have served a full sentence of servitude and been released on the very day that Stalin died, and then to have developed cancer and known the whole rigor and misery of a Soviet-era isolation hospital—what could you fear after that? The bullying of Leonid Brezhnev’s KGB and the hate campaigns of the hack-ridden Soviet press must have seemed like contemptible fleabites by comparison. But it seems that Solzhenitsyn did have a worry or a dread, not that he himself would be harmed but that none of his work would ever see print. Nonetheless—and this is the point to which I call your attention—he kept on writing. The Communist Party’s goons could have torn it up or confiscated or burned it—as they did sometimes—but he continued putting it down on paper and keeping a bottom drawer filled for posterity. This is a kind of fortitude for which we do not have any facile name. The simplest way of phrasing it is to say that Solzhenitsyn lived “as if.” Barely deigning to notice the sniggering, pick-nose bullies who followed him and harassed him, he carried on “as if” he were a free citizen, “as if” he had the right to study his own country’s history, “as if” there were such a thing as human dignity. And, once he succeeded in getting The Gulag Archipelagointo print, even in pirate editions overseas, it became obvious that something terminal had happened to the edifice of Soviet power. Of course, one cannot have everything. Nelson Mandela has been soft on Daniel arap Moi, Fidel Castro, Muammar Qaddafi, and Robert Mugabe, and soft on them even when he doesn’t need them anymore as temporary allies in a difficult struggle. When Solzhenitsyn came to the United States, he was turned away from the White House, on Henry Kissinger’s advice, by President Gerald Ford. But, rather than denounce this Republican collusion with Brezhnev, he emptied the vials of his wrath over Americans who liked rock music. The ayatollahlike tones of his notorious Harvard lecture (as I called them at the time) turned out not to be misleading. As time went by, he metamorphosed more and more into a classic Russian Orthodox chauvinist, whose work became more wordy and propagandistic and—shall we be polite?—idiosyncratic with every passing year. His most recent book, Two Hundred Years Together, purported to be a candid examination of the fraught condition of Russian-Jewish relations—a theme that he had found it difficult to repress in some of his earlier work. He denied that this inquiry had anything in common with the ancient Russian-nationalist dislike of the cosmopolitan (and sometimes Bolshevik-inclined) Jew, and one must give him the benefit of any doubt here. However, when taken together with his partisanship for Slobodan Milosevic and the holy Serb cause, his exaltation of the reborn (and newly state-sponsored) Russian Orthodox Church, and his late-blooming admiration of the cold-eyed Vladimir Putin, the resulting mixture of attitudes and prejudices puts one in mind more of Dostoyevsky than of Tolstoy. Having denounced “cruel” NATO behavior in the Balkans, without ever saying one word about the behavior of Russian soldiers in Chechnya, Solzhenitsyn spent some of his final days in wasteful diatribes against those Ukrainian nationalists who were, rightly or wrongly, attempting to have their own Soviet-era horrors classified as “genocide.” Dostoyevsky even at his most chauvinistic was worth a hundred Mikhail Sholokhovs or Maxim Gorkys, and Solzhenitsyn set a new standard for the courage by which a Russian author could confront the permafrost of the Russian system. “A great writer,” as he put it in The First Circle, “is, so to speak, a secret government in his country.” The echo of Shelley’s remark about poets being the “unacknowledged legislators of the world” may or may not be deliberate. But it serves to remind us that writers, however much they may disown the idea, are nonetheless ultimately responsible for the political influence that they do choose to exert. Therein lies the germ of tragedy. Slate is published by The Slate Group, a Graham Holdings Company. All contents © 2022 The Slate Group LLC. All rights reserved.

As time went by, he metamorphosed more and more into a classic Russian Orthodox chauvinist, whose work became more wordy and propagandistic and—shall we be polite?—idiosyncratic with every passing year. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement His most recent book, Two Hundred Years Together, purported to be a candid examination of the fraught condition of Russian-Jewish relations—a theme that he had found it difficult to repress in some of his earlier work. He denied that this inquiry had anything in common with the ancient Russian-nationalist dislike of the cosmopolitan (and sometimes Bolshevik-inclined) Jew, and one must give him the benefit of any doubt here. However, when taken together with his partisanship for Slobodan Milosevic and the holy Serb cause, his exaltation of the reborn (and newly state-sponsored) Russian Orthodox Church, and his late-blooming admiration of the cold-eyed Vladimir Putin, the resulting mixture of attitudes and prejudices puts one in mind more of Dostoyevsky than of Tolstoy. Having denounced “cruel” NATO behavior in the Balkans, without ever saying one word about the behavior of Russian soldiers in Chechnya, Solzhenitsyn spent some of his final days in wasteful diatribes against those Ukrainian nationalists who were, rightly or wrongly, attempting to have their own Soviet-era horrors classified as “genocide.” Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Dostoyevsky even at his most chauvinistic was worth a hundred Mikhail Sholokhovs or Maxim Gorkys, and Solzhenitsyn set a new standard for the courage by which a Russian author could confront the permafrost of the Russian system. “A great writer,” as he put it in The First Circle, “is, so to speak, a secret government in his country.” The echo of Shelley’s remark about poets being the “unacknowledged legislators of the world” may or may not be deliberate. But it serves to remind us that writers, however much they may disown the idea, are nonetheless ultimately responsible for the political influence that they do choose to exert. Therein lies the germ of tragedy. Tweet Share Comment Advertisement Account Menu Christopher Hitchens Christopher Hitchens Aug 04, 2008 10:35 AM Alexander Solzhenitsyn Share Share Share"]}]}

After being expelled from law school for his political beliefs, Shalamov worked as a journalist in Moscow. In 1929, he was arrested at an underground printshop and sentenced to three years’ hard labor in the Ural Mountains, where he met his first wife, Galina Gudz. The two returned to Moscow after Shalamov’s release in 1931; they were married in 1934 and had a daughter, Elena, in 1935. Shalamov resumed work as a journalist and writer, publishing his first short story, “The Three Deaths of Doctor Austino,” in 1936. The following year, he was arrested again for counterrevolutionary activities and shipped to the Far Northeast of the Kolyma basin. Over the next fifteen years, he was moved from labor camp to labor camp; imprisoned many times for anti-Soviet propaganda; forced to mine gold and coal; quarantined for typhus; and, finally, assigned to work as a paramedic. Upon his release in 1951, he made his way back to Moscow where he divorced his wife and began writing what would become the Kolyma Stories. He also wrote many volumes of poetry, including Ognivo (Flint, 1961) and Moskovskiye oblaka (Moscow Clouds, 1972). Severely weakened by his years in the camps, in 1979 Shalamov was committed to a decrepit nursing home north of Moscow. Following a heart attack in 1980, he dictated his final poems to the poet A. A. Morozov. In 1981, he was awarded the French PEN Club’s Liberty Prize; he died of pneumonia in 1982.

Argument in Defense of the Soldiers in the Boston Massacre Trials.", "references": [" British Broadcasting CorporationHome Accessibility links History John Adams © Adams was a leading figure in the American fight for independence and second president of the United States. During his presidency, Washington became the American capital. John Adams was born on 19 October 1735 in Braintree (now Quincy), Massachusetts, the son of a farmer. Adams graduated from Harvard College in 1755 and became a lawyer. In 1764 he married Abigail Smith, an intelligent and independent woman who provided her husband with considerable support throughout his career. From the mid-1760's, Adams increasingly began to oppose British legislation in its American colony, beginning with the Stamp Act. Despite his hostility to the British government, in 1770 he defended the British soldiers involved in the Boston Massacre. This made him unpopular but marked him out as a man of high principles. At the First and Second Continental Congresses, where he represented Massachusetts, Adams used his considerable writing and speaking skills to persuade other colonists firstly of the need for opposition to Britain, and then of the cause for independence. He served on the committee which drafted the Declaration of Independence. During the Revolutionary War, he ran the Board of War, raising and equipping the American army and creating a navy. In 1778 Adams was sent to Paris on a diplomatic mission. He returned there in 1780 and, in 1783, was one of the three Americans to sign the Treaty of Paris, ending the American War of Independence. Between 1785 and 1788, Adams served as the first American ambassador to Britain. On his return to America, he was elected the first vice-president under George Washington and served for two terms. In the presidential campaign of 1796, which was the first to be contested by political parties, Adams sided with the Federalist Party and was elected president. Deteriorating relations with France led to an undeclared naval war between the former allies. In 1798, Adams signed the controversial Alien and Sedition Acts which limited rights to free speech. They were widely opposed throughout the country. At the same time, Adams faced opposition from within his own party. He resisted their demands for all-out war with France, but lost the 1800 election to Thomas Jefferson. Adams retired from politics and settled in his hometown of Quincy. He died on 4 July 1826, having lived to see the election of his eldest son John Quincy as sixth president. Search term: BBC © 2014 The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

Henry (1862 – 1910) Written by Jonathan Martin William Sydney Porter, or more famously known by his pen name O. Henry, was a popular short story writer during the early twentieth century. A writer whose personal life paralleled his fictional works, Porter lived a varied life throughout the South, Honduras, and New York City. Most importantly though are not the places where Porter traveled but his early childhood in Greensboro, North Carolina. Born on September 11, 1862, to a middle-class family, William was the middle child of three sons. He was only three years old when his mother and brother passed away from tuberculosis. Surviving family members were William’s mother and brother, and they influenced the future author in a drastic way. Grandma Porter, a self-trained doctor and local figure in Greensboro, raised the Porter children after William’s mother passed away. Will’s father and physician, Algernon Porter, cared for his children, but an infatuation with inventing a perpetual motion machine and drinking whiskey hindered him from being a true father figure to William. Despite Algernon’s personal struggles, Will enjoyed a tranquil childhood, and he learned much about writing and literature from his Aunt Lina Porter. From 1867 to 1876, Aunt Lina taught William privately, and he garnered an affinity and knack for storytelling, writing, and drawing. Three years after his studies with his aunt, William apprenticed at the W. C. Porter Company drugstore beginning in 1879. William’s uncle, Clark Porter, allowed him to work at the pharmacy for several years, and he soon became a licensed pharmacist. It was during his time at his uncle’s drugstore that he fell in love with Sara Lindsay Coleman or “Sall.” 19 years old at the time, William was so shy that he could never ask Sall out on a date. In 1881, William left Sara, his family, and North Carolina behind; he headed west to the state of Texas. While in Texas, William became a cowboy of sorts and he earned recognition as a broncobuster. In addition to his knowledge of the frontier, the author became proficient in Spanish, memorized most of Webster’s dictionary, and he started writing stories of the wild west. Yet, William was not confident that the public would accept his work; he never submitted his western stories, destroying stories as soon as he wrote them. Growing in his love of Texas, William decided to move to Austin in 1884. He soon accepted a job as a bank teller at the First National Bank. In 1887, William eloped with Athol Estes, and they would later have a son who died shortly after birth. However, in 1889 the couple had a daughter, Margaret, but Athol’s health worsened drastically after Margaret’s birth. Despite Athol’s health troubles, she continued to encourage William to write and at the request of his wife, he submitted his publications to the Detroit Free Press. William eventually grew bored with his job as a bank teller in Austin, and he decided to start his own magazine called The Rolling Stone. A solo project, William devoted most of his time to writing and drawing for the new magazine, eventually quitting his bank job. The Rolling Stone gained popularity with residents in Austin, but struggling to keep the presses rolling, William had to discontinue the magazine a year shy of its first publication. From 1894 to 1897, William would experience two traumatic events that would eventually spur the true writings from the fledging author. In 1895 William worked as a columnist at the Houston Daily Post, but he was soon ordered to court in Austin on charges of embezzlement during his employment at First National Bank. The manager and owner had filed a report that claimed William had stole nearly $5,000 while he worked at the bank. Upon hearing the charges against him, William made his way to New Orleans where he boarded a boat for Honduras. (Honduras, at that time, had no extradition treaty with the U.S.). While in Honduras, William became friends with Al Jennings, the notorious train robber. Jennings would later write a book about his relationship with the author, and he even claimed that William and his posse had toured across South America. After 7 months in Honduras, William returned to Austin in 1897 because his wife was very ill. Upon his return to Texas, William was formally charged with embezzlement, and his wife died several months later. In February 1898, William, now thirty-five years old, was found guilty and sentenced to five years in prison at the Ohio Penitentiary. When confronted with his crime, William would write his mother-in-law and claim, “I am absolutely innocent of wrongdoing in that bank matter…I care not so much for the opinion of the general public, but I would have a few of my friends still believe there is good in me.”The Ohio Penitentiary was a harsh life for prisoners, but William received partial treatment due to his skills as a pharmacist. Allowed a higher status than the normal prisoner, William was given more free time, and it was during these long night hours that William adopted the pseudonym O. Henry and penned some of his best short stories. Although historians and literary critics disagree, many believed Porter chose the pseudonym “O. Henry” because his childhood cat, Henry the Proud, answered to the young William’s call “Henry, Oh Henry.” However, others believe that William simply wanted a catchy and memorably name. O. Henry wrote numerous short stories while in prison. His first story, “Whistling Dick’s Christmas Stocking,” was published by McClure’s Magazine and became a steppingstone for the author’s success. The mysterious author grew in fame and recognition, but publishers and readers alike were clueless regarding O. Henry’s identity. (William would send his stories to the wife of another incarcerated banker who would then send them along to magazines in the U.S.). O. Henry received widespread acclaim because of his trademark tales of gentle, warm-hearted characters and ironic plot twists at the end of the story. These iconic plot transitions were soon referred to as “O. Henry Endings.” Released in 1901 on good behavior, O. Henry moved to New York at the request of his editor in the big city. He would soon enter a writing spree for Ainslee’s and McClure’s Magazine, and he wrote over 100 short stories in only two years. While living in the city, O. Henry was finally free to experience the urban lifestyle and write about his time in North Carolina, Texas, and his new life in the city. Flourishing in this new habitat, the author was even quoted as saying he “would like to live a lifetime in each street in New York. Every house has a drama in it.” Even though O. Henry wanted a lifetime in the city of New York, fate decided differently. The author would later marry his childhood sweetheart, Sarah Coleman, and he moved to Asheville in 1907. Despite his vigor to continue writing, O. Henry’s health prevented him from fully accomplishing his goal from experiencing every crevice of the Big Apple. He eventually moved back to New York with his wife, but he passed away on June 5, 1910, due to complications from diabetes and other illnesses. O. Henry’s wife took his body back to Asheville, and today the author is buried in the historic Riverside Cemetery. Overlooking a beautiful mountainous landscape, the Riverside Cemetery is also the burial site of other famous North Carolinians including Thomas Wolfe, Robert Brank Vance, and Zebulon B. Vance. From 1910 to 1920, five single volume collections were released after O. Henry’s death. In addition to a complete collection of his most famous works, C. Alphonso Smith, O. Henry’s childhood friend, finished a biography on the author in 1916. O. Henry’s unique plot twists and interesting character personalities influenced the American short story genre to a large extent, particularly his stories “The Ransom of Red Chief,” “The Gift of the Magi,” and “Memoirs of a Yellow Dog.” He would impact other short story authors such as Lilian Jackson Braun, Orson Scott Card, and Helen Eustis. In addition, the O. Henry Festival, founded in 1985, honors the life of William Sydney Porter every April. Presently, Greensboro College hosts the festival as well as mini-dramas that detail the author’s life which are held on his birthday, September 11th, every year. O. Henry’s Tar Heel and middle-class background directly influenced his literary style.. The culture of the Reconstructed South, along with his childhood in Greensboro, affected Porter’s voice and his connection to his birthplace. For example, O. Henry wrote a story that was inspired by the journalist Charles Evans’s fictional character, the Fool-Killer. Originally a writing persona that described his journey through Piedmont North Carolina, the Fool-Killer was a feisty character that would beat any fool he met along his way across the state. Interestingly, even after Porter had moved to New York and transitioned into writing about the big city, the North Carolinian author hoped to pen stories that compared the New South with the antebellum culture shortly before his death. In addition, O. Henry wrote nearly thirty stories during his last years in New York, and all of these short stories were either set in the South or they expounded the intricacies of antebellum culture. “Drugstores, Fiction, Fool-Killer, Riverside Cemetery.” William S.

Henry (1862 – 1910) Written by Jonathan Martin William Sydney Porter, or more famously known by his pen name O. Henry, was a popular short story writer during the early twentieth century. A writer whose personal life paralleled his fictional works, Porter lived a varied life throughout the South, Honduras, and New York City. Most importantly though are not the places where Porter traveled but his early childhood in Greensboro, North Carolina. Born on September 11, 1862, to a middle-class family, William was the middle child of three sons. He was only three years old when his mother and brother passed away from tuberculosis. Surviving family members were William’s mother and brother, and they influenced the future author in a drastic way. Grandma Porter, a self-trained doctor and local figure in Greensboro, raised the Porter children after William’s mother passed away. Will’s father and physician, Algernon Porter, cared for his children, but an infatuation with inventing a perpetual motion machine and drinking whiskey hindered him from being a true father figure to William. Despite Algernon’s personal struggles, Will enjoyed a tranquil childhood, and he learned much about writing and literature from his Aunt Lina Porter. From 1867 to 1876, Aunt Lina taught William privately, and he garnered an affinity and knack for storytelling, writing, and drawing. Three years after his studies with his aunt, William apprenticed at the W. C. Porter Company drugstore beginning in 1879. William’s uncle, Clark Porter, allowed him to work at the pharmacy for several years, and he soon became a licensed pharmacist.

Sir Fred Hoyle, (born June 24, 1915, Bingley, Yorkshire [now West Yorkshire], England—died August 20, 2001, Bournemouth, Dorset), British mathematician and astronomer best known as the foremost proponent and defender of the steady-state theory of the universe. This theory holds both that the universe is expanding and that matter is being continuously created to keep the mean density of matter in space constant. Hoyle was educated at Emmanuel College and St. John’s College, Cambridge, and spent six years during World War II with the British Admiralty, working on radar development. In 1945 he returned to Cambridge as a lecturer in mathematics. Three years later, in collaboration with the astronomer Thomas Gold and the mathematician Hermann Bondi, he announced the steady-state theory. Within the framework of Albert Einstein’s theory of relativity, Hoyle formulated a mathematical basis for the steady-state theory, making the expansion of the universe and the creation of matter interdependent. Einstein assumed that the universe as a whole is static—i.e., its large-scale properties do not vary with time. This assumption, made before American astronomer Edwin Hubble’s observational discovery of the expansion of the universe in 1929, was also natural; it was the simplest approach, as Aristotle had discovered, if one wished to avoid a discussion of a creation event. The notion that the universe on average is not only homogeneous and isotropic in space but also constant in time was philosophically attractive. Hoyle, Bondi, and Gold called it the perfect cosmological principle. In the late 1950s and early ’60s, controversy about the steady-state theory grew. New observations of distant galaxies and other phenomena, supporting the big-bang theory (a phrase that Hoyle had coined in derision in the 1940s), weakened the steady-state theory, and it has since fallen out of favour with most cosmologists. Although Hoyle was forced to alter some of his conclusions, he tenaciously tried to make his theory consistent with new evidence. Hoyle was elected to the Royal Society in 1957, a year after joining the staff of the Hale Observatories (now the Mount Wilson and Palomar observatories). In collaboration with William Fowler and others in the United States, he formulated theories about the origins of stars as well as about the origins of elements within stars. Hoyle was director of the Institute of Theoretical Astronomy at Cambridge (1967–73), an institution he was instrumental in founding. He received a knighthood in 1972. Hoyle is known for his popular science works, including The Nature of the Universe (1951), Astronomy and Cosmology (1975), and The Origin of the Universe and the Origin of Religion (1993). He also wrote novels, plays, short stories, and an autobiography, The Small World of Fred Hoyle (1986).

This theory holds both that the universe is expanding and that matter is being continuously created to keep the mean density of matter in space constant.Hoyle was educated at Emmanuel College and St. John’s College, Cambridge, and spent six years during World War II with the British Admiralty, working on radar development. In 1945 he returned to Cambridge as a lecturer in mathematics. Three years later, in collaboration with the astronomer Thomas Gold and the mathematician Hermann Bondi, he announced the steady-state theory. Within the framework of Albert Einstein’s theory of relativity, Hoyle formulated a mathematical basis for the steady-state theory, making the expansion of the universe and the creation of matter interdependent. Einstein assumed that the universe as a whole is static—i.e., its large-scale properties do not vary with time. This assumption, made before American astronomer Edwin Hubble’s observational discovery of the expansion of the universe in 1929, was also natural; it was the simplest approach, as Aristotle had discovered, if one wished to avoid a discussion of a creation event. The notion that the universe on average is not only homogeneous and isotropic in space but also constant in time was philosophically attractive. Hoyle, Bondi, and Gold called it the perfect cosmological principle.

In the late 1950s and early ’60s, controversy about the steady-state theory grew. New observations of distant galaxies and other phenomena, supporting the big-bang theory (a phrase that Hoyle had coined in derision in the 1940s), weakened the steady-state theory, and it has since fallen out of favour with most cosmologists. Although Hoyle was forced to alter some of his conclusions, he tenaciously tried to make his theory consistent with new evidence.Fred HoyleFred Hoyle.Donne—Hulton Archive/Getty ImagesHoyle was elected to the Royal Society in 1957, a year after joining the staff of the Hale Observatories (now the Mount Wilson and Palomar observatories). In collaboration with William Fowler and others in the United States, he formulated theories about the origins of stars as well as about the origins of elements within stars. Hoyle was director of the Institute of Theoretical Astronomy at Cambridge (1967–73), an institution he was instrumental in founding. He received a knighthood in 1972.

He also wrote novels, plays, short stories, and an autobiography, The Small World of Fred Hoyle (1986).

Six weeks after his birth, Simon and Bertha returned to Henning, Tennessee, and presented Will and Cynthia Palmer with their grandson, Alex Haley. Alex and his mother remained with the Palmers, while Simon returned to Cornell University to complete his graduate studies in agriculture. After the death of Will Palmer in 1926, Simon Haley joined his wife and family in Henning and operated the Palmer business. In 1929, Simon Haley began his teaching career, and the family moved. Two years after they relocated, Bertha Haley died in Normal, Alabama. At the age of fifteen, Alex Haley was graduated from high school. He attended college for two years, then in 1939 he enlisted in the United States Coast Guard as a messboy. While in the Coast Guard, he began writing short stories; it would be eight years later, however, before any of his stories were published. Approximately thirteen years after entering the Coast Guard, Haley became chief journalist. After twenty years of military service, Haley retired in 1959. Upon his retirement, he embarked upon a new career as a writer. He became an assignment writer for Reader's Digest magazine and later was associated with Playboy magazine, where he inaugurated the \"Playboy Interviews\" feature. Soon he was recognized for his insightful and in-depth interviews. His interviews of Malcolm X lead to his first book, The Autobiography of Malcolm X: As Told to Alex Haley (1965). Translated into eight languages, this literary work accorded Haley fame as an author. The stories Haley heard as a youth in the 1920s and 1930s inspired him in 1964 to investigate his maternal ancestry. \"Using the pronunciations of the African words repeated. . .by family members,\" Haley consulted \"linguists at several universities.\" These linguistic specialists verified the language, as well as the village where the words originated. Haley conducted research in the Library of Congress and in Great Britain, where maritime records were available for slave ships. Traveling to the small village of Juffure, in Gambia, West Africa, he met the griot, who gave an oral account of seven previous generations in Mandinka tribal history, back to sixteen-year-old Kunta Kinte, who was wrested from the forest while searching for wood to make a drum. Haley's fact-finding mission verified the oral history preserved by his maternal ancestors. For his trip back to the United States, Haley booked passage on a cargo ship to try to obtain first-hand knowledge of what his ancestor experienced during the three-month \"Middle passage\" to America. For ten nights, he slept on a \"rough board between bales of raw rubber in the 'hold' of the ship.\" He tried to conceptualize what it was like to be shackled and lie in filth and human waste, while closely packed with more than a hundred other human beings. Twelve years later, Haley's research culminated in the 1976 publication of Roots: Saga of An American Family. He called his literary work \"faction,\" meaning that it was a fusion of fact and fiction. Prior to book publication, portions of Roots were condensed in Reader's Digest in 1974. As a result of the unprecedented popularity of Haley's book, the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) produced Roots, a twelve-hour televised miniseries based upon Haley's novel, in 1977. The series set records for the number of viewers and the Sunday night finale achieved the highest rating for a single television production. The Roots miniseries' audience surpassed the Civil War drama, Gone With the Wind, which previously had been the most-watched television broadcast. During the course of the eight-night telecast, Roots was viewed by more than 130 million viewers Two years later, in February of 1979, the ABC-Television network presented Haley's Roots: The Second Generation. Roots in book form sold more than 1.6 million copies in the first six months after publication. The text was translated into thirty-seven languages and was serialized in the New York Post; the dramatic story stimulated interest in the study of Africa and in African American genealogy. Alex Haley received the 1976 National Book Award for Roots. In 1977, Haley received the Pulitzer Prize, as well as the Spingarn Medal from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored. In 1989, Haley became the first person to receive an honorary degree from the Coast Guard Academy. The State of Tennessee honored Haley when it purchased and restored his boyhood home. Historically known as the Palmer House, the ten-room bungalow-style house is located in the small incorporated town of Henning, Tennessee, in Lauderdale County. The first state-owned historic site in West Tennessee and the first state-owned historic site devoted to African Americans in Tennessee, it was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on December 14, 1978. A state historical marker placed at the site tells of Haley's inspiration for Roots. Alex Haley died on February 10, 1992. On February 15, after funeral services in Memphis, his body was conveyed to Henning and interred in the front grounds of the Alex Haley Boyhood Home. Linda T. Wynn ", ""]}]}

BBC News. 21 June 2011.", "references": ["UN/Mark Garten Ban Ki-moon was the eighth Secretary-General of the United Nations. His priorities have been to mobilize world leaders around a set of new global challenges, from climate change and economic upheaval to pandemics and increasing pressures involving food, energy and water. He has sought to be a bridge-builder, to give voice to the world’s poorest and most vulnerable people, and to strengthen the Organization itself. \"I grew up in war\", the Secretary-General has said, \"and saw the United Nations help my country to recover and rebuild. That experience was a big part of what led me to pursue a career in public service. As Secretary-General, I am determined to see this Organization deliver tangible, meaningful results that advance peace, development and human rights.\" Mr. Ban held office from on 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2016. On 21 June 2011, he was unanimously re-elected by the General Assembly for a second mandate. One of the Secretary-General’s first major initiatives was the 2007 Climate Change Summit, followed by extensive diplomatic efforts that have helped put the issue at the forefront of the global agenda. Subsequent efforts to focus on the world’s main anti-poverty targets, the Millennium Development Goals, have generated more than $60 billion in pledges, with a special emphasis on Africa and the new Global Strategy on Women’s and Children’s Health. At the height of the food, energy and economic crises in 2008, the Secretary-General successfully appealed to the G20 for a $1 trillion financing package for developing countries and took other steps to guide the international response and protect the vulnerable and poor. The Secretary-General pressed successfully for the creation of UN Women, a major new agency that consolidates the UN’s work in this area. His advocacy for women’s rights and gender equality has also included the \"Unite to End Violence against Women\" campaign, the \"Stop Rape Now\" initiative, the creation of a \"Network of Men Leaders\" and the establishment of a new Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict. Within the UN itself, the Secretary-General has increased the number of women in senior management positions by more than 40 per cent, reaching the highest level in the Organization’s history. Ban Ki-moon has sought to strengthen UN peace efforts, including through the New Horizons peacekeeping initiative, the Global Field Support Strategy and the Civilian Capacity Review, a package of steps to improve the impact of the 120,000 United Nations \"blue helmets\" operating in the world’s conflict zones. A mediation support unit, along with new capacity to carry out the Secretary-General’s good offices, have been set up to help prevent, manage and resolve tensions, conflicts and crises. Accountability for violations of human rights has received high-level attention through inquiries related to Gaza, Guinea, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, legal processes in Lebanon and Cambodia, and advocacy for the \"responsibility to protect,\" the new United Nations norm aimed at prevent and halt genocide and other grave crimes. He has also sought to strengthen humanitarian response in the aftermath of mega-disasters in Myanmar (2008), Haiti (2010) and Pakistan (2010), and mobilized UN support for the democratic transitions in North Africa and the Middle East. Mr. Ban has sought to rejuvenate the disarmament agenda through a five-point plan, efforts to break the deadlock at the Conference on Disarmament and renewed attention to nuclear safety and security in the aftermath of the tragedy at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. The Secretary-General has introduced new measures aimed at making the United Nations more transparent, effective and efficient. These include heightened financial disclosure requirements, compacts with senior managers, harmonization of business practices and conditions of service, the adoption of International Public Sector Accounting Standards, and continued investments in information technology and staff development. The Secretary-General was born in the Republic of Korea on 13 June 1944. He received a bachelor's degree in international relations from Seoul National University in 1970. In 1985, he earned a master's degree in public administration from the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. At the time of his election as Secretary-General, Mr. Ban was his country's Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade. His 37 years of service with the Ministry included postings in New Delhi, Washington D.C. and Vienna, and responsibility for a variety of portfolios, including Foreign Policy Adviser to the President, Chief National Security Adviser to the President, Deputy Minister for Policy Planning and Director-General of American Affairs. Mr. Ban’s ties to the United Nations date back to 1975, when he worked for the Foreign Ministry's United Nations Division. That work expanded over the years, with assignments that included service as Chairman of the Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Organization and Chef de Cabinet during the Republic of Korea's 2001-2002 presidency of the UN General Assembly. Mr. Ban has also been actively involved in issues relating to inter-Korean relations. Ban Ki-moon and his wife, Madam Yoo (Ban) Soon-taek, whom he met in high school in 1962, have one son, two daughters and three grandchildren. Since 2007, Mrs. Ban has devoted her attention to women’s and children’s health, including autism, the elimination of violence against women, and the campaign to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV/AIDS.

Mr Ban, a former South Korean foreign minister, was the only candidate after the UN Security Council unanimously recommended his re-election. Critics say he is too deferential to major powers, but he has won praise for his policies on climate change and the protests sweeping the Middle East. He took over at the UN in 2007.

However, his low-key approach has sometimes been criticised.
